Unless stated otherwise, the commentaries including this preface are written\nby Soh. This guide is written based on John Tan’s Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment. The\noriginal text will be shown in the next pages, followed by a commentary for each stage. However, it should\nbe noted that the following phases of insights may not unfold in the same exact and linear way for everyone.\nIt is also not hierarchical, and it is not a measurement of importance - even the first phase of realization is\nvery important and precious. (See chapter: On the Non-Linear and Non-Hierarchical Unfolding of Insights)\n6\nPreface\nIt is important to understand that reading these information alone will not by itself bring about the benefits\none finds in actual enlightenment/awakening. Awakening is experiential realization and completely beyond\nthe realm of intellectual understanding. The difference is like night and day, analogous to memorizing a\nrestaurant menu versus actually eating the meal. An intellectual understanding can be a good semblance\nof reality and be a good forerunner to true contemplative insights, however one must be very honest with\noneself and not fall into the mistake of mistaking a conceptual understanding for direct realization. I have\nunfortunately witnessed more than one person over the past decade that have tragically mistaken\nthemselves to be realised after reading the AtR materials. They are only having glimpses of experiences -\nnot realization - and thought themselves to be realized after having a little intellectual grasp of AtR materials.\nIt is easy to deceive oneself of being realized when one has not. Parroting learnt wisdom is not a sign of\nwisdom actualized. One has to look at oneself honestly, how is one living one’s life, am I living life in its utter\npurity and perfection? Can I honestly say that life as experienced in this very moment is perfection and\npurity, the best that life can give and is always giving freely? Is this moment sullied by any identity, grasping\nof self/Self, any holding back from complete openness to the utter fullness of life? Then the real test is in\nthe “marketplace”, in truly living one’s life in complete freedom and peace while engaging in the daily\nencounters of people, things and events, not in armchair philosophizing and conceptualizing about the\nmeaning of life. As John Tan pointed out, by posting so much information about awakening, I can at times\ndo certain people a disservice by providing them with ample information that they churn into an intellectual\nknowledge in disguise and mimicry of real wisdom and freedom. Yet it is my hope that these words can\nserve as pointers -- not as signposts to be collected and hung on one’s wall as a decoration, or made into a\ndogma or belief, but merely as guidance and pointers to one’s destination, which is none other than the\nimmediate nature of mind/universe actualized.\nPersonally, I can say from direct experience that direct realization is completely direct, immediate, and non-\nintellectual, it is the most direct and intimate taste of reality beyond the realm of imagination. It far exceeds\none’s expectations and is far superior to anything the mind can ever imagine or dream of. It is utter freedom.\nCan you imagine living every moment in purity and perfection without effort, where grasping at identity\ndoes not take hold, where there is not a trace or sense of 'I' as a seer, feeler, thinker, doer, be-er/being, an\nagent, a 'self' entity residing inside the body somewhere relating to an outside world, and what shines forth\nand stands out in the absence of a 'self' is a very marvellous, wondrous, vivid, alive world that is full of\nintense vividness, joy, clarity, vitality, and an intelligence that is operating as every spontaneous action\n(there is no sense of being a doer), where any bodily actions, speech and thoughts are just as spontaneous\nas heart beating, fingernails growing, birds singing, air moving gently, breath flowing, sun shining - there is\nno distinction between ‘you are doing action’/’you are living’ and ‘action is being done to you’/’you are being\nlived’ (as there is simply no ‘you’ and ‘it’ - only total and boundless spontaneous presencing).\nThis is a world where nothing can ever sully and touch that purity and perfection, where the whole of\nuniverse/whole of mind is always experienced vividly as that very purity and perfection devoid of any kind\nof sense of self or perceiver whatsoever that is experiencing the world at a distance from a vantagepoint -\n7\nPreface\n- life without ‘self’ is a living paradise free of afflictive/painful emotions (note: I am not proclaiming a state\nof Buddhahood or Arahantship where all traces of mental afflictions are totally obliterated, see this link\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2022/07/buddhahood-end-of-all-emotionalmental.html , and\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood in this AtR guide for more details), where\nevery color, sound, smell, taste, touch and detail of the world stands out as the very boundless field of\npristine awareness, sparkling brilliance/radiance, colorful, high-saturation, HD, luminous, heightened\nintensity and shining wonderment and magicality, where the surrounding sights, sounds, scents, sensations,\nsmells, thoughts are seen and experienced so clearly down to the tiniest details, vividly and naturally, not\njust in one sense door but all six, where the world is a fairy-tale like wonderland, revealed anew every\nmoment in its fullest depths as if you are a new-born baby experiencing life for the first time, afresh and\nnever seen before, where life is abundant with peace, joy and fearlessness even amidst the apparent chaos\nand troubles of life, and everything experienced through all the senses far surpasses any beauty previously\nexperienced, as if the universe is like heaven made of glittering gold and jewels, experienced in complete\ngapless directness without separation, where life and the universe is experienced in its intense lucidity,\nclarity, aliveness and vivifying presence not only without intermediary and separation but without center\nand boundaries - infinitude as vast as an endless night sky is actualized every moment, an infinitude that is\nsimply the vast universe appearing as an empty, distanceless, dimensionless and powerful presencing,\nwhere the mountains and stars on the horizon stands out no more distant than one’s breath, and shines\nforth as intimately as one’s heartbeat, where the cosmic scale of infinitude is actualized even in ordinary\nactivities as the entirety of the universe is always participating as every ordinary activity including walking\nand breathing and one’s very body (without a trace of an ‘I’ or ‘mine’) is as much the universe/dependent\norigination in action and there is nothing outside of this boundless exertion/universe, where the purity and\ninfinitude of the marvellous world experienced through being cleansed in all doors of perception is\nconstant. (If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is: Infinite. For man\nhas closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern. - William Blake)\nYou know all the Mahayana Sutras (e.g. Vimalakirti Sutra), old Zen talks about seeing this very earth as pure\nland and all the Vajrayana talks about the point of tantra as the pure vision of seeing this very world, body,\nspeech and mind in its primordial unfabricated purity as the Buddha field, palace, mandala, mantra and\ndeity? Now you truly get it, you realise everything is really just like that when experienced in its primordial\npurity and perfection, and that the old sages have not been exaggerating at all. It is as much a literal and\nprecise description of the state of consciousness as it is a metaphor. As I told John Tan before, Amitabha\nSutra’s description of pure land resembles my living experience here and now. “To me it just means anatta.\nWhen what’s seen, tasted, touched, smelled are in clean purity, everywhere is pure land.” - John Tan, 2019.\n\"If one is free from background self, all manifestations appear in clean purity in taste. Impurities from what\nI know come from mental constructions.\" – John Tan, 2020\nThis is a freedom that is free from any artificially constructed boundaries and limitations. And yet, this\nboundlessness does not in any way lead to the dissociation from one’s body, instead one feels more alive\nthan ever as one’s very body, one grows ever more somatic, at home and intimate as one’s body. This is\n8\nPreface\nnot a body normally conceived of, as the boundaries of an artificially solidified body that stands separated\nfrom the universe, dissolve into energetic streams of aliveness dancing and pulsating throughout the body\nin high energy and pleasure, as well as sensations of foot steps, movement, palm touching an object, where\nthe body is no longer conflated with a constructed boundary of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, ‘self’ or ‘other’, where\nno trace of an ‘inside’ and an ‘outside’ can be found in one’s state of consciousness - there’s only one\nindivisible, boundless and measureless world/mind - only this infinitude of a dynamic and seamlessly\ninterconnected dance that we call ‘the universe’. This is better than any passing peak experiences be they\narisen spontaneously, in meditation or through the use of psychedelic substances. And yet, despite\nexperiencing life to it fullest every moment without any veils, in complete openness and utter nakedness,\nnothing gains a foothold in consciousness, for as vivid as they are, they leave no trace just as a bird leaves\nno tracks in the sky, an empty and lucid display such as a gust of wind and the glittery reflections of moon\non the ocean waves - appearing but nothing ‘there’ or anywhere. All these words and descriptions I just\nwrote came very easily and spontaneously in a very short time as I am simply describing my current state\nof experience that is experienced every moment. I am not being poetic here but simply being as direct and\nclear as possible about what is immediately experienced. And this is only a figment that I am describing. If\nI were to tell you more of what this is like, you would not believe it. But once you enter this gateless realm\nyou shall see that words always pale in comparison.\nSo forget about memorizing and parroting these words. Simply go contemplate, meditate and practice to\ngain these insights for yourself, then you can easily come up with better words than me and share them\nwith the world. When words genuinely come from your lived experience and realization, they signify\nsomething beyond mere second-hand verbiage, and shine with authenticity. As John Tan said in 2020, “That\nis what I want you to do and express. He didn’t even use a single word like anatta or total exertion. Really\ntalk out of direct authentic experience, clear and right to the point. So you must also do that. Don't keep\nrepeating same thing... anatta, total exertion and emptiness.... be creative and open up to new expressions.”\nHowever you should understand that the experience I described above, which is what I am experiencing\non a daily basis all the time, can only come about via direct realization of the nature of mind. Even after\ndirect realization of the nature of mind, it will almost certainly take several years for the awakening to\nmature. I can say that my depth of awakening has matured by a lot from my initial awakening in 2010, and\nI am still having breakthroughs this year 2019. Anyone who has an initial awakening and think it is final, or\nequivalent to a Buddha or Arahant’s level of attainment is seriously deluded. As Kyle Dixon said in 2013,\n“99% of individuals require integration and familiarization. The non-gradual individuals [cig car ba's] are\nsaid to be as rare as stars in the day time, and the Dalai Lama attests that there hasn't been a cig car ba for\ncenturies.” The Advaitin teacher Vishrant also said, \"the teachers that are flying in and out and telling people\nthey are awake are actually misleading people. The terrible side of that is when somebody is told they are\nawake, the ego grasps it and says, 'I am awake', and then stop seeking, and then these people stop looking\nbecause they think they've already found. So it cuts off their chances for ongoing awakening. It's very sad.\"\n9\nPreface\nTo realize the nature of mind is not the same as having temporary and fleeting peak experiences of what I\nhave described above. Having a peak experience is common and can come about in various ways,\nsometimes spontaneously. You may even (and many/most people do at some point of their lives - although\nmost have forgotten and may need time to recall) have several glimpses of the perfection and purity that I\ndescribe above, absent of any sense of self whatsoever. Even having mere glimpses will be good, because\nat least then, you know from personal experience that I’m not just bullshitting here, that this is all truly\npossible and your confidence in this is born out of your direct experience and not based merely on some\nfickle blind faith in the reports of others. Even then, doubts can still creep back in when the sense of self\nreturns, and from that (deluded) perspective, the paradise one has experienced before seems like a distant\nand hazy dream, rather than a vividly lived reality. To have the experience that I described become a natural\nstate 24/7 requires thorough realisation. Direct realisation, which is far more important than simply having\nexperiences, comes with a doubtless certainty that will never be lost. This guide should hopefully make\nclear the importance and difference between view, realization and experience.\nSome of you may think what I described sounds too good to be true, and probably before my awakening I\nwould have thought that all these are the stuff of pipe dreams and fairy tales. From the perspective of being\na delusory separate self cut off from the infinitude, all these surely seem like a distant dream. From the\nperspective of truth, there is only perfection and purity abound, no doubts about it - it is a direct taste that\nhits you like a powerful blast of arctic air, except it is actually the entire luminous and empty universe that\n‘hits you’ without any trace of a ‘you’, utterly obvious and undeniable. You will know what I mean when\nyou’re actualizing it. Some practitioners who have purportedly gained certain awakening seem to imply that\nenlightenment is a kind of let down. I do not know what their experience, level or depth of enlightenment\nis, but that is wrong and has simply not been the case for me. They haven’t plumbed the depths. In reality,\ntruth and freedom is beyond one’s wildest dreams. I can assure you that this is not fantasy, and I wish that\nyou would see it for yourself and be free.\nThis is a very lengthy guide, but do not fear or be overwhelmed by the amount of information. If you can\nfollow through to the end that’ll be great (though I suspect that at least half or more of the readers won’t\nhave that patience or time or willingness to do so), otherwise I would recommend at least reading through\nthe chapters The Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment and On Anatta (No-Self),\nEmptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection to get an overall picture of the path,\nthen take a very pragmatic approach and focus more on the more practical portions/chapters in this guide\npertaining to where you are at or where you want to be (e.g. focus on the I AM and self-enquiry chapter if\nyou are seeking Self-Realization, or focus on the commentary on Stage 4 and 5 if you are figuring out the\ndifference between non-dual and anatta or trying to realise anatta, etc), and glance through the other\nchapters to see if you find anything helpful or relevant to your practice now. Perhaps in future when you\nread this guide again you will understand more and find other relevant things that previously didn’t “click”,\nso don’t worry or get stuck somewhere if you feel that there’s something which doesn’t make sense to you\nor that there’s something which you can’t understand well at this point in time. That’s what happened to\nme anyway, and I’m sure for everybody else as well - when I read through my old conversations with John\n10\nPreface\nTan and other Buddhist texts, things said and verses that didn’t make sense in the past suddenly becomes\nas clear as day at a later point due to the maturation in insight, experience and practice. Don’t expect to\nunderstand everything the first time, and you don’t have to. Spirituality is not about an intellectual\nknowledge, it is essentially a direct realization, experience, actualization of our true nature and a\ntransmutation of consciousness.\nThe point of this guide is to serve as a guide, and so if it serves to point you in the right direction to your\nnext step, that itself might be good enough, just like it is not necessary to memorise all the signposts in\nyour city - you just need to see or utilize the correct signpost at the correct location, time and situation.\nHaving a thousand signposts in the city is a good thing - that means in every location, the citizen does not\nget lost no matter where he/she is. But that does not mean that all the thousand signposts need to be\ngrasped all at once, or memorised, nor does the citizen need to get overwhelmed by all the different\nsignposts. The signposts just serves a functional purpose, that’s all. The guide is not for the purpose of\ncreating a heady intellectual and conceptual model of what reality is, nor is it like a school or academic\ntextbook for memorising and answering questions at examinations. It is also not meant for intellectual\ncuriosity or gathering of information like a kind of research. That is like being handed the key to paradise\nbut tossing it to the bin instead. Spirituality is about your life, it is about your own existence, it must be\nsomething very alive and intimate. You will eventually find out the truth for yourself through your own\nexperience and practice.\nLastly, I want to emphasize that the crucial takeaway from “Awakening to Reality” is to have clarity on the\nview, realization and experience. The point is not to see the “7 stages” as a form of attainment (although in\nsome sense it may be seen that way and be conventionally true, I generally don’t see it in terms of\nattainment but in terms of View, Realization and Experience). Perhaps it would be more useful to see them\nas facets of our true nature, various aspects which can be revisited and deepened endlessly, a point made\nin the chapter On the Non-Linear and Non-Hierarchical Unfolding of Insights. As a matter of fact, the seventh\nstage stressed that it should be understood as ongoing “practice enlightenment” rather than a static finality.\nThe emphasis in “Awakening to Reality” is on understanding, distinguishing, awakening and integrating\nview, experience and realization. Without clarity on this, there will be obstructions. Too many\npractitioners emphasize on certain aspects - such as skewing to experience only, or on the view only, for\nexample. There is the failure to discern and integrate these aspects, hence John Tan is always emphasizing\non this point. This will be explained in the chapter Importance of View, Realization and Experience.\nForeword by Soh for Nafis’s AtR Practice Guide\nNote: The following Foreword was not written for this document, but for the much shorter AtR Practice\nGuide at https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2022/06/the-awakening-to-reality-practice-guide.html. I just\nwanted to add it here to emphasize the important for dedicated meditation and contemplative practice.\n11\nPreface\n“I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to Nafis Rahman for his great effort in creating The Awakening to\nReality Practice Guide. This guide is a compilation of essential pointers and contemplative exercises, mostly\nderived (although not entirely) from the much larger Awakening to Reality: A Guide to the Nature of Mind\n(https://app.box.com/s/157eqgiosuw6xqvs00ibdkmc0r3mu8jg), written by myself and the AtR Team. This\nPractice Guide is a much-needed, concise version of the original AtR Guide, which has become too lengthy\n(over 1000 pages) and potentially off-putting to readers. After a meticulous review, I've made only minimal\nedits to this streamlined version.\nNafis Rahman, who has underwent rather similar insights in his own path, recognized the need for a more\naccessible guide. With his dedication and compassion, this guide was born, and I believe it will be an\nindispensable tool for countless readers on their spiritual journey. It is my hope that this practice guide will\naid in the awakening of great numbers of fellow spiritual practitioners in the future.\nHowever, I would like to highlight a crucial aspect that seems underemphasized in both this Practice Guide\nand the longer AtR guide: the two additional trainings of Samadhi [meditative composure] and Shila\n[conduct]. These, along with Prajna [wisdom], form the three pillars of the path to liberation. While they\nmight be discussed in the longer AtR guide and more extensively in other resources, their significance is\nundeniable. Meditation also pairs well with inquiry. For instance, during an hour-long meditation session\nalong with self-inquiry in February 2010, I experienced a deep realization of I AM. This commitment to daily\npractice of sitting meditation is shared by John Tan, who dedicates 2-3 hours or more daily even today.\nHowever, for those finding prolonged sessions challenging, even 30 or 45 minutes daily can be\ntransformative.\nHaving the discipline to sit daily is important, even though Samadhi should eventually go beyond the\nsessions of sitting and should equally be integrated into movement, especially with maturity of insight. One\nshould not come under the wrong understanding, however, that Samadhi or meditation practice becomes\nunimportant after attaining certain realizations. Even after the realization of anatta, it is important to\nmaintain a daily practice of Samadhi and have quality time to meditate. For more information, I recommend\nthe following resources: Universally Recommended Instructions\n(https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2016/05/universally-recommended-instructions.html) and\nMindfulness of Breathing: Anapanasati Sutta (https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/mindfulness-\nof-breathing-anapanasati.html). The right meditation posture and technique are vital, and guidance from\nan awakened spiritual teacher (https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/01/finding-awakened-spiritual-\nteacher-and.html and https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/02/teachers-who-realised-anatta.html)\ncan be invaluable. Videos online such as Rinzai Zen at Korinji\n(https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/12/rinzai-zen-at-korinji-why-do-we-sit-in.html) may also be\nuseful.\nDzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith wrote, “Samadhi/dhyāna is a natural mental factor, we all have it.\nThe problem is that we naturally allow this mental factor to rest on afflictive objects such as HBO, books,\n12\nPreface\nvideo games, etc. Śamatha practice is the discipline of harnessing our natural predisposition for\nconcentration, and shifting it from afflictive conditioned phenomena to nonafflictive conditioned\nphenomena, i.e., the phenomena of the path. We do this to create a well-tilled field for the growth of\nvipaśyāna. Śamatha ultimately allows us to have mental stability and suppresses afflictive mental factors\nso that we may eventually give rise to authentic insight into the nature of reality. While it is possible to have\nvipaśyāna without cultivating śamatha, it is typically quite unstable and lacks the power to effectively\neradicate afflictive patterning from our minds. Therefore, the basis of all practice in Buddhadharma, from\nAbhidharma to the Great Perfection, is the cultivation of śamatha as a preliminary practice for germination\nof vipaśyāna.”\nAnd why is right conduct important? It is conducive to a mind free from regrets and remorse, and a more\nstable and clear mind free from ill will or intentions, hatred, greed, and other mental afflictions. This is a\nrequirement for the development of meditative joy and composure of samadhi, which supports the\ndevelopment and maturation of wisdom. This, along with the cultivation of positive mental factors like\nloving kindness, compassion and generosity, will help to dissolve mental afflictions like selfishness, anger,\negoity and develop positive mental factors that can be supportive of the development of samadhi and\nwisdom.

Personally I was quite surprised to find it, but on his\nfacebook groups for example you will find people from here, and elsewhere, who are long term\npractitioners and students of respected teachers, very well educated in the tantras and philosophy, and\ncertainly not the type to typically believe quacks. So make of it what you may, I still don't know what to\nmake of it myself yet... “\nSoh: “Actually I have great respect for Daniel Ingram. He trained in a serious vipassana lineage and his\nrealisation was confirmed and was asked to teach by Sayadaw U. Pandita Jr., and hence I think that he is a\nrather authoritative teacher despite the controversies for using the title “arahant” to describe himself\n(Britanicca: Alternative Titles: arahant, rakan. Arhat, (Sanskrit: “one who is worthy”), Pali arahant, in Buddhism,\na perfected person, one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved nirvana\n(spiritual enlightenment).). (Update: Someone told me this, “Someone linked me this interview by Guru\nViking where Daniel admits that Sayadaw Pandita Jr was sort of vague about telling him that he was an\narahant or that he should share the teachings to others. Later on someone directly contacted Sayadaw\nPandita Jr who said that he didn't give any lineage authorization to Daniel Ingram, and Ingram admits it as\nwell in this video starting from 1:29:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJiy6EJLsI&t=5340s ”) Many\npeople thought Daniel self-proclaimed his attainment to be arahantship, but that is not entirely accurate.\nAs someone wrote in DhO, “…Daniel's claim of arahantship is not just something he makes up and that\nhis teachers disputed. As he says in the section \"Vimuttimagga, The Path of Freedom\" of MCTB2, his 4th\npath was confirmed by Sayada U. Pandita Jr, his teacher during that retreat…” which Daniel replied, “Yes.\nThanks for noticing.” Daniel’s path of practice is more gradual and not necessarily the one I followed.\nHowever, his book Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book\n(Second Edition Revised and Expanded) contains many dharma gems and I would definitely recommend\ngiving it a read, even if it is not a completely similar path. Interestingly, Daniel Ingram was impressed by\n“Thusness” (John Tan in my AtR blog, my mentor), and also said in an interview that he considered\n“Thusness” to be an arahant.\n14\nA Little Background Information\nThat being said, I/we do not agree that his term “arahant” necessarily coincides with the scriptural\ndefinition completely, although John Tan has also spoken positively of Daniel Ingram’s insight and\nrealisation. Like Daniel, we no longer experience subject/object duality or agency, and our practice has led\nus to become generally free from the five poisons (emotional afflictions - see chapter on Overcoming the\nEmotional Afflictions). Nonetheless, John Tan/Thusness and I do not make claims to Arahantship nor\nBuddhahood. To keep this section short, further elaborations can be found towards the end of this\ndocument under the chapter Traditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood. That being\nsaid, Daniel has his reasons for proclaiming attainments -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdQFvJtPpf0 which I see as a valid point.\nThe John Tan 7 stages model was written in 2006 specifically for someone from Canada that he knew was\nripe for certain breakthroughs (which I later reposted in my blog). True enough, that Canadian had a\nbreakthrough just by reading the stages that John wrote then. The 7 stages are based on experiential\ninsights for the purpose of pointing out the subtle points regarding the nature of mind. It is not written\nfor the purpose of claiming that one is an Arahant, Buddha or whatever stage of enlightenment. John Tan\nhad indicated before that he would rather not be associated with the traditional four paths or bhumi\nsystem. We would rather not map the John Tan 7 stages model unnecessarily to other maps of\nenlightenment (it can be complex, messy, controversial, speculative, and perhaps not very fruitful) or\ncreate unnecessary controversies. Although I have informally commented on Mahamudra and Zen maps\nbefore, John Tan and I would also prefer not to compare unnecessarily. Furthermore, we are not in a\nposition of teaching, we are not teachers, we do not have students, nor does our limited time as busy\nlaypersons permit for such an endeavor, nor are we even interested in taking up the burden of ‘teaching’,\nnor are we authoritative figures representing any particular school or lineage, although it is true that in\nthe past, multiple authoritative Zen and other masters and teachers have sought for John Tan’s/AtR’s\nguidance and more than one of them broke through to anatta realisation such as A Zen Exploration of the\nBahiya Sutta - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/ ... sutta.html. However, John Tan has no wish to take\nup the role of teaching, and told me not to portray him/us as ‘teachers’, although he also said that the AtR\nproject has the potential to “be good” or be of benefit to others.\nI have also stated previously that I am not into teaching or portraying myself as a guru. Besides my busy\nlife, I agree with the approach of Daniel Ingram’s forum Dharma Overground that promotes “the spirit of\nmutual, supportive adventurers on the path rather than rigid student-teacher relationships and the\nnotion that the collective wisdom of a group of strong practitioners at various stages and from various\ntraditions and backgrounds is often better than following one guru-type.”, and Greg Goode has also\nwritten well in his article From the Age of the Guru to the Age of the Friend - https://greg-\ngoode.com/article/from-the-age-of-the-guru-to-the-age-of-the-friend/. (Update 2024: I'm not sure I would\nhave quoted Daniel's advice about not following a guru nowadays. I believe that following a teacher can\nbe beneficial and important for people, although the challenge lies in finding a deeply awakened guru.\nRelying on fellow practitioners to guide each other can often be misleading, akin to the blind leading the\nblind, as we frequently observe today.) In my experience, gurus can be helpful or even play an important\n15\nA Little Background Information\nrole in one’s spiritual development, but it is better not to restrict one’s learning to any particular person -\nit is good to go deep (into one’s path and practice) but also learn widely from various people, things and\nsituations. This is not a discouragement from finding a guru or teacher, just to be clear, as I clearly learnt\na lot from John Tan (who does not like to be portrayed as a teacher so I call him my ‘mentor’) and other\nteachers. If you are searching for a guru, read this article by Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/bphtb5/acarya_malcolm_smith_addresses_misconceptio\nns_in/. (Update 2024: Do read Finding An Awakened Spiritual Teacher and Mentor -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/01/finding-awakened-spiritual-teacher-and.html and Teachers\nwho Realised Anatta - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/02/teachers-who-realised-anatta.html)\nHowever, ultimately, the whole universe and the whole of life should become one’s teacher. In\ncontributing to AtR my aim is not to establish myself as a guru, but to share what I think is helpful, as I\nfind that AtR has become a source of inspiration and spiritual breakthroughs for many over time. As of\nnow - Year 2019, about 11 years after the AtR blog was first established, more than 30 people (updated,\n2020: more than 40+ now. Update: 2022: more than 50+ now.) from all over the world have realised at\nleast anatta/John Tan Stage 5 (and further...) through encountering the Awakening to Reality blog, Soh or\nJohn Tan. (Their insights arose not from physically encountering us but by contemplating the AtR\nmaterials that we wrote online or advised, the majority of whom are not from Singapore. Although, a\ncouple of us Singaporeans that attained similar realisations through AtR have casually met up a few times\nafter the realisations)\nWhy am I mentioning that so many people have awakened? Partly because I think this brings the lofty\nideals of \"awakening\" from the realm of stories and myths back to earth. It's the tangible, normal folks\nlike you and me, who achieve awakening, and there are probably more than you think there are. I can\nassure you that I am a very ordinary person, certainly no more special than you or the guy/girl next door,\nalthough due to my awakening I am certainly more joyous and peaceful in character than prior\nawakening, and friends have commended me on this. But otherwise I don’t think people around me will\neven suspect that I had some kind of special awakening unless they truly inquire into my life. (Reminds\nme that there was a monk who, not knowing that the person he just met at a potter’s workshop was in\nfact the Buddha himself, addressed him as a “friend” and informed him that he was actually trying to find\nthe Buddha. The Buddha just played along - not revealing his identity, while he proceeded to give the\nmonk an entire discourse on dharma before the monk finally realised that the person in front of him was\nactually the Buddha himself. I am not trying to compare myself to Buddha, but simply suggesting that\nawakenings need not manifest as halos on the head or some special and obvious ‘vibes’ that everyone\ncan pick up from a mile away) I don’t wear special robes or funny hats, I talk normally with others and not\nin some slow motion trance-inducing tone and tempo, I am by no means some 108th reincarnated avatar\nof the luminous king of Vishnu, so I am just like any other ordinary folk wandering in the marketplace. To\nquote Zen Master Hakuin, “Is he an ordinary man? Is he a sage? The evil ones and the heretics cannot\ndiscern him. Even the buddhas and the patriarchs cannot lay their hands upon him. Were anyone to try to\nindicate his mind, [it would be no more there than] the horns of a rabbit or the hairs of a tortoise that\nhave gone beyond the farthest mountain.” That’s how I’m like, living a life of cosmic immensity and\n16\nA Little Background Information\nrelease in the ordinary. Everything seems the same as before, yet different, because a life where ‘me’ and\n‘mine’ is absent is a very wonderful life indeed. As John Tan said, “the ordinary life when free from\ncompartmentalization is exactly where and when the search ends and what comes after is a human life\nthat is free and full of wonder and amazement”.\nSo the point is that we should not have wrong ideas that awakening is only found in some remote regions\nof the Himalayas, that it is something totally out of the realm of the ordinary and that it necessarily\nrequires remaining in an altered state of consciousness or trance for hours and hours at a time, or that it\nis the arena of some special adept ascetics meditating day and night for 12 years, etc. Examples were\ngiven in \"The Supreme Source: The Fundamental Tantra of Dzogchen Semde Kunjed Gyalpo\" of how some\nof the Dzogchen masters were prostitutes who nevertheless awakened through receiving intimate pith\ninstructions from their masters, and those who became awakened came from all walks of life.\nFurthermore the Zen teachings always emphasize how spirituality or spiritual awakening is never\nseparate from the mundane and ordinary life of \"chop wood, carry water\". And Kunjed Gyalpo tells us,\n\"Seek the location of the heart essence through phenomena that derive from it and come to appreciate it\nthrough the skillful means of not conceptualizing in any way whatsoever. Since the heart essence occurs\nnaturally, dharmakaya is not elsewhere.\" Nirvana is after-all, samsara rightly seen. It is never about\nseparating yourself or becoming distant and aloof from the nitty gritty of daily lives but rather, the\ncomplete gapless/undivided engagement and spontaneous living where even the term 'intimacy' no\nlonger quite apply (who is being intimate with what?)\nAwakening is our birthright, our buddha-nature (potentiality for awakening) is never sealed off from\nanyone nor is it ever the province of an elite group of people. For as Guru Padmasambhava also stated,\n\"If he practices, then even a cowherd can realize liberation. Even though he does not know the\nexplanation, he can systematically establish himself in the experience of it.\" So as I told others before, you\nmust trust in your own capacity. If ordinary folks like me can get it done, then so can you.\nSpiritual awakening used to be relegated to great yogis residing in far off remote places very distant from\nthe lives of ordinary city folks, such that most people will never believe that it is accessible or relevant to\nthe ordinary lay people like you and me. I believe this perception or stereotype will certainly change as\ntime passes.\nTechnologies allow for new possibilities never existing before in history, such as the exchanges between\nsupportive adventurers on the path across thousands of miles, or even become a platform for a\ngathering of strong practitioners at various stages and from various traditions and backgrounds.\nTechnology provides a fertile ground for cross-cultural, cross-traditional exchanges that may foster\ndeeper understandings and fruitful discussions. Add to that, a growing number of people seem to be\nadapting to a \"pragmatic dharma\" attitude of openly sharing from their experiences, transcending old\ndogmas and taboos surrounding the topic of spiritual awakening.\n17\nA Little Background Information\nIn contrast, people living just 50 or 100 years ago aren't nearly as connected to others today, and genuine\nspiritual teachers (much less truly attained and realized spiritual masters) and teachings and fellowships\nmay be limited to certain localities and may be hard to come by. For example, Zen Master Dogen had to\ntravel to China from Japan - a tremendously dangerous feat as sailing in 13th century was dangerous and\nmany who embarked on such a journey had perished, and even then he could not find a master that\ncould awaken him when he reached China. Almost giving up and about to return to Japan, he was so\nfortunate that at the last moment someone told him about Zen Master Rujing, and by learning from him\nDogen attained great awakening. Without meeting the person who introduced Zen Master Rujing, Dogen\nmay not have awakened at all and Japan would not have the Soto Zen of today. Dogen has also said that\nbefore him, there were no masters that was truly awakened in Japan, and he could tell based on the\nwritings, expression and behaviours of past masters. So this is how rare and difficult it is to come by a\ntruly enlightened master in the past. Today, a truly realized spiritual master may be a Skype call away\neven if he/she lives in another country. Nowadays, you can also have an equivalent of Nalanda library\navailable through a mouse-click away, or the entire Buddhist canon available on your iPad, thanks also to\ntranslators at foundations like 84000.co. Also, as John Tan commented before, many practitioners in the\nolden times may not have very strong view due to the lack of easy access to written spiritual texts or\nscriptures (even though they may be very dedicated, disciplined and sincere, perhaps more so than\nmodern day people). This can have implications on the swiftness of our spiritual progress. So consider\nourselves to be extremely fortunate.\nMore people are now able to read up and get connected with spiritual resources and fellowships with the\nhelp of an open internet which brings entire libraries of information to their fingertips. This is certainly\nnot a replacement for a face-to-face spiritual community or teacher which always remains important and\nmost valuable, but at least more people are becoming aware and have a huge resource available to their\naid and have more directions. And it is with the aid of technology, the spread of information through\nonline media, and the support of online communities like the Awakening to Reality Discussion Group\n(note: this group is now closed, however you can join to access the old discussions. It is a treasure\ntrove of information.) that enables so many people from across the world to awaken.\nMay the growing awareness of this potentiality - the innate potentiality to awaken to our true nature,\nspread like wildfire in time to come for the benefit of all sentient beings. And may technology continue to\nevolve and become an even greater aid for our spiritual advancements.\nAs for going to sanghas - I have taken refuge in the triple gems (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) under a\nChinese Mahayana master Venerable Shen Kai from the Linji Ch’an lineage who was into awareness\nteachings and conversed with the teachers of that lineage, and also while studying in Australia at the\nUniversity of Queensland (graduated with Master of Computer Science) I frequent a Soto Zen center. I am\ngrateful and have learned much from both lineages, and both lineages contributed to and aided my\nprogress and understanding at the appropriate time, although in my latter phase I would say that in\ncertain ways I resonated more with the Soto Zen teacher Peter (Genjo) Bruza of Open Way Zen\n18\nA Little Background Information\nhttps://www.openway.org.au/ as he was often expressing what I call anatta and total exertion, and the\nSoto Zen teacher likewise seemed to resonate with my insights when I shared about them with him. But I\nhave had some interesting conversations with the Zen master in the 2 years that I was in Australia\nbetween 2013 and 2015. However later on in 2022 I have come to find out that the local (Singaporean)\ndharma teacher in Ren Cheng Buddhism (the lineage of Venerable Shen Kai)\nhttp://www.jenchenblissculture.com/ Li Zhu Lao Shi 丽珠老师 seem to have underwent quite similar\nphases as me (such as I AM to nondual to anatta) after hours long conversations. Although she is a\nlineage holder in the same tradition as from Master Shen Kai that traces back to Zen Master Dongchu in\nthe lineage of Zen Master Linji, she also reiterated that Ren Cheng Buddhism teaching is distinct from\ntraditional Ch'an Buddhism in some crucial ways. After I told her about my involvement in AtR, she\nencouraged me to continue teaching and \"being their teacher\", although I never saw myself as a teacher. I\ndo however advise people to find an awakened teacher\n(https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/01/finding-awakened-spiritual-teacher-and.html ,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/02/teachers-who-realised-anatta.html). There were a number\nof other Zen, Dzogchen, and Theravada teachers that I have conversed with and learnt things from but\nnot mentioned here. Recently (2020~2022) John Tan and I have received Dzogchen teachings from Acarya\nMalcolm Smith of the Zangthal Sangha http://www.zangthal.com/, and we find his teachings very\nresonating too. for malcolm teachings you can register at http://www.zangthal.com/registration . Never\nhad the chance to attend Mahamudra teachings yet (which is another teaching I like), perhaps in the\nfuture I will.\nBut yes, the biggest influence for triggering my insights was from my interactions with John Tan since\n2004. A short description of John Tan from Soh’s e-journal: “I am in the finance and investment industries\nserving as independent/non-executive directors (sort of watchdog) for some listed companies in\nSingapore. As for practice, I was initially under the guidance of a Taoist teacher (Gao Shang Tze) in Taiwan\nbut later took my refuge under the Holiness Sakya Trizin. However in actual case, I am a lay practitioner\nand a non-sectarian. I had my experience of no-dog aka \"I AM\" at the age of 17 and after the next 25\nyears is just its unfolding from non-dual to spontaneous perfection.” - John Tan, post on Dharma\nOverground v1, 2009\nUpdate 2020~2022: John Tan and I started to attend Acarya Malcolm’s Dzogchen teachings online. John\nTan and I found Acarya Malcolm’s teachings resonating. Acarya Malcolm teaches that in Dzogchen one\ngoes through initial rigpa of recognizing unfabricated clarity (like I AM realization in AtR lingo) before\nanatta/emptiness. You can read about some of his writings at\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2014/02/clarifications-on-dharmakaya-and-basis_16.html\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/06/choosing.html,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/09/the-degrees-of-rigpa.html etc. You can check out future\nteachings at www.zangthal.com\n19\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of\nEnlightenment\nThusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html\n(Soh: This article was written by my teacher who goes by the online moniker \"Thusness\"/\"PasserBy\" [John\nTan]. I have personally gone through these phases of realizations myself since then.)\nFor Chinese version, see Chinese Translation of Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment\n( http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/p/chinese-translation-of.html ) - offers to improve this\ntranslation or help out in other translation works will be much appreciated.\nNOTE: The stages are nothing authoritative, merely for sharing purposes. The article On Anatta (No-Self),\nEmptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection is a good reference for these 7 phases of\nexperience. The original six stages of experience has been updated to seven stages of experience, with the\naddition of 'Stage 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected' for readers to understand that seeing the nature\nof reality as the ground of all experiences which is Always So, is important for effortlessness to take place.\nBased on:\nhttp://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&thread_id=210722&page=3\nComments below are by John unless explicitly stated to be from Soh.\n(First written: 20th September 2006, Last Updated by John: 27th August 2012, Last Updated by Soh: 22nd\nJanuary 2019)\nStage 1: The Experience of “I AM”\nIt was about 20 years back and it all started with the question of “Before birth, who am I?” I do not know\nwhy but this question seemed to capture my entire being. I could spend days and nights just sitting focusing,\npondering over this question; till one day, everything seemed to come to a complete standstill, not even a\nsingle thread of thought arose. There was merely nothing and completely void, only this pure sense of\nexistence. This mere sense of I, this Presence, what was it? It was not the body, not thought as there was\nno thought, nothing at all, just Existence itself. There was no need for anyone to authenticate this\nunderstanding.\n20\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nAt that moment of realization, I experienced a tremendous flow of energy being released. It was as if life\nwas expressing itself through my body and I was nothing but this expression. However at that point in time,\nI was still unable to fully understand what this experience was and how I had misunderstood its nature.\nComments by Soh: This is also the First Stage of the Five Ranks of Tozan Ryokai (a Zen Buddhism map of\nawakening), called \"The Apparent within the Real\". This phase can also be described as an oceanic Ground of\nBeing or Source devoid of the sense of individuality/personal self, described here by John in 2006:\n\"Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into nothingness. When a practitioner becomes\nthoroughly clear about the illusory nature of the individuality, subject-object division does not take place.\nA person experiencing “AMness” will find “AMness in everything”. What is it like?\nBeing freed from individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all phenomenon merely pop in and out\nfrom the background of the AMness. The AMness is not experienced as an ‘entity’ residing anywhere,\nneither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take place.\nEven in the moment of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing\nthe ‘Real’ as clear as it can be. We cannot lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-\nemerges from it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going. This \"AMness\" is God.\nPractitioners should never mistake this as the true Buddha Mind! \"I AMness\" is the pristine awareness. That\nis why it is so overwhelming. Just that there is no 'insight' into its emptiness nature.\" (Excerpt from Buddha\nNature is NOT \"I Am\")\nSoh: To realize I AM, the most direct method is Self-Inquiry, asking yourself 'Who am I?' See: The Direct Path to\nYour Real Self, self-inquiry chapter in Awakening to Reality: A Guide to the Nature of Mind and my free e-book,\nand other self-inquiry book recommendations in Book Recommendations 2019 and Practice Advices or these\nyoutube videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCrWn_NueUg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783GbeforeKbzGY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymvj01q44o0\nhttps://youtu.be/BA8tDzK_kPI\nDo note that very often, one is having glimpses and experiences of I AM or vivid spaciousness or some\nrecognition of being an observer, but all these are not the I AM Realization of Thusness Stage 1, nor is Stage 1\nrealization merely a state of clarity. Self-Inquiry will lead to doubtless realization. I had glimpses of I AM on and\noff for three years before my doubtless Self-Realization in February 2010 which I wrote in my first journal entry\nof my free e-book. On the differences, see I AM Experience/Glimpse/Recognition vs I AM Realization (Certainty of\nBeing) and the first point in Realization and Experience and Non-Dual Experience from Different Perspectives\nFor further progress after I AM realization, focus on Four Aspects of I AM, contemplating the two stanzas of\n21\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nanatta in On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection and Two Types\nof Nondual Contemplation\nMany people I know (including Thusness himself) were/are stuck at Phase 1~3 for decades or their whole life\nwithout much progress due to lack of clear pointers and guidance, but by following Thusness's advice on the\nfour aspects and contemplation on anatta (no-self), I was able to progress from Phase 1 realization to Phase 5\nin less than a year, back in 2010.\nStage 2: The Experience of “I AM Everything”\nIt seemed that my experience was supported by many Advaita and Hindu teachings. But the biggest mistake\nI made was when I spoke to a Buddhist friend. He told me about the doctrine of no-self, about no ‘I’. I\nrejected such doctrine outright as it was in direct contradiction with what I had experienced. I was deeply\nconfused for some time and could not appreciate why Buddha had taught this doctrine and worse still,\nmake it a Dharma Seal. Until one day, I experienced the fusing of everything into ‘Me’ but somehow there\nwas no ‘me’. It was like an “I-less I’. I somehow accepted the 'no I' idea but then I still insisted that Buddha\nshouldn't have put it that way...\nThe experience was wonderful, it was as if I was totally emancipated, a complete release without boundary.\nI told myself, “I am totally convinced that I am no longer confused”, so I wrote a poem (something like the\nbelow),\nI am the rain\nI am the sky\nI am the ‘blueness’\nThe color of the sky\nNothing is more real than the I\nTherefore Buddha, I am I.\nThere is a phrase for this experience -- Whenever and wherever there IS, the IS is Me. This phrase was like\na mantra to me. I often used this to lead me back into the experience of Presence.\nThe rest of the journey was the unfolding and further refining of this experience of Total Presence, but\nsomehow there was always this blockage, this ‘something’ preventing me from recapturing the experience.\nIt was the inability to fully ‘die’ into total Presence..\nComments by Soh: The following excerpt should clarify about this phase:\n22\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\n“It is bringing this I AM into everything. I AM the I in you. The I in the cat, the I in the bird. I AM the first person in\neveryone and Everything. I. That is my second phase. That the I is ultimate and universal.” - John Tan, 2013\nStage 3: Entering Into a State of Nothingness\nSomehow something was blocking the natural flow of my innermost essence and preventing me from re-\nliving the experience. Presence was still there but there was no sense of ‘totality’. It was both logically and\nintuitively clear that ‘I’ was the problem. It was the ‘I’ that was blocking; it was the ‘I’ that was the limit; it was\nthe ‘I’ that was the boundary but why couldn’t I do away with it? At that point in time it didn’t occur to me\nthat I should look into the nature of awareness and what awareness is all about. Instead, I was too occupied\nwith the art of entering into a state of oblivion to get rid of the ‘I’... This continued for the next 13+ years (in\nbetween of course there were many other minor events and the experience of total presence did occur\nmany times, but with gaps a few months long)…\nHowever I came to one important understanding –\nThe ‘I’ is the root cause of all artificialities, true freedom is in spontaneity. Surrender into complete\nnothingness and everything is simply Self So.\nComments by Soh:\nHere's something John wrote to me about Stage 3 while I was having some glimpses of Stage 1 and 2 in 2008,\n\"Associating 'death of I' with vivid luminosity of your experience is far too early. This will lead you into\nerroneous views because there is also the experience of practitioners by way of complete surrendering or\nelimination (dropping) like Taoist practitioners. An experience of deep bliss that is beyond that of what you\nexperienced can occur. But the focus is not on luminosity but effortlessness, naturalness and spontaneity.\nIn complete giving up, there is no 'I' ; it is also needless to know anything; in fact 'knowledge' is considered\na stumbling block. The practitioner drops away mind, body, knowledge...everything. There is no insight,\nthere is no luminosity there is only total allowing of whatever that happens, happen in its own accord. All\nsenses including consciousness are shut and fully absorbed. Awareness of 'anything' is only after emerging\nfrom that state.\nOne is the experience of vivid luminosity while the other is a state of oblivious. It is therefore not\nappropriate to relate the complete dissolving of 'I' with what you experienced alone.\"\nAlso see this article for comments on Stage 3: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/03/thusnesss-\ncomments-on-nisargadatta.html\n23\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nHowever, it is only at John Tan/Thusness Stage 4 and 5 that one realizes that the effortless and natural way to\ngive up self/Self is through the realization and actualization of anatta as an insight, not through entering a special\nor altered state of trance, samadhi, absorption or oblivion. As John wrote before,\n\"...it seems that lots of effort need to be put in -- which is really not the case. The entire practice turns out\nto an undoing process. It is a process of gradually understanding the workings of our nature that is from\nbeginning liberated but clouded by this sense of ‘self’ that is always trying to preserve, protect and ever\nattached. The entire sense of self is a ‘doing’. Whatever we do, positive or negative, is still doing. Ultimately\nthere is not-even a letting go or let be, as there is already continuous dissolving and arising and this ever\ndissolving and arising turns out to be self-liberating. Without this ‘self’ or ‘Self’, there is no ‘doing’, there is\nonly spontaneous arising. \"\n~ John (source: Non-dual and karmic patterns)\n\"...When one is unable to see the truth of our nature, all letting go is nothing more than another from of\nholding in disguise. Therefore without the 'insight', there is no releasing.... it is a gradual process of deeper\nseeing. when it is seen, the letting go is natural. You cannot force yourself into giving up the self...\npurification to me is always these insights... non-dual and emptiness nature....\"\nStage 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nI got in touch with Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find out more about the experience of\n‘Presence’ but rather the teaching of impermanence synced deeply with what I was experiencing in life. I\nwas faced with the possibility of losing all my wealth and more by financial crisis. At that point in time I had\nno idea that Buddhism is so profoundly rich on the aspect of ‘Presence’. The mystery of life cannot be\nunderstood, I sought for a refuge in Buddhism (comments by Soh: he took refuge in the triple gems Buddha,\nDharma and Sangha under the 41st H.H. Sakya Trizin) to alleviate my sorrows caused by the financial crisis,\nbut it turned out to be the missing key towards experiencing total presence.\nI wasn’t that resistant then to the doctrine of ‘no-self’ but the idea that all phenomenal existence is empty\nof an inherent ‘self’ or ‘Self’ did not quite get into me. Were they talking about the ‘self’ as a personality or\n‘Self’ as ‘Eternal Witness’? Must we do away even with the ‘Witness’? Was the Witness itself another illusion?\nThere is thinking, no thinker\nThere is sound, no hearer\nSuffering exists, no sufferer\nDeeds there are, no doer\n24\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nI was meditating on the meaning of the above stanza deeply until one day, suddenly I heard ‘tongss…’, it\nwas so clear, there was nothing else, just the sound and nothing else! And ‘tongs…’ resounding… It was so\nclear, so vivid!\nThat experience was so familiar, so real and so clear. It was the same experience of “I AM”… it was without\nthought, without concepts, without intermediary, without anyone there, without any in-between… What\nwas it? IT was Presence! But this time it was not ‘I AM’, it was not asking ‘who am I’, it was not the pure sense\nof “I AM”, it was ‘TONGSss….’, the pure Sound…\nThen came Taste, just the Taste and nothing else….\nThe heart beats…\nThe Scenery…\nThere was no gap in between, no longer a few months gap for it to arise…\nThere never was a stage to enter, no I to cease and never had it existed\nThere is no entry and exit point…\nThere is no Sound out there or in here…\nThere is no ‘I’ apart from the arising and ceasing…\nThe manifold of Presence…\nMoment to moment Presence unfolds…\nComments:\nThis is the beginning of seeing through no-self. Insight into no-self has arisen but non-dual experience is\nstill very much 'Brahman' rather than 'Sunyata'; in fact it is more Brahman than ever. Now \"I AMness\" is\nexperienced in All.\nNevertheless it is a very important key phase where the practitioner experiences a quantum leap in\nperception untying the dualistic knot. This is also the key insight leading to the realization that \"All is Mind\",\nall is just this One Reality.\nThe tendency to extrapolate an Ultimate Reality or Universal Consciousness where we are part of this\nReality remains surprisingly strong. Effectively the dualistic knot is gone but the bond of seeing things\ninherently isn't. 'Dualistic' and 'inherent' knots that prevent the full experiencing of our Maha, empty and\nnon-dual nature of pristine awareness are two very different 'perceptual spells' that blind.\nThe subsection \"On Second Stanza\" of the post \"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness,\nand Spontaneous Perfection\" further elaborates this insight.\nComments by Soh:\n25\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nThe beginning of non-dual realization and the gateless gate without entry and exit. One no longer seeks after a\nstate of oblivion to get rid of self as in the case of Stage 3 but starts to realize and actualize the always-already-\nso of no-self and non-dual nature of Awareness. Still, Stage 4 tends to end up in the case of dissolving separateness\ninto the pole of an ultimate pure subjectivity rather than seeing consciousness as the mere flow of phenomenality\nas in Stage 5, thus leaving traces of an Absolute.\nJohn wrote in 2005:\n\"Without 'self' oneness is immediately attained. There is only and always this Isness. Subject has always\nbeen the Object of observation. This is true samadhi without entering trance. Completely understanding\nthis truth. It is the true way towards liberation. Every sound, sensation, arising of consciousness is so clear,\nreal and vivid. Every moment is samadhi. The tip of the fingers in contact with the keyboard, mysteriously\ncreated the contact consciousness, what is it? Feel the entirety of beingness and realness. There is no\nsubject... just Isness. No thought, there really is no thought and no 'self'. Only Pure Awareness.\", \"How could\nanyone understand? The crying, the sound, the noise is buddha. It is all the experience of Thusness. To\nknow the true meaning of this, Hold not even the slightest trace of 'I'. In the most natural state of ILessNess,\nAll Is. Even if one said the same statement, the depth of experience differs. The is no point convincing\nanyone. Can anyone understand? Any form of rejection, Any sort of division Is to reject buddhahood. If\nthere is a slightest sense of a subject, an experiencer, we miss the point. Natural Awareness is subjectless.\nThe vividness and clarity. Feel, taste, see and hear with totality. There is always no 'I'. Thank you Buddha,\nYou truly know. :)\"\nStage 5: No Mirror Reflecting\nThere is no mirror reflecting\nAll along manifestation alone is.\nThe one hand claps\nEverything IS!\nEffectively Phase 4 is merely the experience of non-division between subject/object. The initial insight\nglimpsed from the anatta stanza is without self but in the later phase of my progress it appeared more like\nsubject/object as an inseparable union, rather than absolutely no-subject. This is precisely the 2nd case of\nthe Three levels of understanding Non-Dual. I was still awed by the pristineness and vividness of\nphenomena in phase 4.\nPhase 5 is quite thorough in being no one and I would call this anatta in all 3 aspects -- no subject/object\ndivision, no doer-ship and absence of agent.\nThe trigger point here is the direct and thorough seeing that 'the mirror is nothing more than an arising\nthought'. With this, the solidity and all the grandeur of 'Brahman' goes down the drain. Yet it feels perfectly\n26\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nright and liberating without the agent and being simply as an arising thought or as a vivid moment of a bell\nresounding. All the vividness and presence remains, with an additional sense of freedom. Here a\nmirror/reflection union is clearly understood as flawed, there is only vivid reflection. There cannot be a\n'union' if there isn't a subject to begin with. It is only in subtle recalling, that is in a thought recalling a\nprevious moment of thought, that the watcher seems to exist. From here, I moved towards the 3rd degree\nof non-dual.\nThe Stanza One complements and refines Stanza Two to make the experience of no-self thorough and\neffortless into just only chirping birds, drum beats, footsteps, sky, mountain, walking, chewing and tasting;\nno witness whatsoever hiding anywhere! 'Everything' is a process, event, manifestation and phenomenon,\nnothing ontological or having an essence.\nThis phase is a very thorough non-dual experience; there is effortlessness in the non-dual and one realizes\nthat in seeing there is always just scenery and in hearing, always just sounds. We find true delights in\nnaturalness and ordinariness as commonly expressed in Zen as 'chop wood, carry water; spring comes,\ngrass grows'. With regards to ordinariness (see \"On Maha in Ordinariness\"), this must also be correctly\nunderstood. A recent conversation with Simpo summarizes what I am trying to convey with regards to\nordinariness. Simpo (Longchen) is a very insightful and sincere practitioner, there are some very good\nquality articles written by him regarding non-duality in his website Dreamdatum.\nYes Simpo,\nNon-dual is ordinary as there is no 'beyond' stage to arrive at. It appears to be extraordinary and grandeur\nonly as an afterthought due to comparison.\nThat said, the maha experience appearing as \"universe chewing\" and the spontaneity of pristine happening\nmust still remain maha, free, boundless and clear. For that is what it is and cannot be otherwise. The\n\"extraordinariness and grandeur\" that result from comparison must also be correctly discerned from the\n'what is' of non-dual.\nWhenever contraction steps in, it is already a manifestation of 'experiencer-experience split'.\nConventionally speaking, that being the cause, that is the effect. Whatever the condition is, be it the result\nof unfavorable situations or subtle recalling to arrive at a certain good sensation or attempting to fix an\nimaginary split, we have to treat it that the 'non-dual' insight has not pervaded into our entire being like the\nway 'karmic tendency to divide' does. We have not fearlessly, openly and unreservedly welcomed whatever\nis. :-)\nJust my view, a casual sharing.\n27\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nPractitioners up to this level often get over excited believing that this phase is final; in fact it does appear\nto be a sort of pseudo finality. But this is a misunderstanding. Nothing much can be said. The practitioner\nwill also be naturally led into spontaneous perfection without going further in emptying the aggregates. :-)\nFor further comments: http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/210722?page=6\nComments:\nThe drop is thorough, the center is gone. The center is nothing more than a subtle karmic tendency to\ndivide. A more poetic expression would be “sound hears, scenery sees, the dust is the mirror.” Transient\nphenomena themselves have always been the mirror; only a strong dualistic view prevents the seeing.\nVery often cycles after cycles of refining our insights are needed to make the non-dual less 'concentrative'\nand more 'effortless'. This relates to experiencing the non-solidity and spontaneity of experience. The\nsubsection \"On First Stanza\" of the post \"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and\nSpontaneous Perfection\" further elaborates this phase of insight.\nAt this phase, we must be clear that emptying the subject will only result in non-duality and there is a need\nto further empty the aggregates, 18 dhatus. This means one must further penetrate the emptiness nature\nof the 5 aggregates, 18 dhatus with dependent origination and emptiness. The need to reify a Universal\nBrahman is understood as the karmic tendency to 'solidify' experiences. This leads to the understanding of\nthe empty nature of non-dual presence.\nStage 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty\nPhase 4 and 5 are the grayscale of seeing through the subject that it does not exist in actuality (anatta),\nthere are only the aggregates. However even the aggregates are empty (Heart Sutra). It may sound obvious\nbut more often than not, even a practitioner who has matured the anatta experience (as in phase 5) will\nmiss the essence of it.\nAs I have said earlier, phase 5 does appear to be final and it is pointless to emphasize anything. Whether\none proceeds further to explore this empty nature of Presence and move into the Maha world of suchness\nwill depend on our conditions.\nAt this juncture, it is necessary to have clarity on what Emptiness is not to prevent misunderstandings:\n• Emptiness is not a substance\n• Emptiness is not a substratum or background\n• Emptiness is not light\n• Emptiness is not consciousness or awareness\n28\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\n• Emptiness is not the Absolute\n• Emptiness does not exist on its own\n• Objects do not consist of emptiness\n• Objects do not arise from emptiness\n• Emptiness of the \"I\" does not negate the \"I\"\n• Emptiness is not the feeling that results when no objects are appearing to the mind\n• Meditating on emptiness does not consist of quieting the mind\nSource: Non-Dual Emptiness Teaching\nAnd I would like to add,\nEmptiness is not a path of practice\nEmptiness is not a form of fruition\n1Emptiness is the 'nature' of all experiences. There is nothing to attain or practice. What we have to realize\nis this empty nature, this ‘ungraspability’, ‘unlocatability ’ and ‘interconnectedness’ nature of all vivid arising.\nEmptiness will reveal that not only is there no ‘who’ in pristine awareness, there is no ‘where’ and ‘when’.\nBe it ‘I’, ‘Here’ or ’Now’, all are simply impressions that dependently originate in accordance with the\nprinciple of conditionality.\nWhen there is this, that is.\nWith the arising of this, that arises.\nWhen this is not, neither is that.\nWith the cessation of this, that ceases.\nThe profundity of this four-liner principle of conditionality is not in words. For a more theoretical exposition,\nsee Non-Dual Emptiness Teachings by Dr. Greg Goode; for a more experiential narration, see the\nsubsection \"On Emptiness\" and \"On Maha\" of the post \"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and\nOrdinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\".\nComments:\nHere practice is clearly understood as neither going after the mirror nor escaping from the maya reflection;\nit is to thoroughly 'see' the 'nature' of reflection. To see that there is really no mirror other than the on-\ngoing reflection due to our emptiness nature. Neither is there a mirror to cling to as the background reality\nnor a maya to escape from. Beyond these two extreme lies the middle path -- the prajna wisdom of seeing\nthat the maya is our Buddha nature.\nRecently An Eternal Now has updated some very high quality articles that better described the maha\nexperience of suchness. Do read the following articles:\n29\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\n- Emancipation of Suchness\n- Buddha-Dharma: A Dream in a Dream\nThe last 3 subsections (\"On Emptiness\", \"On Maha in Ordinariness\", \"Spontaneous Perfection\") of the post\n\"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\" elaborates this\nphase of emptiness insight and the gradual progress of maturing the experience into the effortless mode\nof practice. It is important to know that in addition to the experience of the unfindability and ungraspability\nof emptiness, the interconnectedness of everything creating the Maha experience is equally precious.\nStage 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nAfter cycles and cycles of refining our practice and insights, we will come to this realization:\nAnatta is a seal, not a stage.\nAwareness has always been non-dual.\nAppearances have always been Non-arising.\nAll phenomena are ‘interconnected’ and by nature Maha.\nAll are always and already so. Only dualistic and inherent views are obscuring these experiential facts and\ntherefore what is really needed is simply to experience whatever arises openly and unreservedly (See\nsection \"On Spontaneous Perfection\"). However this does not denote the end of practice; practice simply\nmoves to become dynamic and conditions-manifestation based. The ground and the path of practice\nbecome indistinguishable.\nComments:\nThe entire article of On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\ncan be seen as the different approaches toward the eventual realization of this already perfect and\nuncontrived nature of awareness.\nOn Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and\nSpontaneous Perfection\nAlso see:\n+A and -A Emptiness\n30\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\n(Last Updated: 14th March 2009)\nArticle written by: John Tan\nWonder why but of late, the topic on anatta kept surfacing in forums. Perhaps 'yuan' (condition) has\narisen. -:) I will just jot down some thoughts on my experiences of ‘no-self’. A casual sharing, nothing\nauthoritative.\nThe 2 stanzas below are pivotal in leading me to the direct experience of no-self. Although they appear to\nconvey the same stuff about anatta, meditating on these 2 stanzas can yield 2 very different experiential\ninsights -- one on the emptiness aspect and the other, the non-dual luminosity aspect. The insights that\narise from these experiences are very illuminating as they contradict so much our ordinary understanding\nof what awareness is.\nThere is thinking, no thinker\nThere is hearing, no hearer\nThere is seeing, no seer\nIn thinking, just thoughts\nIn hearing, just sounds\nIn seeing, just forms, shapes and colors.\nBefore proceeding any further, it is of absolute importance to know that there is no way the stanzas can\nbe correctly understood by way of inference, logical deduction or induction. Not that there is something\nmystical or transcendental about the stanzas but simply the way of mental chattering is a 'wrong\napproach'. The right technique is through 'vipassana' or any more direct and attentive bare mode of\nobservation that allows the seeing of things as they are. Just a casual note, such mode of knowing turns\nnatural when non-dual insight matures, before that it can be quite 'efforting'.\nOn the first stanza\nThe two most obvious experiences from this initial glimpse of the first stanza is the lack of doer-ship and\nthe direct insight of the absence of an agent. These 2 experiences are key for my phase 5 of the 7 phases\nof insights.\n1. The lack of doer-ship that links and co-ordinates experiences.\nWithout the 'I' that links, phenomena (thoughts, sound, feelings and so on and so forth) appear bubble-\nlike, floating and manifesting freely, spontaneously and boundlessly. With the absence of the doer-ship\nalso comes a deep sense of freedom and transparency. Ironical as it may sound but it's true\n31\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nexperientially. We will not have the right understanding when we hold too tightly 'inherent' view. It is\namazing how 'inherent' view prevents us from seeing freedom as no-doership, interdependence and\ninterconnectedness, luminosity and non-dual presence.\n2. The direct insight of the absence of an agent.\nIn this case, there is a direct recognition that there is “no agent”. Just one thought then another thought.\nSo it is always thought watching thought rather than a watcher watching thought. However the gist of this\nrealization is skewed towards a spontaneous liberating experience and a vague glimpse of the empty\nnature of phenomena -- that is, the transient phenomena being bubble-like and ephemeral, nothing\nsubstantial or solid. At this phase we should not misunderstand that we have experienced thoroughly the\n‘empty’ nature of phenomena and awareness, although there is this temptation to think we have. -:)\nDepending on the conditions of an individual, it may not be obvious that it is “always thought watching\nthought rather than a watcher watching thought.” or \"the watcher is that thought.\" Because this is the key\ninsight and a step that cannot afford to be wrong along the path of liberation, I cannot help but with\nsome disrespectful tone say,\nFor those masters that taught,\n“Let thoughts arise and subside,\nSee the background mirror as perfect and be unaffected.”\nWith all due respect, they have just “blah” something nice but deluded.\nRather,\nSee that there is no one behind thoughts.\nFirst, one thought then another thought.\nWith deepening insight it will later be revealed,\nAlways just this, One Thought!\nNon-arising, luminous yet empty!\nAnd this is the whole purpose of anatta. To thoroughly see through that this background does not exist in\nactuality. What exists is a stream, action or karma. There is no doer or anything being done, there is only\ndoing; No meditator nor meditation, only meditating. From a letting go perspective, \"a watcher watching\nthought\" will create the impression that a watcher is allowing thoughts to arise and subside while itself\nbeing unaffected. This is an illusion; it is 'holding' in disguise as 'letting go'. When we realized that there is\nno background from start, reality will present itself as one whole letting go. With practice, ‘intention’\ndwindles with the maturing of insight and ‘doing’ will be gradually experienced as mere spontaneous\nhappening as if universe is doing the work. With the some pointers from 'dependent origination', we can\nthen penetrate further to see this happening as a sheer expression of everything interacting with\n32\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\neverything coming into being. In fact, if we do not reify ‘universe’, it is just that -- an expression of\ninterdependent arising that is just right wherever and whenever is.\nUnderstanding this, practice is simply opening to whatever is.\nFor this mere happening is just right wherever and whenever is.\nThough no place can be called home it is everywhere home.\nWhen experience matures in the practice of great ease,\nThe experience is Maha! Great, miraculous and bliss.\nIn mundane activities of seeing, eating and tasting,\nWhen expressed poetically is as if the entire universe meditating.\nWhatever said and expressed are really all different flavors,\nOf this everything of everything dependently originating,\nAs this moment of vivid shimmering.\nBy then it is clear that the transient phenomena is already happening in the perfect way; unwinding what\nmust be unwinded, manifesting what must be manifested and subsides when it is time to go. There is no\nproblem with this transient happening, the only problem is having an ‘extra mirror’, a reification due to\nthe power of the mind to abstract. The mirror is not perfect; it is the happening that is perfect. The mirror\nappears to be perfect only to a dualistic and inherent view.\nOur deeply held inherent and dualistic view has very subtly and unknowingly personified the \"luminous\naspect\" into the watcher and discarded the \"emptiness aspect\" as the transient phenomena. The key\nchallenge of practice is then to clearly see that luminosity and emptiness are one and inseparable, they\nhave never and can never be separated.\nOn the second stanza\nFor the second stanza, the focus is on the vivid, pristine-ness of transience phenomena. Thoughts, sounds\nand all transient are indistinguishable from Awareness. There is no-experiencer-experience split, only one\nseamless spontaneous experience arising as thinker/thoughts, hearer/sounds, feeler/feelings and so on.\nIn hearing, hearer and sound are indistinguishably one. For anyone that is familiar with the “I AM”\nexperience, that pure sense of existence, that powerful experience of presence that makes one feel so\nreal, is unforgettable. When the background is gone, all foreground phenomena reveal themselves as\nPresence. It is like naturally 'vipassanic' throughout or simply put, naked in awareness. From the hissing\nsound of PC, to the vibration of the moving MRT train, to the sensation when the feet touches the ground,\nall these experiences are crystal clear, no less “I AM” than “I AM”. The Presence is still fully present,\nnothing is denied. -:)\n33\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nDivision of subject and object is merely an assumption.\nThus someone giving up and something to be given up is an illusion.\nWhen self becomes more and more transparent,\nLikewise phenomena become more and more luminous.\nIn thorough transparency all happening are pristinely and vividly clear.\nObviousness throughout, aliveness everywhere!\nIt will be obvious by then that only the deeply held dualistic view is obscuring our insight into this\nexperiential fact. In actual experience, there is just the crystal clarity of phenomena manifesting. Maturing\nthis experience, the mind-body dissolves into mere non-dual luminosity and all phenomena are\nexperientially understood as the manifestation of this non-dual luminous presence -- the key insight\nleading to the realization that \"All is Mind\".\nAfter this, not to be too overwhelmed or over-claimed what is more than necessary; rather investigate\nfurther. Does this non-dual luminosity exhibits any characteristic of self-nature that is independent,\nunchanging and permanent? A practitioner can still get stuck for quite sometimes solidifying non-dual\npresence unknowingly. This is leaving marks of the 'One mirror' as described in the stage 4 of the 7\nphases of my insights. Although experience is non-dual, the insight of emptiness is still not there. Though\nthe dualistic bond has loosened sufficiently, the 'inherent' view remains strong.\nWhen the 'subject' is gone, experience becomes non-dual but we forgotten about the 'object'. When\nobject is further emptied, we see Dharmakaya. Do See clearly that for the case of a ‘subject’ that is first\npenetrated, it is a mere label collating the 5 aggregates but for the next level that is to be negated, it is the\nPresence that we are emptying -- not a label but the very presence itself that is non-dual in nature.\nFor sincere Buddhist practitioners that have matured non-dual insight, they may prompt themselves why\nis there a need for Buddha to put so much emphasis on dependent origination if non-dual presence is\nfinal? The experience is still as Vedantic, more 'Brahman' than 'Sunyata'. This 'solidity of non-dual\npresence' must be broken with the help of dependent origination and emptiness. Knowing this a\npractitioner can then progress to understand the empty (dependently originated) nature of non-dual\npresence. It is a further refining of anatta experience according to the first stanza.\nAs for those \"I AMness\" practitioners, it is very common for them after non-dual insight to stay in non-\ndual presence. They find delight in 'chop wood, carry water' and 'spring comes, grass grows by its own'.\nNothing much can be stressed; the experience do appear to be final. Hopefully 'yuan' (condition) can arise\nfor these practitioners to see this subtle mark that prevent the seeing.\nOn Emptiness\n34\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nIf we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it arise, what is ‘thought’ like.\n'Thought' will reveal its nature is empty -- vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very important\nnot to infer, think or conceptualise but feel with our entire being this ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It\nseems to reside 'somewhere' but there is no way to locate it. It is just an impression of somewhere\n\"there\" but never \"there\". Similarly “here-ness” and “now-ness” are merely impressions formed by\nsensations, aggregates of causes and conditions, nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like ‘selfness’.\nThis ungraspable and unlocatable empty nature is not only peculiar to ‘thought’. All experiences or\nsensations are like that -- vividly present yet insubstantial, un-graspable, spontaneous, un-locatable.\nIf we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front of us, the “redness” only appears\nto “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species (dogs\ncannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum\neyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found, only\nalmost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are\ndependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or\n“redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without inherent/objective existence.\nLikewise when standing in front of a burning fire pit, the entire phenomena of ‘fire’, the burning heat, the\nwhole sensation of ‘hotness’ that are so vividly present and seem so real but when examined they are\nalso not inherently “there” -- merely dependently manifest whenever conditions are there. It is amazing\nhow dualistic and inherent views have caged seamless experience in a who-where-when construct.\nAll experiences are empty. They are like sky flowers, like painting on the surface of a pond. There is no\nway to point to a moment of experience and say this is ‘in’ and that is ‘out’. All ‘in’ are as ‘out’; to\nawareness seamless experience is all there is. It is not the mirror or pond that is important but that\nprocess of illusion-like phenomenon of the paint shimmering on the surface of the pond; like an illusion\nbut not an illusion, like a dream but not a dream. This is the ground of all experiences.\nYet this ‘ungraspability and unlocatabilty’ nature is not all there is; there is also this Maha, this great\nwithout boundaries feeling of 'interconnectedness'. When someone hits a bell, the person, the stick, the\nbell, the vibration of the air, the ears and then the magically appearance of sound -- ’Tongsss…re-\nsounding…’ is all a seamless one happening, one experience. When breathing, it is just this one whole\nentire breath; it is all causes and conditions coming together to give rise to this entire sensation of breath\nas if the whole of universe is doing this breathing. The significance of this Maha experience is not in\nwords; in my opinion, without this experience, there is no true experience of 'interconnectedness' and\nnon-dual presence is incomplete.\nThe experience of our empty nature is a very different from that of non-dual oneness. ‘Distance’ for\nexample is overcome in non-dual oneness by seeing through the illusory aspect of subject/object division\n35\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nand resulted in a one non-dual presence. It is seeing all as just ‘This’ but experiencing Emptiness breaks\nthe boundary through its empty ungraspable and unlocatable nature.\nThere is no need for a ‘where-place' or a ‘when-time' or a ‘who-I' when we penetrate deeply into this\nnature. When hearing sound, sound is neither ‘in here’ nor ‘out there’, it is where it is and gone! All centers\nand reference points dissolve with the wisdom that manifestation dependently originates and hence\nempty. The experience creates an \"always right wherever and whenever is\" sensation. A sensation of\nhome everywhere though nowhere can be called home. Experiencing the emptiness nature of presence,\na sincere practitioner becomes clear that indeed the non-dual presence is leaving a subtle mark; seeing\nits nature as empty, the last mark that solidifies experiences dissolves. It feels cool because presence is\nmade more present and effortless. We then move from \"vivid non-dual presence\" into \"though vividly and\nnon-dually present, it is nothing real, empty!\".\nOn Maha and Ordinariness\nThe experience of Maha may sound as if one is going after certain sort of experience and appears to be in\ncontradiction with the 'ordinariness of enlightenment' promoted in Zen Buddhism. This is not true and in\nfact, without this experience, non-dual is incomplete. This section is not about Maha as a stage to achieve\nbut to see that Sunyata is Maha in nature. In Maha, one does not feel self, one 'feels' universe; one does\nnot feel 'Brahman' but feels 'interconnectedness'; one does not feel 'helplessness' due to 'dependence\nand interconnection' but feels great without boundary, spontaneous and marvelous. Now lets get back to\n'ordinariness'.\nOrdinariness has always been Taoism’s forte. In Zen we also see the importance of this being depicted in\nthose enlightenment models like Tozan’s 5 ranks and the The Ten Oxherding Pictures. But ordinariness\nmust only be understood that non-dual and the Maha world of suchness is nothing beyond. There is no\nbeyond realm to arrive at and never a separated state from our ordinary daily world; rather it is to bring\nthis primordial, original and untainted experience of non-dual and Maha experience into the most\nmundane activities. If this experience is not found in most mundane and ordinary activities then\npractitioners have not matured their understandings and practices.\nBefore Maha experience has always been rare occurrence in the natural state and was treated as a\npassing trend that comes and goes. Inducing the experience often involves concentration on repeatedly\ndoing some task for a short period of time for example,\nIf we were to breathe in and out, in and out…till there is simply this entire sensation of breath, just breath\nas all causes and conditions coming into this moment of manifestation.\n36\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nIf we were to focus on the sensation of stepping, the sensation of hardness, just the sensation of the\nhardness, till there is simply this entire sensation ‘hardness’ when the feet touches the ground, just this\n‘hardness’ as all causes and conditions coming into this moment of manifestation.\nIf we were to focus on hearing someone hitting a bell, the stick, the bell, the vibration of the air, the ears\nall coming together for this sensation of sound to arise, we will have Maha experience.\n...\nHowever ever since incorporating the teaching of dependent origination into non-dual presence, over the\nyears it has become more ‘accessible’ but never has this been understood as a ground state. There seems\nto be a predictable relationship of seeing interdependent arising and emptiness on the experience of\nnon-dual presence.\nA week ago, the clear experience of Maha dawned and became quite effortless and at the same time\nthere is a direct realization that it is also a natural state. In Sunyata, Maha is natural and must be fully\nfactored into the path of experiencing whatever arises. Nevertheless Maha as a ground state requires the\nmaturing of non-dual experience; we cannot feel entirely as the interconnectedness of everything coming\nspontaneously into being as this moment of vivid manifestation with a divided mind.\nThe universe is this arising thought.\nThe universe is this arising sound.\nJust this magnificent arising!\nIs Tao.\nHomage to all arising.\nOn Spontaneous Perfection\nLastly, when these 2 experiences inter-permeate, what is really needed is simply to experience whatever\narises openly and unreservedly. It may sound simple but do not underestimate this simple path; even\naeon lives of practices cannot touch the depth of its profundity.\nIn fact all the subsections -- “On Stanza One”, “On Stanza Two”, “On Emptiness”, there is already certain\nemphasis of the natural way. With regards to the natural way, I must say that spontaneous presence and\nexperiencing whatever arises openly, unreservedly and fearlessly is not the 'path' of any tradition or\nreligion -- Be it Zen, Mahamudra, Dzogchen, Advaita, Taoism or Buddhism. In fact the natural way is the\n'path' of Tao but Taoism cannot claim monopoly over the 'path' simply because it has a longer history. My\nexperience is that any sincere practitioner after maturing non-dual experiences will eventually come to\nthis automatically and naturally. It is like in the blood, there is no other way than the natural way.\n37\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nThat said, the natural and spontaneous way is often misrepresented. It should not be taken to mean that\nthere is no need to do anything or practice is unnecessary. Rather it is the deepest insight of a\npractitioner that after cycles and cycles of refining his insights on the aspect of anatta, emptiness and\ndependent origination, he suddenly realized that anatta is a seal and non-dual luminosity and emptiness\nhave always been ‘the ground’ of all experiences. Practice then shift from ‘concentrative’ to ‘effortless’\nmode and for this it requires the complete pervading of non-dual and emptiness insights into our entire\nbeing like how “dualistic and inherent views” has invaded consciousness.\nIn any case, care must be taken not to make our empty and luminous nature into a metaphysical essence.\nI will end with a comment I wrote in another blog Luminous Emptiness as it summarizes pretty well what I\nhave written.\nThe degree of “un-contrivance”,\nIs the degree of how unreserved and fearless we open to whatever is.\nFor whatever arises is mind, always seen, heard, tasted and experienced.\nWhat that is not seen, not heard and not experienced,\nIs our conceptual idea of what mind is.\nWhenever we objectify the “brilliance, the pristine-ness” into an entity that is formless,\nIt becomes an object of grasp that prevents the seeing of the “forms”,\nthe texture and the fabric of awareness.\nThe tendency to objectify is subtle,\nwe let go of 'selfness' yet unknowingly grasped ‘nowness’ and ‘hereness’.\nWhatever arises merely dependently originates, needless of who, where and when.\nAll experiences are equal, luminous yet empty of self-nature.\nThough empty it has not in anyway denied its vivid luminosity.\nLiberation is experiencing mind as it is.\nSelf-Liberation is the thorough insight that this liberation is always and already is;\nSpontaneously present, naturally perfected!\nPS:\nWe should not treat the insight of emptiness as 'higher' than that of non-dual luminosity. It is just\ndifferent insights dawning due to differing conditions. To some practitioners, the insight of our empty\nnature comes before non-dual luminosity.\nFor a more detailed conceptual understanding of Emptiness, do read the article \"Non-Dual Emptiness\" by\nDr. Greg Goode.\n38\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nDifferent Degress of No-Self: Non-Doership,\nNon-dual, Anatta, Total Exertion and Dealing\nwith Pitfalls\nDifferent Degrees of No-Self: Non-Doership, Non-dual, Anatta, Total Exertion and Dealing with Pitfalls\nAvailable Translations of Realization and Experience and Non-Dual Experience from Different\nPerspectives:\n简体中文版 (Simplified Chinese Version)\n繁體中文版 (Traditional Chinese Version)\nAlso see:\nThusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nDark Night of the Soul, Depersonalization, Dissociation, and Derealization\nSomeone wrote:\nAnatta\nQuestion\nHi friends.\nI have a question.\nFirst, I have to quickly give some back ground.\nSeveral years ago, I had a profound experience. It was as if a veil was removed and I suddenly saw that I\ndidn't exist. There were no Self or free will inside that could control this organism that is the body. I spent\nyears observing myself and others from this perspective. It was the first thing I thought of when I woke up\nin the morning and the last thing I thought of before falling to sleep, until I was empty.\nNobody around me saw the same thing or got mad if I talked about it. I started studying science to find\nsupport or evidence against my thoughts. It only confirmed that the world is fatalistic and way to complex\nto understand in each moment. This took me even further.\nSo, now my life has stopped and there is noone inside to care. Only some faint and weak emotional and\nmental reactions to whatever stimuli is put in front of my senses. No hopes, ambitions or goals. I don't\npay my bills or take care of myself. I mean, why should \"I\"?\nEventualy, 3-4 years ago, I came over some \"spiritual\" litterature that mentioned the buddhist doctrine of\nanatta and samsaric consciousness.\n39\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nWhat would a buddhist recommend to do in this situation? I mean, I will either end up dead or in prison\nsoon if nothing happens. I'm okay with that. I don't look forward to physical pain, though.\nIs there something worth doing? Is this the end of the \"path\"? To realise that I don't exist?\n...\nYou are right. It has been very imbalanced and unhealthy, and thus it became exhausting and eventually\na problem. But it has also been profound and beautiful experiences, despite the fear, doubt and lack of\nunderstanding for what happened. I am at a point where I need some guidence and practices on how to\ndo this properly and the right way, or at least a better and healthier way. So, I think I am open to\ncorrections and guidence. Thank you again.\n——\nMe/Soh replied:\nHi,\nu/krodha (Kyle Dixon) directed me to this post... I think I will share my 2 cents.\nThere are different degrees of self/Self. I can elaborate a lot of them -- you can find these elaborations on\nmy blog and (free) guide - https://app.box.com/s/157eqgiosuw6xqvs00ibdkmc0r3mu8jg\nBut in this post I will just summarise them.\nThere are three main degrees or aspects of self/Self and no-self/Self experience, although each of them\nhas different degrees of refinement in terms of insight + experience:\n1. no-self as 'non-doership'. You no longer feel like a doer or controller, all thoughts and actions are just\nhappening spontaneously on its own accord. You see that even your thoughts and emotions are not from\na doer, you can't even know what your next moment of thought is, it just happens. When you are thirsty,\nthe hand just grabs the drink on its own accord and the body just gulps down the drink.\nA more refined level of non-doership is what I call 'impersonality'. Impersonality is not just an experience\nof non-doership. It is the dissolving of the construct of 'personal self' that led to a purging of ego effect to\na state of clean, pure, not-mine sort of \"perception shift\", accompanied with a sense that everything and\neveryone is being expressions of the same aliveness/intelligence/consciousness. This can then be easily\nextrapolated into a sense of a 'universal source' (but this is merely an extrapolation and at a later phase is\ndeconstructed) and one will also experience 'being lived' by this greater Life and Intelligence.\nImpersonality will help dissolve the sense of self but it has the danger of making one attached to a\nmetaphysical essence or to personify, reify and extrapolate a universal consciousness. Deeper insights\ninto anatta and emptiness will dissolve this tendency to reify and extrapolate.\nAlso, I should also mention that there is another insight or realization -- and this is not the same as non-\ndoership but rather the realization of one's luminous essence as Pure Presence and Clarity. Someone\nwho has experienced non-doership does not necessarily realize that one's very Beingness, Presence-\nAwareness, that I AMness -- that remains even without engaging in concepts/thinking. It is when at a\nmoment where all engagement in thoughts subside, in that gap, there is this sudden realization of\n40\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\ndoubtless Existence itself, that even without a thought, just I/Existence/Consciousness. And you realize\nthat is the Luminous core of Existence itself. It is consciousness, pure beingness and bliss. This realization\nis often reified into the Atman but I consider this realization precious and important and a progression\nfrom mere non-doership, but on later realizations below will get refined, especially with realization of\nanatta. Realization of anatta in point 3) sees the nature of this Presence-Awareness, not by denying it but\nproperly comprehending it - its non-inherent, empty and non-dual nature of that Presence-Awareness\n(also its nondual aspect does not imply realizing its empty nature, but I will not elaborate too much yet).\nBut basically if you have this realization, you will not end up sounding so nihilistic because you have\ndiscovered a very positive luminous core of Existence. Also, after this realization, you feel like an infinite\nGround of Being underlying all your thoughts and in fact the entire world. When you jog across the\nstreets, no longer do you see yourself as a person relating to objects out there, rather, all objects and\ntrees and people and scenery actually emerge and subside and 'pass through' from within that Ground of\nBeing, much like the projections of a movie merely 'pass through' the screen. You no longer feel like\nsomeone that pass by things, rather your body and mind, the scenery and objects are merely 'projected\nfrom' and 'pass by' within unmoved Beingness.\nAbout this realization, John Tan also wrote before,\n“\n“Hi Mr. H,\nIn addition to what you wrote, I hope to convey another dimension of Presence to you. That is\nEncountering Presence in its first impression, unadulterated and full blown in stillness.\nSo after reading it, just feel it with your entire body-mind and forgot about it. Don't let it corrupt your\nmind.\nPresence, Awareness, Beingness, Isness are all synonyms. There can be all sorts of definitions but all\nthese are not the path to it. The path to it must be non-conceptual and direct. This is the only way.\nWhen contemplating the koan \"before birth who am I\", the thinking mind attempts to seek into it's\nmemory bank for similar experiences to get an answer. This is how the thinking mind works - compare,\ncategorize and measure in order to understand.\nHowever, when we encounter such a koan, the mind reaches its limit when it tries to penetrate its own\ndepth with no answer. There will come a time when the mind exhausts itself and come to a complete\nstandstill and from that stillness comes an earthshaking BAM!\nI. Just I.\nBefore birth this I, a thousand years ago this I, a thousand later this I. I AM I.\nIt is without any arbitrary thoughts, any comparisons. It fully authenticates it's own clarity, it's own\nexistence, ITSELF in clean, pure, direct non-conceptuality. No why, no because.\n41\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nJust ITSELF in stillness nothing else.\nIntuit the vipassana and the samantha. Intuit the total exertion and realization. The essence of message\nmust be raw and uncontaminated by words.\nHope that helps!” - John Tan, 2019”\nHowever someone who realize non-doership may not yet realize that Presence-Awareness, so doing self-\nenquiry (asking Who/What am I?) can help one going into that direction. The I AM realization is also\nimportant, and can serve as an important base for further insights, as explained in Anatta and Pure\nPresence. To realize I AM, the most direct method is Self-Inquiry, asking yourself 'Before birth, Who am I?'\nor just 'Who am I?' See: What is your very Mind right now?, and the self-inquiry chapter in The Awakening\nto Reality Practice Guide and AtR Guide - abridged version.\nIt is actually very important to have the direct realization of one's radiance, one's pristine consciousness\nor pure Presence. Without which, one's experience of no-self will be skewed to non-doership and one will\nnot experience pellucid non-dual luminosity. That is not considered genuine realization of anatman in\nAtR. For more reading on this topic, you can read Pellucid No-Self, Non-Doership, Nice Advice and\nExpression of Anatta from Yin Ling and Albert Hong + What is Experiential Insight?, Anatta and Pure\nPresence, Actual Freedom and the Immediate Radiance in the Transience, The Transient Universe has a\nHeart\n2) no-self in terms of the penetrating and dissolving of the subject/object or perceiver/perceived\ndichotomy. This relates to the sense of being an internal subjective perceiver perceiving the world of\nobjects in the senses. In other words, normal people feel deeply that they are relating to the world from\nbehind their own eyes, as someone perceiving an 'outside world' of trees and people and objects and so\non and the shapes and colors and characteristics of those trees/tables/objects are just inherent attributes\nof observer-independent objects 'out there', and they are merely observing them from a vantagepoint\n'within' their body as an internal perceiver -- subject, and object. Perceiver and perceived. And this is so\nnot only in relation to sights but even sounds and other sensory perceptions, for normal people hear\nsound as if the sound is somewhere 'out there' while they are located and hearing the sounds from\nsomewhere 'in here', that is to say, inside their own body (exactly where that is, is uncertain, and upon\nexamination some people may say it is the head, some people point to their heart, basically normal\npeople don't examine things clearly and just take their sense of self and duality for granted). But this\nsense of self and sense of duality is a very real experience for most people, that they have\nunquestioningly taken it for granted as their reality.\nIt should be understood and noted that someone who has experienced the non-doership or even\nimpersonality aspect of no-self in 1), may not experience non-duality in 2). In other words, one can still\nexperience everything happening on its own accord, but still feel like a dissociated observer detached\nfrom things happening on their own. In a sense, it's almost like everything the body and mind is doing\nseems like another person, like you are playing a third person shooter game where you are sort of\nwatching the whole character from a distance behind, except in a dissociated state you aren't even\n'controlling' the character people refer to as 'you' -- rather, you are merely observing this person or body-\nmind called 'you' acting and thinking and behaving in its own way and you are just this aloof and\n42\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\ndetached observer of this character or body-mind doing its own thing. Some people have experienced\nthis sort of dissociation coupled with a sense of non-doership.\nNow, this means that the sense of doership dissolving does not mean that the subject and object\ndichotomy is dissolved. Therefore we can call that sense of subject-object duality, or the gap between\nperceiver and perceived, as a distinct layer of 'self' that can be penetrated in deeper insight.\nNow, the dissolution of subject-object/perceiver-perceived dichotomy can happen as an experience,\nwhich is transient, short-lived peak experiences, or it can happen as a realization which leads to\nstabilization of non-dual experience.\nAs an experience, it is quite commonly experienced and described by people, often spontaneously when\nthey just enjoy music, watch a sunset, enjoy a beautiful scenery and so on, where they suddenly become\nso engaged and engrossed in their sensory experience that they have totally forgotten their 'self' -- and in\nthe act of forgetting the self they enter into what seems like a different state of consciousness, a very vivid\nand intensified one where they are no longer 'seeing' the sunset from a distance, they are the very sunset\nitself -- they may describe it as 'I have merged with the sun!' 'I have become the trees!' There is suddenly\nno longer this sense that 'I' am someone 'in here' separate from the 'sun over there', there is just brilliant\nand very alive bright orange light displaying itself to itself at no distance at all, a very vivid, brilliant and\nalive display of colors as clear vivid consciousness.\nIn describing such a peak experience, Michael Jackson wrote,\n“Consciousness expresses itself through creation. This world we live in is the dance of the creator.\nDancers come and go in the twinkling of an eye but the dance lives on. On many an occasion when I am\ndancing, I have felt touched by something sacred. In those moments, I felt my spirit soar and become one\nwith everything that exists.\nI become the stars and the moon. I become the lover and the beloved. I become the victor and the\nvanquished. I become the master and the slave. I become the singer and the song. I become the knower\nand the known. I keep on dancing then it is the eternal dance or creation. The creator and creation merge\ninto one wholeness of joy. I keep on dancing...and dancing...and dancing. Until there is only...the dance.”\nHowever, what is described here is still merely an experience. An experience of non-duality, but not the\nrealisation. Such experiences come and go. Some people engage in dangerous sports to enter the zone\nand glimpse the bliss of non-duality, some people do it through dance, some people through certain\ndrugs, some people do it through meditation.\nBut all these experiences come and go, until a paradigm shift takes place in consciousness where one\nsuddenly realizes that the truth about reality or consciousness is that there never was a subject and\nobject division, that consciousness was in truth never from the beginning ever divided into a perceiver\nand perceived, consciousness and its display, that they were never separate to begin with. After insights\ninto non-duality, the tendency will no longer be to dissociate from experience but to fully open to\nexperience in an undivided and gapless way -- experiencing everything without distance as vivid\nconsciousness.\nSuch a realization can however be divided into two types:\n43\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\na) substantialist/essentialist non-duality\nb) non-substantialist/non-essentialist non-duality\nThe latter, I call the realization of anatta, proper.\nBut lets talk about a) substantialist/essentialist non-duality in summary:\nSuch a person may have realized that their consciousness was never divided from manifestations, that all\nmanifestations are none other than consciousness itself. However the karmic (deep conditioning)\ntendency to conceive of consciousness as an inherently existing, unchanging source and substratum of\nphenomena, remains — except consciousness is now seen to be undivided from its manifestation, so one\nsubsumes everything to be modulations of Pure Consciousness. One sees that all phenomena are merely\nConsciousness displaying itself in various forms. Yet one does not equate the forms with consciousness --\nthe forms are like passing light shows displayed on an unchanging screen/mirror, while the projections\nand reflections pass through inseparably from the base of the mirror without subject/object division, the\nunderlying basis of consciousness remains unchanged. Hinduism can get as far to this point.\n3) No-Self in terms of what I call realization of Anatta\nBut then there is b), where one realizes that not only is it the case that all forms are merely modulations\nof consciousness, in actual fact 'Awareness' or 'Consciousness' is truly and only Everything -- in other\nwords, there is no 'Awareness' or 'Consciousness' besides the very luminous manifestation of the\naggregates, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, touched, cognized, smelled...\nAnatta is not merely a freeing of personality sort of experience; rather, there is an insight into the\ncomplete lack of a self/agent, a doer, a thinker, a watcher, etc, cannot be found apart from the moment to\nmoment flow of manifestation. Non-duality is thoroughly seen to be always already so: here is\neffortlessness in the non-dual and one realizes that in seeing there is always just scenery (no seer or even\nseeing besides the colors) and in hearing, always just sounds (never a hearer or even a hearing besides\nthe sounds). A very important point here is that Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma Seal, it is the nature of Reality\nall the time -- and not merely as a state free from personality, ego or the ‘small self’ or a stage to attain.\nThis means that it does not depend on the level of achievement of a practitioner to experience anatta but\nReality has always been Anatta and what is important here is the intuitive insight into it as the nature,\ncharacteristic, of phenomenon (dharma seal).\nTo illustrate further due to the importance of this seal, I would like to borrow a quote from the Bahiya\nSutta (http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/…/ajahn-amaro-on-non…)\n‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing, there is just the heard, no hearer’…\nIf a practitioner were to feel that he has gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a stage of\n‘becoming sound’ or takes that ‘there is just mere sound’, then this experience is again distorted. For in\nactual case, there is and always is only sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with.\nNothing attained for it is always so. This is the main difference between a momentary peak experience\n(lasting minutes or at most an hour) of non-duality, and a permanent quantum shift of perception that\nmakes that peak experience become a permanent mode of perception.\nThis is the seal of no-self and can be realized and experienced in all moments; not just a mere concept.\n44\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nIn summary, after the realization of anatta of b), and even a), non-dual no longer becomes a passing peak\nexperience that comes and goes, as the entire paradigm of consciousness, knot of perception, mental\nproliferation -- the continuous activity of projecting a 'self' or 'subject/object dichotomy' is severed at a\nmore fundamental level as the delusional framework through which one perceives the world is\nundermined. What I can say is that for me personally, for the past 9+ years after realizing anatta, I have\nnot experienced the slightest sense of subject/object duality or agency at all, not even the slightest trace.\nThat is gone for good and is not merely a peak experience here.\nWhat you described in your post is what I called 'non-doership'. And yes, that's a wonderful insight but\nthere are still more wonderful insights down the road that is truly life changing in a very positive way, that\nI cannot highly recommend enough.\nThe world experienced after realization and maturation of anatta, after all sense of self/Self in all its facets\nare totally dissolved, is truly wonderful. Here is how I described it in my (free) guide:\n\"This is a world where nothing can ever sully and touch that purity and perfection, where the whole of\nuniverse/whole of mind is always experienced vividly as that very purity and perfection devoid of any kind\nof sense of self or perceiver whatsoever that is experiencing the world at a distance from a vantagepoint -\n- life without ‘self’ is a living paradise free of afflictive/painful emotions, where every color, sound, smell,\ntaste, touch and detail of the world stands out as the very boundless field of pristine awareness, sparkling\nbrilliance/radiance, colorful, high-saturation, HD, luminous, heightened intensity and shining wonderment\nand magicality, where the surrounding sights, sounds, scents, sensations, smells, thoughts are seen and\nexperienced so clearly down to the tiniest details, vividly and naturally, not just in one sense door but all\nsix, where the world is a fairy-tale like wonderland, revealed anew every moment in its fullest depths as if\nyou are a new-born baby experiencing life for the first time, afresh and never seen before, where life is\nabundant with peace, joy and fearlessness even amidst the apparent chaos and troubles of life, and\neverything experienced through all the senses far surpasses any beauty previously experienced, as if the\nuniverse is like heaven made of glittering gold and jewels, experienced in complete gapless directness\nwithout separation, where life and the universe is experienced in its intense lucidity, clarity, aliveness and\nvivifying presence not only without intermediary and separation but without center and boundaries -\ninfinitude as vast as an endless night sky is actualized every moment, an infinitude that is simply the vast\nuniverse appearing as an empty, distanceless, dimensionless and powerful presencing, where the\nmountains and stars on the horizon stands out no more distant than one’s breath, and shines forth as\nintimately as one’s heartbeat, where the cosmic scale of infinitude is actualized even in ordinary activities\nas the entirety of the universe is always participating as every ordinary activity including walking and\nbreathing and one’s very body (without a trace of an ‘I’ or ‘mine’) is as much the universe/dependent\norigination in action and there is nothing outside of this boundless exertion/universe, where the purity\nand infinitude of the marvellous world experienced through being cleansed in all doors of perception is\nconstant. (If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is: Infinite. For\nman has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern. - William Blake)\"\nNon-doership is just one of the aspects of anatta, by itself it is not the anatta realization. (Thusness Stage\n5: \"...Phase 5 is quite thorough in being no one and I would call this anatta in all 3 aspects -- no\nsubject/object division, no doer-ship and absence of agent...\") One can experience non-doership during\n45\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nthe I AM phase, or for some people even before the I AM realization. Hence non-doership is not\nequivalent with anatta realization.\nAlthough the aspect of non-doership itself does not indicate the realization of anatta, this does not mean\nit is not important. Particularly, non-doership becomes clearly experienced when the John Tan's first\nstanza of anatta is penetrated and clearly realised. However, the first stanza of anatta is not merely non-\ndoership, as explained in the conversation here. The first stanza of anatta conveys both absence of agent\nand non-doership, and not just non-doership. Commenting on someone's breakthrough, John Tan said,\n\"More towards second stanza [of anatta], non-doership is equally important.\" and on someone else,\n\"Non-dual but can't discern clearly the difference between conventionalities and ultimate. Did it talk\nabout natural spontaneity? [In] The 2 stanzas of anatta, the non-doership will lead to natural spontaneity.\nCurrently it is talking about freedom from observer and observed, but the second part of realising\nappearances are just empty clarity isn't there. Therefore effortlessness of vivid presence will not be\npossible without these 2 insights as base.\"\nIt is my estimate that when someone says they have broken through to no-self, 95% to 99% of the\ntime they are referring to impersonality or non-doership, not even non dual, let alone the true\nrealization of anatman (Buddhism's no-self dharma seal). For those that claimed insight into no-\nself, I usually ask them to check their experience against this:\n\"What is experiential insight\nYin Ling:\nWhen we say experiential insight in Buddhism,\nIt means..\nA literal transformation of energetic orientation of the whole being, down to the marrow.\nThe sound MUST literally hears themselves.\nNo hearer.\nClean.

It’s their life.\nThey cannot even go back to dualistic perception because that is an imputation, it js uprooted\nAt first you might need to purposely orient with some effort.\nThen at one point there is no need.. further along, dreams will become Anatta too.\nThat’s experiential realisation.\nThere’s no realisation unless this benchmark is achieved!”\n......\n\"Soh:\nwhat is important is that there is experiential realisation that leads\nto an energetic expansion outwards into all the forms, sounds, radiant\nuniverse... such that it is not that you are in here, in the body,\nlooking outwards at the tree, listening the birds chirping from here\nit is just the trees are vividly swaying in and of itself, luminously\nwithout an observer\nthe trees sees themselves\nthe sounds hear itself\nthere is no location from which they are experienced, no vantage point\nthe energetic expansion outward into vivid manifestation, boundless, yet\nit is not an expansion from a center, there is just no center\nwithout such energetic shift it is not really the real experience of no\nselfxabir Snoovatar\" - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2022/12/the-difference-between-experience-\nof.html\nLabels: Anatta, Yin Ling | \"\nAlso.. “Sound hearing themselves, sights see themselves” etc\nThats just nondual. A state of no mind. This is not yet the realisation of anatman.\nWhats more important is the realization of anatta as a dharma seal and which sees through the referents\nof inherent view\nAs I wrote before:\n“Mr JD, regarding your question:\nNot so. Recently I wrote to someone:\nJust yesterday someone at the I AM phase told me, he said “I have a hard time seeing foreground\n[appearance] as \"awareness.\" Probably just equating \"awareness\" and \"background\" in my mind.” I told\n47\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nhim thats because he has some definition of awareness that is blocking him. He told me “So forget\ndefinition of awareness and just see the radical aliveness of \"foreground.\" That is enough, yeah?” I told\nhim “No, not just forget definition of awareness. You need to deeply look into it, challenge it, investigate\nit”. I also sent him some texts I sent to another person earlier and said “Having an experience without\nbackground [as an experience of no mind] is not the same as realizing there never was a background\nsubject or a seer or a seeing besides or behind the seen. The latter must arise as a realization. So you\nneed to analyse in direct experience.\nKhamtrul Rinpoche on the realization of anatta in the Mahamudra text:\n\"At that point, is the observer—awareness—other than the observed—stillness and movement—or is it\nactually that stillness and movement itself? By investigating with the gaze of your own awareness, you\ncome to understand that that which is investigating itself is also no other than stillness and movement.\nOnce this happens you will experience lucid emptiness as the naturally luminous self-knowing awareness.\nUltimately, whether we say nature and radiance, undesirable and antidote, observer and observed,\nmindfulness and thoughts, stillness and movement, etc., you should know that the terms of each pair are\nno different from one another; by receiving the blessing of the guru, properly ascertain that they are\ninseparable. Ultimately, to arrive at the expanse free of observer and observed is the realization of the\ntrue meaning and the culmination of all analyses. This is called “the view transcending concepts,” which is\nfree of conceptualization, or “the vajra mind view.”\n\"Fruition vipashyana is the correct realization of the final conviction of the nonduality of observer and\nobserved.\"\nWhat Khamtrul Rinpoche said above is not just mere experience. It sees through the conventions and\nanalysis and realized the emptiness of these conventions.\nIn buddhism, non analytical cessations like states of no-mind and samadhi does not liberate. Only\nanalytical cessation based on wisdom that penetrates and sees through the wrong view of inherent\nexistence is able to liberate. The prajna wisdom that realizes the dharma seal of anatta, dependent\norigination and emptiness.\n——\nIn the past, many years ago, I visited a Zen center in Geylang many times, whose master is a very famous\nKorean Zen master with many established dharma centers throughout the world, who passed away in the\nearly 2000s. I found his writings quite resonating because he was able to express simply and articulately\nthe state of no-mind. I read many books by him. He even said things like, \"your true self has no outside,\nno inside. Sound is clear mind, clear mind is sound. Sound and hearing are not separate, there is only\nsound.\", and so on.\nHowever I was dismayed to find out later that he was having the experience of no mind but the view of\none mind, meaning that he has not had the realisation of anatman that penetrated the view of inherent\nexistence. As a result, despite his nondual experience, he was still unable to overcome the view of an\ninherently existing one substance modulating as many, which is the view of substantiated nonduality\n(nondual based on substance or essence view). I only realised this after reading in more details his views\nand writings and found an article where he expressed that Dharma-nature is the universal substance\nwhich everything in the universe is composed, is an unchanging substance that is formless like h2o but\ncan appear as rain, snow, fog, vapor, river, sea, sleet, and ice, and everything is different forms of the\nsame universal and unchanging substance.\nIt is clear to me that he experiences nondual and no-mind, but what he said above is still precisely reifying\nan ontological, universal, one, indivisible and unchanging source and substratum that is the \"one without\n48\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\na second\" manifesting as many. This is having a view of inherent existence pertaining to a metaphysical\nsource and substratum even though it is nondual with phenomena.\nI informed John Tan the above in 2018 and he replied, “To me yes. Mistaken experience due to lack of\nview. That is Zen's problem imo. No mind is an experience. Insight of anatta must arise, then refine one's\nview.\" (This is a general trend but there are many Zen masters with clear view and deep realisations too)\nAnother American Zen writer, whose books I have enjoyed reading and found to be quite resonating in\nmany ways, because he was able to express the experience of no-mind and what I call Maha total\nexertion. He wrote that the Buddha mind is mountains, rivers, and the earth, the sun, moon, and stars.\nAnd that \"In the state of authentic practice and enlightenment, the cold kills you, and there is only cold in\nthe whole universe. The heat kills you, and there is only heat in the whole universe. The fragrance of\nincense kills you, and there is only the fragrance of incense in the whole universe. The sound of the bell\nkills you, and there is only “boooong” in the whole universe…\" This is a good expression of no mind.\nHowever, later on, upon further reading, I was disappointed to find out that he is still lacking realization\ninto anatman, and hence did not go beyond the view of one mind yet having no mind experience. He\ncontinued to assert that \"Objects of mind come and go in an endless stream, contents of awareness arise\nand cease – mind or awareness is the unchanging realm in which objects come and go, the immutable\ndimension wherein the contents of awareness arise and cease\", and although he sees awareness as\nunchanging while all phenomena are changing, he insists awareness is nondual with phenomena: \"In\nshort, reality is nondual (not-two), thus everything in reality is an intrinsic aspect or element of that one\nreality.\"\nIt is clear that despite his nondual experience up to no mind, the view of inherent existence is very strong,\nand subtly dual. The desync between view and experience persists. It is having the atman view of an\nunchanging and inherently existing one reality yet being nondual with everything. I could go on and on\nand cite countless other teachers and practitioners, whether Buddhist or non-Buddhist, that are having\nthis problem, because it is very common.\nThis is why anatta is not just the experience of no-mind, or a nondual experience, or even the realisation\nof the non-division between subject and object, perceiver and perceived, hearing and sound. Many\npractitioners and teachers unfortunately mistaken it to be so. It should instead be a realization that sees\nthroughs, cuts through the view of inherent existence of a source/substratum/awareness. It is the\nrealization that only vivid luminous manifestation knows and rolls without ever a knower or an agent,\nmuch like there is no wind that is the agent of blowing or lightning that is the agent of flash (both are just\ndependent designations and mere names）, and also there is no ontological or metaphysical essence\nthat exists in any way or form.\nSo after breakthrough from I AM to nondual, it is crucial to get out of “one substance” view and phase\nthrough the realization of anatman. Even this is just a start.\nIn recent weeks more people realized anatman in my blog and I have been guiding them into deeper\ninsights into dependent origination and emptiness. However, genuine insights of emptiness and\ndependent origination cannot be understood without deep understanding of our consciousness, our\nempty clarity. I generally do not confuse people too much on dependent origination and emptiness until\nthey are thoroughly clear about the realization of anatta through the two stanzas, the 2 authentications of\nanatta, because that is the base. Everything is empty of inherent existence but vividly clear and radiant,\neverything appears because it is all radiance of clarity. Therefore to have deep insight, the direct\nauthentication of one's radiance and clarity is crucial. Anatman realization is key.\nIn the first stanza, the background subject, agent, watcher, doer is seen through, everything is\nspontaneous arising. In the second stanza, seeing is just the seen, one’s radiance clarity and presence-\nawareness is directly authenticated as all appearances, as all mountains, rivers, the great earth.\n49\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nBoth stanzas are equally important. Lacking this direct authentication of radiance as all vivid appearance,\nthis powerful taste and insight of all transience as Presence-Awareness, is not what I call an authentic\nrealization of anatman. It can be either an intellectual understanding, or still skewed towards non-\ndoership, not yet nondual and anatta. Yet even if one has the realization of awareness as vivid\nappearance, it can still fall into substantialist nondual, so one must be careful to deepen insight and see\nthrough any remaining views and sense of an inherently existing and unchanging awareness.\nThe two authentications of anatta are like what I wrote earlier, “Stanza 1\nThere is thinking, no thinker\n�There is hearing, no hearer\n�There is seeing, no seer\nStanza 2\nIn thinking, just thoughts\n�In hearing, just sounds\nIn seeing, just forms, shapes and colors.\nThis must be realized as a dharma seal. Insight that 'anatta' is a seal and not a stage must arise to further\nprogress into the 'effortless' mode. That is, anatta is the ground of all experiences and has always been\nso, no I. In seeing, always only seen, in hearing always only sound and in thinking, always only thoughts.\nNo effort required and never was there an 'I'.\nTherefore, I think it is important to stress on anatta as a realisation of dharma seal, which is to say, in\nseeing just the seen, never has there been a seer. This is not a stage where the sense of a seer dissolve\ninto just the seen, as this can just be a stage without the prajna wisdom that pierces and sees through the\nconstruct of an internal reference point of a perceiver/inherently existing perceiving, as fundamentally\nillusory and empty. Having an experience of no-mind is not very difficult nor uncommon, it is actually\nmuch more rare to have the realisation of anatta, even though the realisation of anatta is also just\nanother start along the path to Buddhahood. Many focus on the experience, and there is a lack of clarity\nto penetrate the differences. It is rare to find practitioners and teachers that truly realized anatta. Most\npeople that has nondual experience take \"in the seen just the seen\" as simply a state of no mind, rather\nthan the more important realization that sees through the referencepoint of an inherently existing self,\nperceiver, agent, awareness, perceiving that could exist in and of itself apart from manifestation, seeing\nthat always already, there never was a seer or even a seeing besides the seen, always already so.”\nIt's late here and this post is getting way too long and I will address some of your issues regarding non-\ndoership in a separate post tomorrow.\n—-\nThe poster replied:\nOh my world..\nI am lost for words right now. I'll try to reply properly when all this has sunk in a bit. You do actually\nunderstand. You describe other experiences I have had as well, or glimpses and even \"suspicions\". I very\nmuch look forward to read what you have to say about the issues on non-doership. You have no idea how\ngrateful I am for this. Or.. perhaps you do, actually. I have read it twice now, and I will read it again. Wow.\n50\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nI think I should read your guide as well. I just scrolled through the table of content and it looks very\ninteresting.\nThank you so, so much!\n----------\nThe next day, I wrote more:\nMore replies:\nAfter describing the different facets of self/Self and no-self/Self, I'll dwell a little into the pitfalls and\nmisunderstandings of non-doership and no-self.\nSomeone who goes through non-doership experiences spontaneity and a sense of freedom to a certain\ndegree, yet it often comes with a great deal of confusion that only gets cleared up with deeper insights or\npointers.\nOne possible pitfall is that one could end up with a confused understanding of no-self and non-action.\nI wrote this in Facebook in reply to a friend Din Robinson to whom Thusness wrote his \"7 stages of\nexperience\" (originally 6) in 2006:\nDin: \"as soon as you take any action or any need for training, then you are perpetuating the myth of a\n\"you\" that exists in time and space, not that there's any wrong with that!\"\nMy reply:\nThis is not true. This is as ridiculous as saying \"as long as you take any action to keep fit, such as going to\ngym, then you are perpetuating the myth of a \"you\" that exists in time and space\"\nor\n\"as long as you take any action to pass your exams, such as studying hard, then you are perpetuating the\nmyth of a \"you\" that exists in time and space\"\nor\n\"as long as you take any action to survive, such as eating and sleeping, then you are perpetuating the\nmyth of a \"you\" that exists in time and space\"\nor\n\"as long as you take any action to cure your disease, such as seeing the doctor, then you are perpetuating\nthe myth of a \"you\" that exists in time and space\"\n51\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nNo-self/Anatta is not about denying thinking, action, carrying water and chopping wood... and this is the\nkey difference between genuine anatta insight from dualistic conceptual understanding. The very notion\nthat \"action\" and \"intention\" implies, or necessitates, an \"actor\", and therefore for non-action the\nintentions and actions must also cease, is precisely using dualistic thinking to understanding anatta...\nAction never required a self (in fact there never was a self or a doer apart from action to begin with: only\na delusion of one), and action does not need to perpetuate the myth of a self. The myth of a self is not\nexactly dependent on action or lack thereof. Sure, action that arises out of the dualistic sense of actor/act\nwhere there is an \"I\" trying to modify or achieve \"that\" is a form of action produced by ignorance. But not\nall actions necessarily arise out of an underlying sense of duality. If all actions arise out of a sense of\nduality, then after awakening one will just die as he cannot even feed himself.\nWhen one is operating with a dualistic way of understanding, one thinks that action implies a self that is\ndoing an act, and one thinks that non-action implies that the self ends with the action. But genuine insight\ninto non-action is simply the realization that never was there a real actor behind action, so there is always\nin acting just that action - whole being is only the total exertion of action, and this is always already the\ncase but not realized. That is true non-action - there is no subject (actor) performing an act (object).\nFuthermore: The myth of a self is not dependent on practice and lack thereof. (Oh but, 'right practice' and\n'contemplation' does a lot to deconstruct that myth!) The myth of a self is however dependent on\nignorance, and only wisdom ends that ignorance, just like turning on the lights lead to the natural\ncessation of irrational fear and thinking of monster in the dark room by a child.\nThere is always only action without a doer. No doer does not deny action, it denies agency, and realization\nof such leads to the direct, immediate, experience of total exertion/total action where doer/deed is\nrefined till none in one whole movement. There is nothing passive about non-action. Non-action is simply\naction without self/Self. All actions performed without sense of self/Self is in fact non-action. Without the\nsubjective pole (actor), the objective pole in contrast to the subject (being acted upon) is also\nautomatically negated. Yet clearly, the total exertion - pure action... goes on.\nDogen calls this practice-enlightenment. You do not practice For enlightenment (as some future goal\nseparated from you). Your very practice of actualizing insight of anatta itself is practice-enlightenment.\nSitting down is practice is actualization is Buddha-nature is enlightenment. Shitting too can be\npractice/actualization and that very act is Buddha-nature is enlightenment. Your very\npractice/actualization/act of just sitting, hearing the wind blowing, sight of scenery, walking on the street,\nchop wood carry water (without any delusion of self/Self) - that itself is practice-actualization-\nenlightenment, that is the total exertion where entire being is just entire sound, entire scenery, entire\naction.. This is non-dual practice and non-dual action.\n2) A misunderstanding of no-self leads to a fatalistic and deterministic idea that negates or\nmisunderstands causality and dependent origination. No-self in Buddhadharma is based on the\nunderstanding of dependent origination. But dependent origination should not be misunderstood as\nfatalism or with the idea that 'nothing can be done to accomplish things'.\nIt would be erroneous if a doctor realizes there is no self, therefore, tells his patients that all diseases are\n52\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nkind of fated or predetermined and so one should just passively surrender to the flow of things and just\nsee what happens. Of course that is just silly. They should be dealt with, quickly and actively. But they are\ndealt with not via attempting to exert control or hard will via by the false notion of agency (sickness can't\nbe cured merely by trying to will or control it out of existence - there are so many dependencies involved).\nThey are dealt with via seeing its dependent origination and treating its dependent origination in a non-\ninherent way. Likewise the Buddha is like a great doctor that completely discerns our disease and the\ncure to our disease, and this is how through discerning dependent origination he taught the four noble\ntruths: the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path that ends suffering\n(which is the noble eightfold path).\nAlso, as John Tan/Thusness said many years ago:\n“Nihilistic tendencies arise when the insight of anatta is skewed towards the no-doership aspect. The\nhappening by itself must be correctly understood. It appears that things are accomplished by doing\nnothing but in actual case it is things get done due to ripening of action and conditions.\nSo the lack of self-nature does not imply nothing needs be done or nothing can be done. That is one\nextreme. At the other end of extreme is the self-nature of perfect control of what one wills, one gets. Both\nare seen to be false. Action + conditions leads to effect.”\n3) Are you aware of the seven factors of awakening taught by the Buddha? They are mindfulness,\ninvestigation, energy, rapture, tranquility, stability of mind, and equanimity. This is how we should\ncultivate in our practice and also gauge where our practice is at. These are the factors to be cultivated,\nthat leads to awakening and liberation. This means our practice should make us joyous, radiant, bright,\naware, tranquil, calm, focused, with energy, have deeper insights, and so on. These positive qualities of\nmind naturally grow more and more as we practice. But if instead we become more and more like a\nzombie, more and more lethargic and demotivated, that means something is going wrong in our direction\nand we should investigate that and correct it. After maturing of anatta one feels great energy coursing\nthrough one's body and even one's complexions naturally radiates the joy and luminosity that is\nexperienced.\nI remember one of the first things John Tan/Thusness asked someone many years ago after that person\ndescribed certain insight of no-self and non-doership, he asked, \"has zealous energy arisen?\" and\ncommented, \"Advisable to bring the insight of anatta into the active mode.\"\nSo it is good to know that there is the passive and active mode of no-self .\nThere is the passive way of non-doership where one just let things happen on its own, but this is often\ncoupled with a sense of dissociation because one's level of insight has not reached into non-dual level yet.\nEven after anatta non-duality, it often takes some time to mature that insight and experience such that\nanatta enters into total action and total exertion. You remember what I said about Michael Jackson? He\ndanced until all sense of self is forgotten into 'just the dance'. Notice that he wasn't sitting cross-legged in\nlotus posture, he was totally engaged. The people doing dangerous sports also often report entering the\nzone and forgetting the self into a state of complete unity with their action and environment because any\nmissteps can mean death, and it is this heightened state of aliveness and ego-death in that moment of\ntotal engagement in activity that is also itself the allure of engaging in such activities. But alas, all these\n53\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nare but passing peak experiences since they have not realised anatta. It is not necessary to engage in\nextraordinary feats to achieve such states of peak experience, the realisation of anatta turns the ordinary\nand mundane activities of daily living into marvelous activities of buddha-nature and total exertion.\nHowever all these people described above are not just experiencing a 'passive experience of non-\ndoership' -- yet their sense of self is completely dissolved. What's the difference? They're not just\n'passively watching things unfold on its own'. Far from merely watching things float by with passive\ndisinterest from behind as some sort of dissociated watcher... They are totally focused, totally in the zone,\ntotally engaged with their whole being/body-mind and their intentions in their action, till the gap between\nactor and action, doer and deed, observer and observed is refined till none, into that very activity itself. It\nis like the dissolution of subject/object not just in passively experiencing a sound without hearer or sight\nwithout seer, but also in that very full engagement of action without a separate actor. That is true non-\naction, which is not literally passive inactivity but non-dual action, action without the sense of self, or\none's whole being is the action. It is total engagement in action without sense of self, not only without the\nsense of a doer, but also without the sense of being a passive watcher.\nAs I said earlier, once realization of anatta arises, non-duality becomes the natural state and is realised to\nbe always already the case. Initially after insight one may still be prone to experiencing non-duality in a\nstate of passivity -- just relaxing and letting the sensory experiences and events just arise in a non-dual\nstate, experiencing no-self in a state of passivity like just enjoying the scenery to the point of completely\nforgetting the self in the vivid brilliance or luminosity of the scenery, the sounds, the sensations and\naromas, etc -- this time it is effortless and natural, without entry or exit -- for one realizes that in seeing,\nseeing is just colors without seer, and hearing is just sounds without hearer.\nAnd yet mature insight into anatta also allows us the path to completely and gaplessly engage in actions\nto the point of dissolving all sense of self in that activity. The last stage of the ten oxherding pictures of\nZen is called 'entering the marketplace'. The experience of total action/non-action/non-dual action is\nbasically sort of like being in the zone as mentioned above, but the importance is realizing and actualizing\nthis as a natural state in all activities, and that is only possible after realising anatta. After realising anatta\n(and not just non-doership), it is very natural and effortless to completely engage in activity to the point of\nleaving no trace of self and fully actualizing your true nature as that very activity. This is heavily\nemphasized in Zen, but even basic Theravada teachings can get you there if understood well -\n- https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2012/10/total-exertion_20.html - I discussed a conversation I\nhad with a Zen master and this might interest you.\nThis non-dual action eventually matures into total exertion, which is emphasized in certain teachings like\nSoto Zen and Zen Master Dogen. Total exertion is like when you are eating, the whole universe is eating.\nWhen you walk, the whole sky and mountains walks with you. At this point, in every mundane experience\nand activity, you experience the infinitude of the universe exerting as that activity.\nThusness: \"[Total] Exertion is after the realization of seamless interdependence, the practitioner feels the\nuniverse giving its best to make this moment possible. Read the dogen of rowing the boat.\"\nDogen: \"Birth is just like riding in a boat. You raise the sails, row with the oar, and steer. Although you\nrow, the boat gives you a ride, and without the boat you couldn't ride. But you ride in the boat and your\nriding makes the boat what it is… When you ride in a boat, your body and mind and the environs together\n54\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nare the undivided activity of the boat. The entire earth and the entire sky are both the undivided activity\nof the boat.\"\n\"With going the boundless sky goes, with coming the entire earth comes. This is everyday mind.\"\nNow, if you mature your insights to the point of true non-action and total exertion, you will not end up in\na state of dissociation, passivity and lethargy. Instead, one lives life to its fullest, literally -- in all areas of\nlife, fully alive, fully engaged and yet non-attached.\nMy impression from your post is that you are experiencing non-doership but with a sense of dissociation,\nalong with some confusion. But if you progress in insights and practice in accordance with the AtR guide,\nor find a good Zen master (there are many good ones especially from the Soto Zen/Dogen's lineage) that\ncan lead you to total exertion, your problems will be solved. You will come to experience whatever I said\nin this thread.\nAs John Tan/Thusness said before:\n“When anatta matures, one is fully and completely integrated into whatever arises till there is no\ndifference and no distinction.\nWhen sound arises, fully and completely embraced with sound yet non-attached. Similarly, in life we must\nbe fully engaged yet non-attached” - John Tan/Thusness\n“Actually there is no forcing. All the 4 aspects in I AMness are fully expressed in anatta as I told you. If\naliveness is everywhere, how is one not to engage… it is a natural [tendency] to explore in [various]\narena[s] and enjoy in business, family, spiritual practices... I [am] involve[d] in Finance, business, society,\nnature, spirituality, yoga... . I don't find it efforting… You just don't have to boast about this and\nthat and be non-dual and open.” - John Tan/Thusness, 2019\n“Just met a friend yesterday who recently started meditating. His girlfriend joked that he might be\nbecoming a monk. I told him that besides the daily sitting meditation (which is very important even after\nanatman realization, let alone before - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/how-silent-\nmeditation-helped-me-with.html), practice is mostly and very much in daily life and engagement rather\nthan in some remote region in the mountains, it is about living a life in the marketplace that is\nspontaneously beneficial for oneself and others around, and joyful, rather than one that is miserable. It is\nfully engaged and free.\nZen Master Bernie Glassman said,\n“At its deepest, most basic level, Zen—or any spiritual path, for that matter—is much more than a list of\nwhat we can get from it. In fact, Zen is the realization of the oneness of life in all its aspects. It’s not just\nthe pure or “spiritual” part of life: it’s the whole thing. It’s flowers, mountains, rivers, streams, and the\ninner city and homeless children on Forty-second Street. It’s the empty sky and the cloudy sky and the\nsmoggy sky, too. It’s the pigeon flying in the empty sky, the pigeon shitting in the empty sky, and walking\nthrough the pigeon droppings on the sidewalk. It’s the rose growing in the garden, the cut rose shining in\n55\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nthe vase in the living room, the garbage where we throw away the rose, and the compost where we throw\naway the garbage. Zen is life—our life. It’s coming to the realization that all things are nothing but\nexpressions of myself. And myself is nothing but the full expression of all things. It’s a life without limits.\nThere are many different metaphors for such a life. But the one that I have found the most useful, and\nthe most meaningful, comes from the kitchen. Zen masters call a life that is lived fully and completely,\nwith nothing held back, “the supreme meal.” And a person who lives such a life—a person who knows\nhow to plan, cook, appreciate, serve, and offer the supreme meal of life, is called a Zen cook.”\n“But why does a venerable elder such as yourself waste time doing the hard work of a head cook?” Dogen\npersisted. “Why don’t you spend your time practicing meditation or studying the words of the masters?”\nThe Zen cook burst out laughing, as if Dogen had said something very funny. “My dear foreign friend,” he\nsaid, “it’s clear you do not yet understand what Zen practice is all about. When you get the chance, please\ncome and visit me at my monastery so we can discuss these matters more fully.” And with that, he\ngathered up his mushrooms and began the long journey back to his monastery. Dogen did eventually\nvisit and study with the Zen cook in his monastery, as well as with many other masters. When he finally\nreturned to Japan, Dogen became a celebrated Zen master. But he never forgot the lessons he learned\nfrom the Zen cook in China.”\n- Zen Master Bernie Glassman” - Soh, 2019\n“In Zen, enlightenment implies full integration into activities. Any lack of such insight is not 'enlightenment\nin Zen'.” - John Tan, 2010\n“My daily activities are not unusual,\nI'm just naturally in harmony with them.\nGrasping nothing, discarding nothing,\nIn every place there's no hindrance, no conflict.\nWho assigns the ranks of vermilion and purple?\nThe hills' and mountains' last speck of dust\nis extinguished.\n[My] supernatural power and marvelous activity—\nDrawing water and carrying firewood.” - Layman Pang\nAn old Zen saying— “Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood\nand carry water.”\nAlso see: a conversation I had with a Zen master in 2012, Total\nExertion http://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2012/10/total-exertion_20.html\n“What you said is very good. I was reminded of a discussion I just had with Thusness about a new book by\nTony Parsons called \"This Freedom\".\nI asked Thusness what freedom is. Freedom is not doing what one likes, that would be still self-view. It is\nalso not just simply being unentangled within the paradigm of duality of subject/object, life/death\ndivision.\n56\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\nThe realization of anatta and emptiness relinquishes the self and reified constructs, consequently artificial\nboundaries and hindrance are also dissolved.\nWhen artificial constructs are dissolved, the natural, primordial and untainted are also spontaneously\nmanifested in every engagement. If it is not, then one risks the danger of still being entangled in a non-\ndual ultimate and drowned in stagnant water. Hence there is a difference in understanding non-dual free\nfrom the framework of duality and the actualization of the non-dual realization as the spontaneity of\naction that is full of energy and compassion.\nSo as Thusness pointed out to me, freedom must be realized not simply as non-attachment but also as\nboundless expression that is full of life and power.\nTherefore not only the path of non-attachment is seen clearly but the way of boundless compassion and\npowerful viriya (energy) must also be directly felt and lived. Not immobilized by artificial constructs and\nduality, action is natural and spontaneous; without self, there is no hesitation and obstruction.\nIf one only sees freedom as non-attachment, then one will have missed an enormous part of the\nexperiential insight of anatta and will not understand why Mipham is so insistent on talking about the\npositive attributes of Buddha, yet not falling into the views of Shentong.\nFor example when Thusness asked me what fear is, my answer had mostly to do with the\nmental/psychological factors and attachment. However what Thusness want me to see is that fear is not\nonly overcome by non-attachment but also by the feeling of unbounded life and energy.\nBtw, do you do yoga or any form of energy practice?” – Soh, 2016\n\"And when you experience, a person will feel radiance bright. Means when you see him, you will find\nradiance bright, you know? Because once a person experience non-duality, there is no holding, there is\njust luminosity. There is just a pure sense of existence, of clarity, of all things. Somehow, there is an\nutmost joy and energy that flows from everywhere, that sustains a person. This is its nature.” - John Tan,\n2007, https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/p/normal-0-false-false-false-en-sg-zh-cn.html\nI remember one of the first things John Tan/Thusness asked someone many years ago after that person\ndescribed certain insight of no-self and non-doership, he asked, \"has zealous energy arisen?\" and\ncommented, \"Advisable to bring the insight of anatta into the active mode.\"\nUpdate 2025:\nDue to the specific circumstances of the individual I was addressing this article to, I intentionally refrained\nfrom elaborating on further insights beyond the initial anatta breakthrough. Providing more information\nat that stage would have been overwhelming for someone who was still at the very beginning of their\njourney.\nHowever, I want to emphasize that the insights described above, even after a genuine realization of\nanatman, represent just the beginning. Additional insights will naturally unfold over time. To further\nelaborate, I will cite some of the thoughts shared by John Tan:\n57\nThe Original Text of John’s Seven Stages of Enlightenment\n\"Anatta is allow recognition of appearances as one's radiance. But that is still not anatta proper without\nrecognition of dependent arising.\nSo one can realize anatta on the aspect of the agency being a conventional construct that does not exist\nin the \"experiencer experiencing\" or \"hearer hearing sound\" or \"seer seeing scenery\" ...etc but still not\nrealize dependent arising and it's implication and vice versa.\nSo anatta,\ndependent arising and emptiness,\nthen both.\nThen dependent arising and the relationship of nominal constructs and causal efficacy.\nThen dependent arising and spontaneous presence.\nAnd natural perfection.\nAll these must be clear.\", \"It [Soh: an initial breakthrough to certain aspects of no-self but not the\ndefinitive wisdom of selflessness taught by Buddha] can also be no self being resolved into monism.\nIt can also be selflessness and essencelessness yet have no insight dependent arising is free from 8\nextremes.\"\nSoh on the related \"Eight Negations\":\nChatGPT translation\nof http://www.masterhsingyun.org/article/article.jsp?index=37&item=257&bookid=2c907d4944dd5ce701\n44e285bec50005&ch=3&se=17&f=1 \"The so-called 'Eight Negations' are: not arising, not ceasing, not\npermanent, not continuous, not one, not different, not coming, and not going. These Eight Negations\nprimarily aim to dismantle the clinging to the inherent self-nature of sentient beings. In other words, the\nphenomena dependent on origination are inherently empty and unattainable. However, ordinary beings,\nheterodox practitioners, and those with some attainments fail to realize the emptiness of all phenomena.\nThey persistently cling to the reality of things, from the common-sense reality to the metaphysical reality,\nunable to transcend their delusional views of inherent self-nature.\nThese self-inherent views manifest in various ways:\n• In time: Views of permanence and cessation.\n• In space: Views of oneness and difference.\n• In the movement of time and space: Clinging to 'coming and going.'\n• In the true nature of phenomena: Clinging to 'arising and ceasing.'\n•\nThese eight measures of arising and ceasing are the root causes of sentient beings' confusion and do not\nalign with the Middle Way, which is free from all delusional views and conceptual fabrications. Therefore,\nNagarjuna Bodhisattva established the 'Eight Negations' to eliminate all confusions of attainment and to\nreveal the Middle Way of non-attainment. As the ancients said:\n58\nQuick pointers for each stage\n'The wind of the marvelous doctrine of the Eight Negations sweeps away the dust of delusional thoughts\nand conceptual fabrications; the moon of correct insight into non-attainment floats on the water of the\nMiddle Way of reality.'\"\nAlso see: Dark Night of the Soul, Depersonalization, Dissociation, and Derealization\nQuick pointers for each stage\n“Now over the course of hundreds [or thousands] of years, there are voluminous scripts about this and\nthat… what is important is just the essence… Meaning, if you go into emptiness teaching and dependent\norigination, just [focus on] the essence... treat it just like koan… there is no Zen koan like Madhyamaka\nthat can allow us to penetrate so deeply. There is no koan like Dogen’s total exertion that can convey the\nexperience of this immensity of being \"connected\" in such a magical way…\nTo me, just these 4 pointings are sufficient: direct pointing to awareness, to anatta, to total exertion and\nemptiness. The rest is deepening your insights and realizations through encounter and devoted\npractices.” - John Tan, 2017\n“I have told you that to leap out of the conditioned mind, then intellect and be authenticated directly,\nkoan is an effective tool.\n...\nAnatta is an even better koan. No self... the stanza will enable one to trigger the leap into clear seeing\nand effortless authentication in all manifestation. It is a fundamental shift from substantial view created\nby our grammatical structure.” – John Tan, 2020\n\"You must have a keen eye, every cell must turn alive and \"spirit\", get it? The phases of insights are\nanalogous to energy channels, every passing through must make you more marvelous till you become\none creative expression, one mighty alive action, one spirited activity. Don't adulterate it with mind\nintellect and stain it with concepts... but it is so hard to transmit so for the eye to fully open. Often it is\nbest to be in koan and observe the conditions with one's entire being...\" - John Tan to me, 2013\n\"In the seen just the seen. But instead of just sound, because you realize it, it is wonderful... something\nvery very alive. The spark of wonder. It is not something that is dull, like a samadhi experience. There is a\nlot of difference. So there is a quality that is like that in that experience.\n吾有正法眼藏，涅槃妙心，实相无相，微妙法门，不立文字，教外别传，付嘱摩诃迦叶。\nSeeing Mahākāśyapa's smile the Buddha said, I possess the Treasury of the Correct Dharma Eye , the\nwonderful heart-mind of Nirvana, the formless true form, the subtle Dharma gate, not established by\nwritten words, transmitted separately outside the teaching. I hand it over and entrust these encouraging\nwords to Kashyapa.\n59\nQuick pointers for each stage\nHe is referring to something very vibrant and alive. That you must directly cut through. Means it is an\ninstant illumination, Realization, all the discursive thoughts and everything just ceases in that moment of\nillumination. But realization can realize many things. For example I want to teach you wu qing, they only\nteach you very minimum music, they do not teach you a lot of concepts... lets say you are of very high\ncalibre, very high capacity, it is not something intellectual. They want you to feel with your entire being...\nthat sound, tingggg... then (?) play the music, then you feel it, means you are able to feel with your entire\nbody-mind, feel with your entire being. It is not something that is intellectual. So a person of high capacity\nis when the teacher find that he has this capacity to feel and understand directly, heart to heart, a cut\nthrough of all intellectual verbalization and understand directly. This is what we call a person of high\ncapacity.\nSo that when we talk about non-dual it is not at a conceptual level, he can feel with his entire being this is\nnon-dual, this is clarity, this is impermanence, this is non-arising. So a person of high capacity is like that.\nOtherwise, you go through step by step, that is like... sudden awakening. Gradual practice and sudden\nawakening.\n不立文字，教外别传；直指人心，见性成佛。\nNot relying on words or letters.\nAn independent transmission outside the teaching of the scriptures.\nDirectly pointing to man's Mind.\nAwakening of one's (Original-) Nature, thereby actualizing one's own Buddhahood.\nBut this is not pointing out man's Mind. This is just.. first of all we have to understand Realization.\nRealization is something that is like that. That's why I said the eye of immediacy. The eye that feel sound\nas sound and understand it. This means you feel with your entire being, feel with your entire body-mind.\nOnce the teacher understand and see that this student has the capacity to do this, then he redirect this\nentire wisdom eye, or the eye that is open back to itself to understand clarity. So when he communicates,\nit is not about intellectual level, he wants the whole of the essence raw, he hands it to you. He does not\nwant to explain and explain, certain things cannot be explained. When you explain you are actually\ncontaminating it. I am teaching you so much but it is all words. But can you taste it or not? So I cannot\nexplain to you so much. Like keep asking you Phase 7 is what? Phase 6 is what? Phase 5 is what? Phase...\nAs a good teacher... That's why I said, this is raw, this is not written anywhere, you have to taste it\nyourself, first hand, not second hand. Then you understand. Then your entire body mind must be open,\nyour whole being must be opened, you feel it... this aliveness. You understand?

His wisdom was such that he was\nable to unify the Nine Mountains schools of Korean Zen into a single order (the Chogye Order, still\nthe largest order of Korean Zen).\nHe was a prolific writer of essays, talks, and poetry. Here's a poem for your consideration:\nHow Can I Speak\nAll phenomena are beyond names and forms\nThe sounds of the streams and the colors of the mountains are closest\nWhat is closest?\nYou can only please yourself: how can I speak?\n61\nQuick pointers for each stage\nCommentary\nT'aego's poem has a teaching direction, with each line functioning as a koan (Korean: kong-an).\nHere are questions that might arise from this poem:\n1. What does \"all phenomena are beyond names and forms\" mean?\n2. What does \"the sounds of the streams and the colors of the mountains are closest\" mean?\n3. What is closest?\n4. How can you speak?\nIn the Korean Zen tradition, students are often asked to respond to specific questions about a case\nor story. Some of the questions have a \"wide gate,\" through which several types of answers might\npass. Others have a \"narrow gate,\" which would permit only a very precise answer.

I realize this at\nearlier stages can point out other stuff but here I think it can help dissolve the last vestiges of\nsomething that needs to be done and someone who needs to do something… or even “no or no\ngoal, no attainment”?-hale.)\nRegarding Zen Koans, here are some quotes from John Tan:\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nAdmin\n65\nQuick pointers for each stage\nOn zen koans, John Tan wrote in 2009,\n“Yes Emanrohe,\nThat is precisely the question asked by Dogen that “if our Buddha Nature is already perfect, why\npractice?” This question continues to bother him even after the initial glimpse and that led him to\nChina in search for the answer that eventually awaken his wisdom into the non-dual nature of\nAwareness.\nTherefore we must understand in Zen tradition, different koans were meant for different\npurposes. The experience derived from the koan “before birth who are you?” only allows an initial\nglimpse of our nature. It is not the same as the Hakuin’s koan of “what is the sound of one hand\nclapping?” The five categories of koan in Zen ranges from hosshin that give practitioner the first\nglimpse of ultimate reality to five-ranks that aims to awaken practitioner the spontaneous unity of\nrelative and absolute (non-duality). Only through thorough realization of the non-dual nature\n(spontaneous unity of relative and absolute) of Awareness can we then understand why there is\nno split between subject and object as well as seeing the oneness of realization and development.\nTherefore the practice of natural state is for those that have already awaken to their non-dual\nnature, not just an initial glimpse of Awareness. The difference must be clearly understood. It is\nnot for anyone and it is advisable that we refrain from talking too much about the natural state.\nThe 'natural' way is in fact the most challenging path, there is no short cut.\nOn the other hand, the gradual path of practice is a systematic way of taking us step by step until\nwe eventually experienced the full non-dual and non-local nature of pristine awareness. One way\nis by first firmly establishing the right view of anatta (non-dual) and dependent origination and\npractice vipassana or bare attention to authenticate our experience with the right view. The\ngradual paths are equally precious, that is the point I want to convey.\nLastly there is a difference between understanding Buddha Nature and God. Not to let our initial\nglimpse of pristine awareness overwhelmed us.\nEdited by Thusness 05 May `09, 10:35PM\n“\n- https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../thusnesss...\nAWAKENINGTOREALITY.COM\nThusness's Conversations Between 2004 to 2012\nThusness's Conversations Between 2004 to 2012\n• 9h\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\n66\nQuick pointers for each stage\nAdmin\nMore quotes on koan by JT from the past as I was explaining to someone:\nJohn Tan:\n“More by john tan:\nAlejandro, I would separate non-arisen and emptiness from the luminosity. Imo, it's a separate\npointing. The one hand clapping here directly points to the luminosity.\nWhat is the way that leads the practitioner to “the direct taste”? In zen, koan is the technique and\nthe way.\nThe one hand clapping koan is the instrument that leads one to directly and intuitively\nauthenticate presence = sound.\nLet’s use another koan for example, “Before birth who am I?”, this is similar to just asking “Who am\nI”. The “Before birth” here is to skilfully lead the thinking mind to penetrate to the limit of its own\ndepth and suddenly completely cease and rest, leaving only I-I. Only this I as pure existence itself.\nBefore birth, this I. After birth, this I. This life or 10 thousand lives before, this I. 10 thousand lives\nafter, still this I. The direct encounter of the I-I.\nSimilarly the koan of the sound of one hand clapping, is to lead the practitioner after initial break-\nthrough into I-I not to get stuck in dead water and attached to the Absolute. To direct practitioner\nto see the ten thousand faces of presence face to face. In this case, it is that “Sound” of one hand\nclapping.\nWhether one hand claps or before both hands clap, what is that sound? It attempts to lead the\npractitioner into just that “Sound”. All along there is only one hand clapping, two hands (duality)\nare not needed. It is similar to contemplating \"in hearing always only sound, no hearer\".\nAs for the empty and non-arisen nature of that Sound, zen koans have not (imo) been able to\neffectively point to the non-arisen and emptiness of one’s radiance clarity.”\no 34m\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nAdmin\nJT:\n“Liu Zhi Guan Zen koans relate more to the direct pointing of one's radiance clarity whereas mmk\nis about letting the mind sees its own fabrications and allowing it to free itself from all elaborations\n(non Gelug) or free itself from all fabrications (Gelug). The most crucial insight of both Gelug and\nnon Gelug (imo) is to let the mind realizes the primordial purity (emptiness) nature of both\nmind/phenomena.\nAlthough Mipham treated gelug's freedom from self nature as categorized ultimate, I can only tell\nyou I disagree.

I will not go too detailed\ninto that.\nIn short seeing through intrinsic existence will similarly allow practitioners to see through\nconceptual constructs (non-conceptualities), see through duality (non-dual) and substantiality\n(essencelessness). Phenomena lack of self-nature also lacks sameness or difference, therefore\ntheir primordially purity will likewise be realized and selflessness also results in natural\nspontaneity; yet because practitioners put freedom from self-nature at a higher order, they will\nnot be bounded by conceptualities and can embrace the conventional fully.”\no 33m\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nAdmin\nHaving said that john tan did deviced a “koan” as a pointer to emptiness:\n“Now is not a container to him but rather a ground for him to land.\nSay that there is\nShare with him the post about daniel's post on anatta and emptiness.\nThen say there is a related koan that I ask you to a direct taste of the emptiness of the \"here and\nnow\" but requires one to hv direct experience of non-dual presencing:\nAppreciate the vivid, lurid scenery in non-dual and ask,\nWhere is this scenery?”\n“André, to me \"no awareness\" in anatta is like telling us not to stop moving air to experience wind\nso that we can experience the blowing directly, effortlessly and naturally.\nDependent origination is to explain the conventional relationship between wind and moving air to\nestablish its validity conventionally and frees the inherent and dualistic rigidity.\nEmptiness is very special, it is a koan.\nThe convention \"wind\" is empty and non-arisen,\nWhat is that \"wind\"?\nWhy express that it originates in dependence and is empty and non-arisen?”\n•\n• Reply\n• 33m\n(On the last point: also see Daniel's Post on Anatta/Emptiness)\nHale:\nI love the pointers to draw out presence that I think could be used at most any stage is:\n68\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nAre you alive?

As for what attainment is not\nimportant. Many are confused with experience, view and the realization of view. Once you are clear, you\ncan sort out many issues and the mind can rest.” - John Tan, 2019\n“Dry non-conceptualities means PCE [pure consciousness experience] without insight and wisdom.\nWithout insight of how the conceptual mind affect experiences and wisdom of the nature of mind and\nphenomena.\nThere is the experiences, the view and the realization. So practice is not just about experiences, one must\nrealise clearly what the view of anatta and emptiness is pointing to in real-time experiences. Essentially it\nis about understanding how reification from conceptualities confuse the mind leading to dualistic and\ninherent thoughts and the freedom from them into spontaneous perfection of natural condition.” – John\nTan, 2020\n“4/12/2012 3:00 PM: John: Imo it is not possible to remove the sense of self by the path of practice alone,\nthe view and realization is important. Tilopa’s advice is only advisable after a practitioner realizes certain\nimportant aspect of the nature and essence of mind.That is what is meant by being 'natural'. What is the\ncause of contrived effort. It is easy to say the sense of self creates the 'efforting' but practitioner will need\nto have deeper insight then just saying that. Otherwise the mind is not willing to let go itself”\n\"The seven stages are not necessarily about attainments, although they are in a sense attainments. The\ncrucial point however is realisation. Without certain crucial realisations, there is no breakthrough. There\nmust be clarity about that.\n69\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nThe emphasis on AtR is on distinguishing and integrating view, experience and realization. Without clarity\non this, there will be obstructions. Too many practitioners emphasize on certain aspects - such as skewing\nto experience only, or on the view only, for example.\nEven to realise anatta is a dharma seal and not merely a state of no mind is rare, for example, and even\nthat is just a start and not an end.\nAlthough I should add: realisation in atr context isn’t divorced from view and experience especially in later\nstages.\nFor example as John Tan said before, realisation (of anatta, emptiness) just means direct realisation of\nright view so that the view does not remain intellectual. Its not so much as “no view”.\nSo to summarise: the crucial takeaway from atr is to have clarity on the view, realization and experience.\nNot so much to see the stages as a form of attainment. As a matter of fact the seventh stage stressed it\nshould be understood as ongoing “practice enlightenment” rather than a static finality.\" - Soh, 2020\n“What's important is realization. The 7 phases of realization as per JT map emphasizes the distinction of\nview, realization and experience. Realization is important for breakthrough.\nWith the correct realization comes the experience and possibility of stable and effortless experience of\npure presence in its nondual, uncontrived, full-blown, empty and liberating way. Most crucial key is the\nanatta realization, and with that mature into two-fold emptiness and spontaneous perfection and self-\nliberation.

From my understanding, no. This is because\nyou can be very deep in samadhi and practice, yet unable to have a very decisive breakthrough until\nrealization of anatman and emptiness, which requires right view. Before that you can rest in Presence-\nAwareness or Clarity, but it does not go beyond Vedanta. Ramana Maharshi sat all day and night for years\nand years in caves in Nirvikalpa Samadhi -- absorption in the Pure Awareness of Being, and never left his\nseat, only surviving due to devotees feeding him food. Likewise John Tan ('Thusness'), my mentor, spent\nmany years practicing Nirvikalpa Samadhi until his encounter with Buddhadharma led to his\nbreakthrough. He is reclusive and does not like attention of people much less be a teacher, but he felt\nindebted to Buddha and left some writings as helpful pointers to others.\nWithout deep insight into anatman and emptiness, there is still this subtle knot of perception, this karmic\npropensity that is the source of identity and dualism and samsara. That requires clear insight to break-\nthrough. So it is this insight that dissolves the bond, which years and years of samadhi could not. This is\nwhy someone who awakens via insight and wisdom 'outshines'. And Buddha is very clear on that.” – Soh,\n2020\n\"You have a mindstream, which is a continuum of consciousness, but this mindstream is an aggregated,\ncausal proliferation of discrete instances, much different than a fixed “soul” as an abiding entity.\nThe fetter of selfhood is the root of samsara, and as such, the conviction that you have a real self or soul\nis an obscuration. We do have a conventional identity or self that we can use in everyday life, but we\nsuffer when we mistake this identity as something truly real.\n“Right view” does involve a correct understanding of selfhood, the Ratnakūṭa Sūtra states:\nRight view (samyagdṛṣti) is the abandonment of the view of that the aggregates are a self (satkāyadṛṣti).\nAnd regarding the prospect of a self or soul apart from the aggregates, Vasubandhu states:\nThere is neither direct perception nor inference of a soul [ātman] independent of the aggregates\n[skandhas].

But you see so many [practitioners]\nare now talking about it [the realization of anatta] after going through all the different traditional\ntechniques.

What Candra disputes is not\nsyllogistic reasoning in its entirety, but rather, syllogistic reasoning applied to emptiness.\nLikewise, he clearly asserts the view in the VV that there is no svabhāva in phenomena.

So that\nexperience is fully open, direct, immediate and without boundaries. Chariot and its basis are not a cause\nand effect relationship, they originate in dependence.” - John Tan, 2019\n“The truth of the matter is that “pacification of views” is directly related to the realization of emptiness. If\nyou have not realized emptiness, then you have no business talking about a lack of view, because you still\nperceive conditioned phenomena and are therefore cognitively endowed with “views.” Those views can\nonly be pacified through directly realizing non-arising.\nFor some reason you mistakenly believe that “no view” means something like withholding a view, but it\nhas nothing at all to do with that.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\nKrodha's more recent/most updated post on this matter in 2023:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/162teze/what_is_the_phrase_the_right_view_is_no_view/\n“What is the Phrase the ‘Right View’ is ‘No View’? : Buddhism (reddit.com)\nlevel 1\nkrodha\n·\n19 min. ago\nOn the “absence of views”:\nAn “absence of view” does not imply a refusal to engage in concepts, or choosing to remain indifferent\nand neutral, not taking a position so that one has “no views.”\n75\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nThe actual meaning of abandoning “all views” [sarvadṛṣṭi] is defined in the Ārya-mahāyānopadeśa-nāma-\nmahāyāna-sūtra, which states:\nAbandoning all views is entering into the middle way, seeing all dharmas as equal.\nThe “equality of dharmas” is directly related to the absence of characteristics [alakṣaṇa] that is revealed in\nthe realization of emptiness [śūnyatā]. The Āryākṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā describes the interrelation of these\naspects of awakened insight:\nThe descriptions from the element of self [atmadhātu] up to the element of all phenomena [sarvadharmadhātu]\nare the nature of one taste in the ultimate dharmadhātu, emptiness. Since individual characteristics do not\nexist, all phenomena said to be \"equivalent\" since they are undifferentiated.\nTherefore to actualize the “abandonment of views” one must realize emptiness, and through realizing\nemptiness, the absence of characteristics is directly known due to the absence of a would be inherent\nnature or “svabhāva” to possesses said characteristics. At that time, because entities are realized to be\nnon-arisen, the basis of imputation which was previously mistaken to be an object endowed with specific\ncharacteristics is recognized to be a heterogeneous array of appearances that do not actually constitute\nor create the entity they were previously misconstrued to characterize. In the absence of an entity,\nexistence and non-existence, having no substantial referent, are undone and as a result all views (and\ncharacteristics) are exhausted.\nIn his Mūlamadhyamakakārika, Nāgārjuna clarifies that the pacification of views is contingent upon insight\ninto emptiness whereby existent entities that are capable of existing and/or lacking existence are\nrecognized to be unfounded. He likewise chastises those of “little intelligence” who assert otherwise:\nSome of small intelligence, see existents in terms of “is” or “is not”; they do not perceive the pacification of views,\nor peace.\n“Peace” here again is intended to illustrate an absence of characteristics, the Ārya-\ntathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:\n\"Nirvana is peace\" denotes actualizing the absence of characteristics.\nCandrakīrti concurs in his Madhyamakāvatāra:\nThe absence of all characteristics is peace.\nWe can understand “peace” and “pacification” in general to be the import of such statements. The\npacification of characteristics and therefore the pacification of views, resulting from an awakened and\nexperiential knowledge of the nature of phenomena, emptiness free from extremes, the Aṣṭasāhasrikā-\nprajñāpāramitā sūtra states:\nWhat is called \"knowledge of all things\" is the result of knowing one thing: the true nature of phenomena, which\nhas the attribute of peace.\n76\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nThe only means to obtain “peace” is via the awakened insight that ascertains the absence of a core entity\nwhich possesses characteristics, the untenability of selfhood and the associated implications of a self.\nThe Samādhirāja Sūtra states:\nIf the selflessness of phenomena is analyzed, and if this analysis is cultivated, it causes the effect of attaining\nnirvana. Through no other cause does one come to peace.\nOne may ask, how is such an insight possible? It is possible because all phenomena are innately empty\nand devoid of a svabhāva that possesses characteristics, however ignorance and affliction obscure that\nfact. The purpose of applying the dharma is to discover that hidden nature of phenomena that is always\nalready the case, but is concealed by our delusion. The Ārya-kāśyapa-parivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra is\nclear that emptiness and an absence of characteristics are innate attributes which only need be\nrecognized:\nKāśyapa, moreover, the true discernment into dharmas of the middle way is not making dharmas empty with\nemptiness, dharmas themselves are empty; it is not making dharmas without characteristics with the absence of\ncharacteristics; dharmas themselves lack characteristics.\nIt is only our affliction which causes us to perceive entities that are endowed with characteristics, when in\nactuality no such entities have ever originated in the first place. The realization of emptiness is\nsimultaneously the antidote to those afflictions, and the means by which the absence of characteristics is\nascertained. The Play of Noble Mañjūśrī Sūtra states:\nAfflictions are temporary, they cannot simultaneous with the realization of emptiness; they cannot simultaneous\nwith the knowledge of the absence of characteristics and the absence of aspiration; they cannot simultaneous\nwith natural luminosity.\nNāgārjuna states in his Lokātītastava:\nYou [the tathāgata] taught that those who do not realize that characteristics do not exist are not liberated.\nAnd in closing it is important to bear in mind that because the referent to lack characteristics is\nexhausted, even the absence of characteristics is ultimately absent as a characteristic.\nThe Anantamukhapariśodhananirdeśaparivarta states:\nAlthough the teachings conventionally refer to “the essence and nature of all phenomena,” phenomena are\nactually devoid of an inherent essence or a nature. The inherent nature of things is that they are empty and lack\nan essence. All that is empty and devoid of an essence has a single [generic] characteristic: since phenomena are\ndevoid of [specific] characteristics, their [generic] characteristic is complete purity, and thus by definition there is\nnothing to label as empty or essenceless. Since by definition there is nothing to label as empty or essenceless, no\nphenomena can, by definition, be labeled.\nBhāviveka states in his Tarkajvālā:\nWhen that yogin dwells in the experience of nonconceptual discerning wisdom [prajñā] and experiences\nnonduality, at that time, ultimately, the entire reality of objects are as follows, of the same characteristics, like\n77\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nspace, appearing in the manner of a nonappearance since their characteristics are nonexistent, therefore, there\nisn’t even the slightest thing that is not empty, so where could there be emptiness?”\n“As of now - Year 2019, about 12 years after the John/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment was first\nwritten by John, more than 30 people have realised anatta through encountering the blog, myself or John.\nI am glad that the blog and articles have been of a positive impact to the spiritual community, and I'm\nconfident that it will continue to be of benefit to many more seekers in years to come.\nIt has come to my attention after all these years that despite the clear descriptions by John above, the John\n7 Stages of insights are very often misapprehended. This is why further clarifications and elaborations are\nnecessary.\nDo refer to these articles for more commentaries by John on the 7 stages:\nDifference Between John Tan/Thusness Stage 1 and 2 and other Stages\nBuddha Nature is NOT \"I Am\"\nWrong Interpretation of I AM as Background\nDifference Between John Tan/Thusness Stage 4 and 5 (Substantial Non-duality vs Anatta)\nTwo Types of Nondual Contemplation after I AM (On How to Realize Anatta)\nAdvice for Taiyaki (Pointers for Post-Anatta Contemplation)\n+A and -A Emptiness (On the two experiential insights involved in John Tan/Thusness Stage 6)\nFor more pointers on how to investigate and contemplate to attain each of those realizations above, see\nBook Recommendations 2019 and Practice Advise\nIt is important to note that it is common to have certain insights into no-self, impersonality and non-\ndoership, and yet it is not the same as the insight of John Tan/Thusness Stage 5 or even John Tan/Thusness\nStage 4, as discussed in Non-Doership is Not Yet Anatta Realization. If you think you realised Anatta or Stage\n5, make sure to check out this article, as it is often very common to mistaken non-doership, substantialist\nnon-duality or even a state of no-mind for the insight of anatta: Different Degress of No-Self: Non-Doership,\nNon-dual, Anatta, Total Exertion and Dealing with Pitfalls\nFurthermore, another common mistake is to think that the peak experience of no-mind (where any trace\nor sense of being a subject/perceiver/self/Self behind experience temporarily dissolves and what's left is\nsimply 'just experience' or 'just the vivid colors/sounds/scents/taste/touch/thought) is similar to the anatta\n'dharma-seal' insight/realization of John Tan/Thusness Stage 5. It is not the same. It is common to have an\nexperience, but rare to have realization. Yet it is the realization of anatta that stabilizes the experience, or\nmakes it effortless. For example, in my case, after the realization of anatta has arisen and stabilized, I do\nnot have the slightest trace or sense of subject/object division or agency for about 9 years, till now, and\nJohn Tan reports the same for the past 20+ years (he realised anatta in 1997 and overcame the trace of\n78\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nbackground in a year or so). It should be noted that overcoming subject/object division and agency (which\nhappens even at Thusness Stage 5) does not mean other subtler obscurations are eliminated -- the\ncomplete elimination of this is full Buddhahood (a topic that is discussed in Traditional Buddhist Attainments:\nArahantship and Buddhahood chapter in Awakening to Reality: A Guide to the Nature of Mind). That is natural\nafter realization sinks in to replace the old paradigm or conditioned ways of perception, it's a bit like figuring\nout a picture puzzle and never unseeing it again. However this does not indicate an end or finality to practice,\nor the attainment of Buddhahood. Practice still goes on, it simply becomes dynamic and condition-based\nas stated in Stage 7, even Stage 7 is not a finality. This topic is discussed further in No Mind and Anatta,\nFocusing on Insight. It is also common to fall into the disease of non-conceptuality, mistaking that as the\nsource of liberation and thus clinging to or seeking a state of non-conceptuality as the main object of\npractice, whereas liberation comes only through the dissolving of ignorance and views (of subject/object\nduality, and inherent existence) that cause reification, by insight and realization. (See: The Disease of Non-\nConceptuality) It is true that reification is conceptual. But merely training to be non-conceptual is simply\nsuppressing the symptoms while not treating the cause - ignorance (resting in non-conceptual presencing\nis important as part of meditative training but must go along with wisdom [insight into anatta, dependent\norigination and emptiness] as the natural ongoing actualization of anatta). For non-reification leads to non-\nconceptuality but non-conceptuality itself does not lead to non-reified perception.\nSo when insights into anatta, D.O. [dependent origination] and emptiness are realized and actualized,\nperception is naturally non-reified and non-conceptual. Furthermore we must see the empty and non-\narising nature of all phenomena from the perspective of dependent origination. John wrote in 2014, \"Be it\nBuddha himself, Nagarjuna or Tsongkhapa, none [of them] never got overwhelmed and amazed with the\nprofundity of dependent origination. It is just that we do not have the wisdom to penetrate enough depth\nof it.\" and \"Actually if you do not see Dependent Origination, you do not see Buddhism [i.e. the essence of\nBuddhadharma]. Anatta is just the beginning.\"\n“John TanThursday, August 21, 2014 at 6:36am UTC+08\nI am not into no view… but actualization of right view.\nJohn TanThursday, August 21, 2014 at 7:03am UTC+08\nWe all know views are only provisional and are approximate of \"reality\" but some views are better\nrepresentations of \"reality\" than others.

It is the no practice and unskillful\npresentation of the ultimate, ignoring two truths and seeing everything as conceptual designation is a\nnightmare. Phenomena are only realized to be absence and empty when sought and analyzed via\ndependent arising, otherwise it is amazingly real and vivid. No matter how direct, non-dual and non-\nconceptual, no experience survives ultimate analysis, when analyze always non-arisen and empty.

We must infer for non-conceptuality cannot bring us\nto that realization...there it is conceptual + non-conceptual to \"awake\" this insight of absence while in\n80\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nvivid presence. What most practitioner missed is they hold too tightly to non-conceptuality and therefore\nare denied of this realization. We then bring this taste to the entire scenery and ask where is this\nscenery… it must be in a non-dual of just scenery to bring this actual taste upon one's own empty clarity…\nthen the whole entire experience turns illusion-like. Then we bring this to the more insubstantial\nphenomena like sound, sensation, scent...just one's empty clarity...

However one\nshould not \"follow\" and energize conceptualizing in practice. That is a universal Buddhist Dharma.\nWithout that cessation of conceptualizing, samsara continues no matter what \"you\" realized.\nYesterday at 4:19pm · Like · 1\nKyle Dixon: In the absence of recognition, following or not-following conceptualization truly makes no\ndifference due to the presence of affliction, which dominates one's experience either way.\nConceptualization's cause (and foundation for proliferation) is delusion, so yes I agree that cause must be\nexhausted (i.e. the delusion of non-recognition must be resolved via the wisdom of recognition).\nUltimately conceptualization is the adulteration of vāyu (Tib. rlung) functioning in the body, and that being\nthe case, 'conceptualization' i.e. imputation (in it's proliferating and perpetual form) arises through non-\n83\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nrecognition, whereby it is then sustained by the compounded interweaving of habitual tendencies (and\nkarmic propensities). It's rampant presence in most people's condition is actually an imbalance which can\nbe calmed via practices such as śamatha (Tib. shiné), but even in balancing that energy (which results in\nthe 'calm abiding' associated with a successful implementation of śamatha) the affliction which is the root\ncause of imputation remains unpacified. Therefore vipaśyanā is still required (as I know you've\nmentioned), but that vipaśyanā must be the undeluded insight of vidyā (rig pa), otherwise the\nfundamental cause of conceptualization is unresolved no matter how stable one's śamatha is. There are\npractitioners who claim to be able to remain without thought for extremely long periods of time, and\nthat's all well and good, but that absence of conceptualization doesn't mean avidyā (ma rig pa) has been\nrectified, nor does it mean the ālaya (Tib. kun gzhi) has been pacified.\nTherefore it isn't simply conceptualization which must end for samsara to fall, the entire foundation for\nconceptualization, mind, consciousness etc., must be severed, which is the ignorance of non-recognition.\nConceptualization is indeed the direct ignorance which sets the 12 Nidānas of dependent origination into\nmotion (and sustains them), however, conceptualization itself is the compounded result of preceding\nignorance. Ergo, the mere suspension, pacification or cessation of conceptualization itself will not do the\njob, avidyā remains potent in the form of the latent traces which forego imputation. Only prajñā and vidyā\ncan resolve the ignorance responsible.\nI don't think anyone is suggesting that conceptualization is appropriate in practice nor is anyone\nsuggesting that conceptualization is synonymous with practice. However, conceptualization is very\nappropriate (and necessary) while discussing the dharma in a group forum online.\nYesterday at 5:26pm · Like · 1\nLogan Truthe: Neylug Rangjung tantra:\nIf the forever-present primordial wisdom of the dharmakaya is not realized even though you have\npracticed achieving stability in this profound path in the very state of conscious awareness free of\nconceptual elaboration, as soon as you pass away from this life, there are forces to propel you to the\nform realm and the formless realm; but with this alone it is impossible to achieve omniscient\nbuddhahood.\nYesterday at 6:31pm · Edited · Unlike · 2”\nIt is also necessary to understand that the 7 stages are not rankings of 'importance', but are simply the\norder of how certain insights unfolded in John's journey, although I too have gone through the stages in\npretty much the same order. Each realization in the John 7 Stages is important and precious. The realization\nof 'I AMness' should not be seen as being 'less important' or 'arbitrary' when compared with the realization\nof emptiness, and I often tell people to start with or go through the I AMness realization to bring out the\naspect of luminosity first (for some others, this aspect will only be obvious in later phases of practice). Or\nas John said in the past, we should \"see all as important insights to release the deep karmic conditioning\nso that clarity becomes effortless, uncontrived, free and liberating.\" The phases of realizations may not\nnecessarily arise in the same order or linear way for each person, and one may need to cycle through the\ninsights a couple of times for 'deepening' (see: Are the insight stages strictly linear?) Furthermore, as John\nsaid, \"The anatta I realized is quite unique. It is not just a realization of no-self. But it must first have an\n84\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nintuitive insight of Presence. Otherwise will have to reverse the phases of insights\" (see: Anatta and Pure\nPresence)\nAnd as John wrote before, \"Hi Mr. J, Despite all differences we may have about lower yanas, no practices\nneeded, Absolute… I really appreciate your zealous attempt to bring this message into view and I agree with\nyou wholeheartedly on this aspect of “transmission”. If one truly wants this essence to be “transmitted”,\nhow can it be otherwise? For what that is to be passed is truly of different dimension, how can it be\nadulterated with words and forms? The ancient teachers are extremely serious observing and waiting for\nthe right condition to pass the essence unreservedly and wholeheartedly. So much so that when the\nessence is transmitted, it must boil the blood and penetrate deep into the bone marrow. The entire body-\nmind must become one opening eye. Once open, everything turns “spirit”, mind intellect drops and what’s\nleft is aliveness and intelligence everywhere! Mr. J, I sincerely hope you well, just don’t leave trace in the\nAbsolute. Gone!\"\nAlso, it is very important to understand that having a conceptual understanding of no-self, dependent\norigination and emptiness is very different from direct realization. As I told Mason Spransy in The\nImportance of Luminosity, it is very possible to have the conceptual understanding of Thusness Stage 6 but\nlacking in direct realization. Days after that conversation he had certain breakthrough (see: Suchness /\nMason Spransy). As Thusness pointed out in Purpose of Madhyamaka, if after all the analysis and\ncontemplations of Madhyamaka (Buddhist emptiness teachings taught by Nagarjuna) one is unable to\nrealize that the mundane is precisely where one's natural radiance is fully expressed, a separate pointing\nis necessary.\nMany may wonder, why the need for so many phases of insights? Is there a way to reach liberation instantly?\nSome people find all these stages and information to be overly complex. Isn't truth something that is direct\nand simple? For the fortunate few (or perhaps, someone of 'higher capacity'), like Bahiya of the Bark Cloth,\nthey were able to attain liberation immediately upon hearing a single verse of Dhamma/Dharma from the\nBuddha. For the majority of us, there is a process of uncovering truth and penetrating our thick layers of\ndelusions. It is very common to get stuck at a phase of realization and think that one has reached a finality\n(even in earlier phases like John Tan/Thusness Stage 1), but are still unable to dissolve subtle identities and\nreification that cause clinging, thus preventing liberation. If one is able to penetrate by insight and dissolve\nall self/Self/identities/reifications at once, one may be liberated on the spot. But if (most likely the case) one\ndoes not have this capacity to penetrate all delusions at once, further pointings and phases of insights are\nnecessary. As John said, \"Although Joan Tollifson spoke of the natural non-dual state as something “so\nsimple, so immediate, so obvious, so ever-present that we often overlook”, we have to understand that to\neven come to this realization of the “Simplicity of What Is”, a practitioner will need to undergo a painstaking\nprocess of de-constructing the mental constructs. We must be deeply aware of the ‘blinding spell’ in order\nto understand consciousness. I believe Joan must have gone through a period of deep confusions, not to\nunder-estimate it. :)\" (Excerpt from: Three Paradigms with Nondual Luminosity)\n85\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nFor, as John Tan said before, “Though buddha nature is plainness and most direct, these are still the\nsteps. If one does not know the process and said ‘yes this is it’… then it is extremely misleading. For 99\npercent [of ‘realized’/’enlightened’ persons] what one is talking about is \"I AMness\", and has not gone\nbeyond permanence, still thinking [of] permanence, formless… ...all and almost all will think of it along the\nline of \"I AMness\", all are like the grandchildren of \"AMness\", and that is the root cause of duality.” - John\nTan, 2007\nThe stages are like a raft, it’s for the purpose of crossing over, it’s for the purpose of giving up our delusions\nand clinging, rather than for clinging on as some sort of dogma. It is a skillful means to guide seekers to\nrealise their nature of mind and to point out the pitfalls and blindspots. Once realized, all the insights are\nactualized moment to moment and one no longer thinks about stages, and neither will one hold onto an\nideation of having an attainment nor an attainer, nor somewhere else to get to. The whole luminous field\nof display is simply zero-dimensional suchness, empty and non-arisen. In other words, once the raft or\nladder has served its purpose, it is left aside rather than carried up the shore. As John wrote in 2010, \"In\nactuality, there is no ladder or no 'no self' whatsoever. Just this breath, this passing scent, this arising sound.\nNo expression can be clearer then this/these obviousness. Plain and Simple!\" But what John said here is\nreferring to the post-anatta-realization actualization. It is easy induce a state of no-mind experience -- for\nexample there are many stories about Zen masters giving a completely unexpected blow, a shout, a pinch\non your nose out of a sudden, and in that moment of pain and shock, all sense of self and indeed all\nconcepts are completely forgotten and only the vivid pain remains. This can induce what we call an\nexperience of no-mind (a peak experience of no-self/no-subject) but should not be mistaken as the\nrealization of anatta. However, anatta realization is what makes no-mind into an effortless natural state.\nMost of those teachers who have access to nondual experience that I’ve seen only express a state of no-\nmind but not the realization of anatta. As mentioned earlier, this topic is discussed further in No Mind and\nAnatta, Focusing on Insight and the fourth point of Realization and Experience and Non-Dual Experience\nfrom Different Perspectives. Hence, until the 7 phases are realized and actualized, the map is still very\nuseful.\nJohn also wrote many years ago commenting on someone discussing Dzogchen practice as the realization\nof the luminous essence and integrating it into all experience and activities, \"I understand what he meant\nand but the way it is taught (Soh: i.e. discussed by the person) is misleading. It is simply non-dual experience\nand experiencing presence in both the foreground and background and in the 3 states (Soh: waking,\ndreaming, dreamless deep sleep). That is not realizing our true empty nature but our luminous\nessence... ...understand the difference between luminosity and empty nature (Soh: luminosity here refers to\nthe aspect of Presence-Awareness, and emptiness refers to the lack of intrinsic existence or essence of\nPresence/Self/Phenomena)... ...Very often, people rely on the experience and not true realization of the view.\nThe right view (Soh: of anatta (no-self), dependent origination and emptiness) is like a neutralizer that\nneutralizes dualistic and inherent views; by itself, there is nothing to hold. So realize what right view is\npointing and all experiences will come naturally. The right enlightenment experience is like what (Zen\nMaster) Dogen described, not merely a non-dual state where experiencer and what's experienced collapses\ninto a non-dual stream of experience. This I have told you clearly.\"\n86\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\nLastly, I'll end with something John wrote in 2012, \"You cannot talk about emptiness and liberation without\ntalking about awareness. Instead understand the empty nature of awareness and see awareness as this\nsingle activity of manifestation. I do not see practice apart from realizing the essence and nature of\nawareness. The only difference is seeing Awareness as an ultimate essence or realizing awareness as this\nseamless activity that fills the entire Universe. When we say there is no scent of a flower, the scent is the\nflower.... that is because the mind, body, universe are all together deconstructed into this single flow, this\nscent and only this... Nothing else. That is the Mind that is no mind. There is not an Ultimate Mind that\ntranscends anything in the Buddhist enlightenment. The mind Is this very manifestation of total exertion...\nwholly thus. Therefore there is always no mind, always only this vibration of moving train, this cooling air\nof the air-con, this breath... The question is after the 7 phases of insights can this be realized and\nexperienced and becomes the ongoing activity of practice in enlightenment and enlightenment in practice\n-- practice-enlightenment.\"\nAlso, he wrote in 2012, \"Has awareness stood out? There is no concentration needed. When six entries and\nexits are pure and primordial, the unconditioned stands shining, relaxed and uncontrived, luminous yet\nempty. The purpose of going through the 7 phases of perception shift is for this... Whatever arises is free\nand uncontrived, that is the supreme path. Whatever arises has never left their nirvanic state... ... your\ncurrent mode of practice [after those experiential insights] should be as direct and uncontrived as possible.\nWhen you see nothing behind and magical appearances are too empty, awareness is naturally lucid and\nfree. Views and all elaborations dissolved, mind-body forgotten... just unobstructed awareness. Awareness\nnatural and uncontrived is supreme goal. Relax and do nothing, Open and boundless, Spontaneous and\nfree, Whatever arises is fine and liberated, This is the supreme path. Top/bottom, inside/outside, Always\nwithout center and empty (2-fold emptiness), Then the view is fully actualized and all experiences are great\nliberation.\" In 2014, he said, \"All 7 phases of insight can be realized and experienced, they are not verbiage.\nBut perfection in terms of actualization in everyday life requires refining our view, meeting situations and\ndedication of quality time in anatta and total exertion. The problem is many do not have the discipline and\nperseverance.\"\n“You have to distinguish between seeing \"inseparability\" of clarity and emptiness from seeing clarity alone.\nThat is when Mipham is talking about clarity, he is referring to empty clarity which is not the same as seeing\nClarity as ultimate. Like when I tell you awareness is natural and free, it does not mean there is another\nextra awareness other than sound, thoughts, sensations, colors, smells… In other words, there is ongoing\nawaring in the form of sound, sensations, hardness, softness, coldness, emotions… etc. No awareness… As\nsuch we have the issue of saying it cannot be said to be clarity nor other than clarity. To refine and have\ndeeper insight of clarity, therefore requires a paradigm shift. Nothing is being transformed from this to\nthat. Rather it is under what condition, this arises. And understand dependent arising is non-arisen to\nrealize the nature of clarity/phenomena.” - John Tan, 2015\nSoh wrote to someone after his realization of anatta,\n87\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\n“I see, that means your insight into the two stanzas of anatta should be clear without going much into the\naspect of view. For now you need to spend quality time everyday to actualize anatta in its pristine purity\nand luminosity in all sense fields (or better yet, all senses are a seamless exertion of one formation) until it\nstabilizes (or rather the traces of self/Self gets released through practice).\nHaving quality each time actualizing the equipoise of anatta everyday (means like just sitting, zazen, or just\ndoing/acting/walking/etc, without relying on concepts and thoughts), just naked awareness empty of\nself/Self, fully open, centerless and boundless as vivid manifestation and total exertion.\nHowever post-equipoise, you should contemplate and integrate the right view of emptiness. That requires\nthoughts initially.\nThat is to say, for further progression you will also need to understand and realize the view of emptiness,\nand reading these two articles by Kyle Dixon may help for a start as he was able to have certain realization\ninto the view aspect along with his anatta insight from the beginning -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../a-sun-that... and https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../advise-\nfrom...\nThe second article mentions about the h2o analogy with a link to a ted talk.\nThese articles will help you and prevent the desync of view and experience that John Tan warned earlier.\nAs John Tan said about 2 months back, \"For Kyle, due to his view in emptiness, the experiential insight of\nanatta not only pierce through the self/Self but also triggered the arising insight of emptiness. However this\nmay not be true (imo) in most cases if one's view isn't firmly established. For me when I first encountered\nthe chariot analogy, there is an immediate and intuitive recognition that it is referring to anatta but I am\nunable to grasp the essence of the phrase \"emptiness and non-arisen\" there and then.\nIn other words, in addition to self immolation, a specific insight must arise, it is the prajna that clearly sees\nthrough the referent is empty and non-arisen. So anatta I would say is about severing the self/Self whereas\nphase 6 is the blossoming of this specific insight. Extending this insight from self to phenomena, from\nconventions to magical appearances is then a natural progression.\"\n....\n5/21/2012 12:37 PM: John: Not exactly...that is experience...what is important is to realize what the YouTube\nabout h2o then the willingness to drop the inherent view becomes natural. Coupled with the direct\nexperience of anatta and luminosity, experience will turn illusionary naturally but in a different light.\n88\nImportance of View, Realization and Experience\n5/21/2012 12:38 PM: John: How is contemplating on illusion like phenomena lead one to such realization\nand not substantial non dualism\n5/21/2012 12:41 PM: Soh Wei Yu: Oic. Yes I think advaita also talk about illusory but returns to substantial\n5/21/2012 12:44 PM: John: Over intellectualizing is no good without a good balance of direct experience.\nRight view then non conceptual direct experience of what the view is pointing.

So its more like seeing the aggregates as manifesting dependently? Btw\nwhat do you think about the blog I sent u\n6/1/2012 8:37 AM: John: The blog is good but have the same issue. Unless there is clarity of all these insights,\nthere will be no break-through in terms of stability and effortlessness of experience.\n6/1/2012 8:38 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. But he understands d.o. too?\n6/1/2012 8:40 AM: John: It is like going through the insight of anatta, you understand why a practitioner\nstruggles through getting himself non-dual and effortlessness in no-mind. A non-dual substantialist will tell\nyou how effortless non-dual is and how stable he is in that state but only a practitioner knows the limitation.\n...\n6/9/2012 9:30 PM: John: I have told you about the disease of non conceptuality, you need to seek a balance.\nOtherwise it will limit your progress into phase 6 and especially 7. View must be fully integrated into your\npractice for you to understand what the maha experience is\n6/9/2012 9:33 PM: Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. Maha is like everything is seamlessly interconnected as this very arising\nright, its not like one thing interacting with other (which would have segmented experience subtly), but that\neverything is integrated in one interconnected suchness\n6/9/2012 9:40 PM: John: Many do not understand the implication of right view yet. You do not go non\nconceptual and realize the maha experience of suchness. It is just like how dualistic and inherent view has\nintegrated into our moment to moment of experience. And we feel and behave as if the world is really dual.\nIf a practitioner is simply at \"in hearing, only sound and no hearer\", he can still get stuck at no self and\nsimply be awed by the grandeur of the pce. This is different from understanding the emptiness of self.\n89\nPractice Guide and Commentary\nUnderstanding \"emptiness\" requires you to understand the analogy given by the h2o YouTube and more.\nIt also requires to penetrate into dependent origination by deeper investigation of the nature of experience.\nWhere does sound go? Is there a \"going, coming\", is there a \"here and there\" of sound, is there a voidness\nwhere sound return to? Then what does it mean by \"no going anywhere\" and seeing DO. Then we begin\nto understand the view of activities and actions and when we see everywhere the seamless integration\nand total exertions, then maha experience will become more and more obvious and effortless. At this\nphase there is no self, no dual... All these are already implied...\nThere are the content of emptiness\nYou should look at few aspects\n1. Seeing inherent object as a mere convention collating ... If a practitioner keeps penetrating whatever\narises this way, experience will turn groundless and illusion -like\n2. Seeing clearly in non dual mode but deep in us realize that this is merely a dependent originated\nmanifestation, nothing ultimate and solidly real\n3. You see \"no going, no coming, no here, no there\" and penetrate deeply into the seamless\ninterpenetration of activities leading to the maha experience\nUntil this empty nature of whatever arises is intuited in our moment to moment of experience, you can\nthen feel the total exertion and self liberating aspect of experience”\nPractice Guide and Commentary\n“When there is simply a pure sense of existence;\nWhen awareness appears mirror like;\nWhen sensations become pristine clear and bright;\nThis is Luminosity.\nWhen all arising appear disconnected;\nWhen appearance springs without a center;\nWhen phenomena appears to be on their own without controller;\n90\nPractice Guide and Commentary\nThis is No Doer-ship.\nWhen subject/object division is seen as illusion;\nWhen there is clarity that no one is behind thoughts;\nWhen there is only scenery, sounds, thoughts and so forth;\nThis is Anatta.\nWhen phenomena appears pristinely crystal;\nWhen there is merely one seamless experience;\nWhen all is seen as presence;\nThis is Non-dual Presence.\nWhen we feel fully the unfindability and unlocatability of phenomena;\nWhen all experiences are seen as ungraspable;\nWhen all mind boundaries of in/out, there/here, now/then dissolve;\nThis is Emptiness.\nWhen interconnectedness of everything is wholly felt;\nWhen arising appears great, effortless and wonderful;\nWhen presence feels universe;\nThis is Maha.\nWhen arising is not caged in who, where and when;\nWhen all phenomena appear spontaneous and effortless;\nWhen everything appears right every where, every when;\nThis is Spontaneous Perfection.\nSeeing these as the ground of all experiences;\nAlways and already so;\nThis is Wisdom.\nExperiencing the ground in whatever arises;\n91\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThis is Practice.\nHappy journey.\" - John Tan, 2009\nThe practice guide and commentary written and compiled by The Awakening to Reality team begins here.\nA daily meditation practice is important regardless of where you are in practice. I highly\nrecommend watching this and practicing it diligently:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/12/rinzai-zen-at-korinji-why-do-we-sit-in.html\nWarning: it is my experience that after every breakthrough, there is a risk of encountering energy\nimbalances which may be problematic and painful. I have heard of people encountering these\nproblems after Stage 1, Stage 4, Stage 5, it also occurs before any stages happen, and it can happen\nat any phase or stage. But usually occurs soon after a breakthrough. You can dramatically reduce\nthe risk of facing such problems if you read the chapter on Energy Imbalances and know how to\nnavigate and practice correctly to avoid and mitigate such issues. Even if you face such problems,\nthe duration and intensity of these problems will be dramatically reduced and will usually subside\nin a week (it can last much longer without the correct pointers). You should not need to worry\nabout these, because as Angelo Dillulo (author of ‘Awake: It's Your Turn’) said, “I think many people\nsimply don’t talk about it bc they don’t want to dissuade others from the path. I generally lean that way\nbc by the time you’ve had awakening there is a deep knowing that although all this is going on it’s ok\nand will ultimately work itself out. But from the point of view of someone with a lot of psychological\nsuffering they might think “why in the world would I add all that pain to my experience, no thanks.” But\nthat’s a skewed view before awakening.”, ”during retreats I really try to emphasize the integrative as\nwell as the disintegrative and offer a balanced approach in the talks, guided meditations etc\n(energetically speaking). The feedback I get suggests it helps. The energy imbalances I see in retreatants\nis minimal compared to what I went through in Zen sesshin, and they still wake up, even non-dual isn’t\nuncommon and honestly I think it’s even faster for the balancing effect. “Middle way” seems to have a\nlot of merit. ” ☺️”\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“Practice is not about explanations and mental thoughts, first the eye that is awareness itself must be open.” – John Tan\nThe realization:\nA direct touch and realization of the Heart of one’s Existence, a pure Certainty of Being, pure doubtless\nExistence, doubtless certainty and realization of one’s existence being a formless yet undeniably obvious\nPresence-Awareness rather than mind and body.

This is also the First Stage of the Five Ranks of Tozan Ryokai (a Zen\nBuddhism map of awakening), called \"The Apparent within the Real\".\n“It was about 20 years back and it all started with the question of “Before birth, who am I?” I do not know\nwhy but this question seemed to capture my entire being. I could spend days and nights just sitting focusing,\npondering over this question; till one day, everything seemed to come to a complete standstill, not even a\nsingle thread of thought arose. There was merely nothing and completely void, only this pure sense of\nexistence. This mere sense of I, this Presence, what was it? It was not the body, not thought as there was\nno thought, nothing at all, just Existence itself. There was no need for anyone to authenticate this\nunderstanding.” - John, 2006, ‘Thusness Stage 1’ description in\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html\n“Hi Mr. H,\nIn addition to what you wrote, I hope to convey another dimension of Presence to you. That is\nEncountering Presence in its first impression, unadulterated and full blown in stillness.\nSo after reading it, just feel it with your entire body-mind and forgot about it. Don't let it corrupt your\nmind.\nPresence, Awareness, Beingness, Isness are all synonyms. There can be all sorts of definitions but all these\nare not the path to it. The path to it must be non-conceptual and direct. This is the only way.\nWhen contemplating the koan \"before birth who am I\", the thinking mind attempts to seek into its memory\nbank for similar experiences to get an answer. This is how the thinking mind works - compare, categorize\nand measure in order to understand.\nHowever, when we encounter such a koan, the mind reaches its limit when it tries to penetrate its own\ndepth with no answer. There will come a time when the mind exhausts itself and come to a complete\nstandstill and from that stillness comes an earthshaking BAM!\nI. Just I.\nBefore birth this I, a thousand years ago this I, a thousand later this I. I AM I.\nIt is without any arbitrary thoughts, any comparisons. It fully authenticates its own clarity, its own existence,\nITSELF in clean, pure, direct non-conceptuality. No why, no because.\nJust ITSELF in stillness nothing else.\n93\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIntuit the vipassana and the samantha. Intuit the total exertion and realization. The essence of message\nmust be raw and uncontaminated by words.\nHope that helps!” - John Tan, 2019\nKen Wilber on I AMness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8tDzK_kPI\n“If you would free yourself of the sufferings of samsara, you must learn the direct way to become a\nBuddha. This way is no other than the realization of your own Mind. Now what is this Mind? It is the true\nnature of all sentient beings, that which existed before our parents were born and hence before our own\nbirth, and which presently exists, unchangeable and eternal. So it is called one’s Face before one’s parents\nwere born. This Mind is intrinsically pure. When we are born it is not newly created, and when we die it\ndoes not perish. It has no distinction of male or female, nor has it any coloration of good or bad. It cannot\nbe compared with anything, so it is called Buddha-nature. Yet countless thoughts issue from this Self-\nnature as waves arise in the ocean or as images are reflected in a mirror.\nTo realize your own Mind you must first of all look into the source from which thoughts flow. Sleeping and\nworking, standing and sitting, profoundly ask yourself, “What is my own Mind?” with an intense yearning\nto resolve this question. This is called “training” or “practice[…]”\nExcerpt From\nThe Three Pillars of Zen\nRoshi P. Kapleau”\n“Zen 悟 (Realization) satori is about that ... Starting from directly authenticating clarity from using the first\nlevel koan. Like before birth who am I. The mind is put into a paradox ceasing all conceptualization\ndirectly authenticating clarity. This authentication is satori and non-conceptual because the mind itself is\nclear of what is inference and conceptual. So when it tastes it, it recognizes what they called the original\nface.” – John Tan, 2020\n\"The ultimate truth of who you are is not I am this or I am that, but I am.\" - Eckhart Tolle\n\"Being must be felt. It can't be thought.\" - Eckhart Tolle\n\"The mind and intellect do not remain apart from you.\nThe Bible says, “Be still and know that I am God”.\nStillness is the sole requisite for the realisation of the Self as God.\n(Talk 338)\nYour duty is to be: and not to be this or that.\n“I AM that I AM” sums up the whole truth.\n94\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe method is summed up in “BE STILL”.\nWhat does “stillness” mean?\nIt means “destroy yourself ”. Because any form or shape is the cause of trouble.\nGive up that notion that “I am so and so.”\n(Talk 363)\" - Sri Ramana Maharshi\n“Truth is an absolutely silent State of Being. So silent that you almost Disappear. So silent that You become\nsimply An Awareness.” - Osho\n“I AM THAT I AM\n3.13 Then Moses said to God: 'If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ''The God of your fathers\nhas sent me to you,'' and they ask, ''What is his name?'' what shall I say to them?\n3.14 God said to Moses, 'I am that I am'. And he said, 'Say this to the people of Israel, ''I am has sent me to\nyou''.\n3.15 '… this is My name forever and ever and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.'\nThis biblical quote comes from an Old Testament story that tells of an encounter between God and\nMoses. God, manifesting Himself as a voice, introduces Himself by saying, 'I am the God of your father,\nthe God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob' (Exodus 3:6). God appointed Moses to\nrepresent the Israelites, who were then living as slaves in Egypt, in the court of the Egyptian Pharaoh. He\nwanted Moses to plead their case with the Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and to lead them out of captivity.\nThe essence of mind is only awareness or consciousness. When the ego, however, dominates it, it\nfunctions as the reasoning, thinking or sensing faculty. The cosmic mind, being not limited by the ego, has\nnothing separate from itself and is therefore only aware. That is what the Bible means by 'I am that I am'.\n(Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 188)\n'I am' is the name of God. Of all the definitions of God, none is so well put as the biblical statement 'I am\nthat I am' in Exodus chapter three. There are other statements such as brahmavaiham [Brahman am I],\naham brahmasmi [I am Brahman] and soham [I am He]. But none is so direct as Jehovah [which means] 'I\nam'. (Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 106)\nIt [I am] is the substratum running through all the three states. Wakefulness passes off, I am; the dream\nstate passes off, I am; the sleep state passes off, I am. They repeat themselves and yet I am. (Talks with Sri\nRamana Maharshi, talk no. 244)\n95\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe egoless 'I am' is not a thought. It is realization. The meaning or significance of 'I' is God. (Talks with Sri\nRamana Maharshi, talk no. 226)\n'I exist' is the only permanent self-evident experience of everyone. Nothing else is so self-evident\n[pratyaksha] as 'I am'. What people call self-evident, viz., the experience they get through the senses, is far\nfrom self-evident. The Self alone is that. Pratyaksha is another name for Self. So to do self-analysis and be\n'I am' is the only thing to do. 'I am' is reality. 'I am this or that' is unreal. 'I am' is truth, another name for\nSelf. (Day by Day with Bhagavan, 22nd March, 1946)\nSince along with 'I', the aforementioned first name [mentioned in the previous verse], 'am' always shines\nas the light of reality, 'I am' is also the name. Among the many thousands of names of God, no name suits\nGod, who abides in the Heart, devoid of thought, so aptly as 'I' or 'I am'. Of all the known names of God, 'I',\n'I' alone will resound triumphantly when the ego is destroyed, rising as the silent supreme word [mauna\npara vak] in the Heart-space of those whose attention is Selfward-facing.

There are certain practices to slow\ndown thoughts and then eventually still the mind completely [that] is necessary.\nKoan is designed to trigger that authentication. Likewise for neti neti of self inquiry.\" – John Tan, 2020\n“Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into nothingness. When a practitioner becomes\nthoroughly clear about the illusory nature of individuality, subject-object division does not take place. A\nperson experiencing “AMness” will find “AMness in everything”. What is it like?\nBeing freed from individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all phenomenon merely pop in and out\nfrom the background of the AMness. The AMness is not experienced as an ‘entity’ residing anywhere,\nneither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take place.\nEven in the moment of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing\nthe ‘Real’ as clear as it can be. We cannot lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-\nemerges from it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going. This \"AMness\" is God.\nPractitioners should never mistake this as the true Buddha Mind! \"I AMness\" is the pristine awareness. That\nis why it is so overwhelming. Just that there is no 'insight' into its emptiness nature.” (Excerpt from Buddha\nNature is NOT \"I Am\") - John Tan, 2006\nIn the Chinese version of the above description of I AMness, John Tan wrote in 2007,\n“真如：当一个修行者深刻地体验到“我/我相”的虚幻时，虚幻的“我相”就有如溪河溶入大海，消失\n于无形。此时也即是大我的生起。此大我清澈灵明，有如一面虚空的镜子觉照万物。一切的来去，生\n死，起落，一切万事万物，缘生缘灭，皆从大我的本体内幻现。本体并不受影响，寂然不动，无来亦无\n去。此大我即是梵我/神我。\n注: 修行人不可错认这便是真正的佛心啊！由于执着于觉体与甚深的业力，修行人会难以入眠，严重时\n会得失眠症，而无法入眠多年。\"\nOnce a practitioner deeply experiences the illusoriness of “self/self-image”, the illusory “self-image”\ndissolves like a river merges into the great ocean, dissolving without a trace. This moment is also the arising\nof the Great Self. This Great Self is pure, mystically alive, clear and bright, just like an empty space-mirror\nreflecting the ten thousand things. The coming and going, birth and death, rise and fall, the ten thousand\nevents and ten thousand phenomena simply arise and cease according to conditions as illusory\nmanifestations appearing from within the ground-substratum of the Great Self. The ground-substratum\nnever gets affected, is still and without movement, without coming and without going. This Great Self is the\nAtman-Brahman, God-Self.\n97\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nCommentary: Practitioners should not mistaken this as the True Buddha Mind! Due to the karmic force of\ngrasping at a substance of awareness, a practitioner may have difficulty entering sleep, and in serious cases\nmay experience insomnia, the inability to fall asleep for many years.”\n“Venerable Master Xuyun expounded, “‘Let go of all worldly attachments and not a single thought will\narise.’ These two phrases are truly the prerequisites for Chan (Zen) meditation. If these two phrases are\nnot realized, not only will there be no success in Chan meditation, but even entering the practice is\nimpossible. This is because, entangled by myriad conditions and arising and ceasing thoughts, how can\nyou talk about practicing Chan?\n‘Let go of all worldly attachments and not a single thought will arise’ is the prerequisite for Chan\nmeditation. Since we know this, how can we achieve it? For those of the highest capability, one thought\neternally ceases, reaching the state of the Unborn, and they instantly realize Bodhi (enlightenment),\nwithout any entanglement or verbosity. Next, one eliminates phenomena through understanding the\nprinciple. Knowing that the self-nature is originally pure, afflictions and Bodhi, birth and death, and\nNirvana are all merely names and have no relation to the self-nature. All things and phenomena are like\ndreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows. This body of the four elements, along with mountains and rivers\nand the great earth, within the self-nature, are like bubbles in the sea, arising and ceasing as they please,\nwithout obstructing the fundamental ground-substratum.\nOne should not follow the arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing of illusory phenomena to generate\nfeelings of liking or disliking, attachment or aversion. Completely let go, like a dead person, naturally the\nsenses and consciousness will diminish, and greed, anger, ignorance, and attachment will be\nextinguished. The pains and pleasures, hunger and cold, fullness and warmth, honor and disgrace, life\nand death, misfortune and fortune, praise and blame, gain and loss, safety and danger, level and steep—\nall should be set aside. Only by doing so can one be considered to have let go. Once you let go, everything\nis let go, eternally let go, which is called ‘letting go of all worldly attachments.’\nWhen all worldly attachments are let go, delusional thoughts naturally disappear, discrimination does not\narise, and attachment is far removed. At this point, not a single thought arises, and the inherent\nbrightness of the self-nature fully reveals itself. At this stage, the conditions for Chan meditation are met.\nWith true effort in genuine investigation, only then can one realize the mind and see the true nature.”\n(Source: \"Convenient Teachings of Chan Practice Prerequisites\" by Venerable Master Xuyun)\n(The above is ChatGPT’s translation of the Chinese excerpt: 虚云老和尚开示道：“‘万缘放下，一念不生’这两句\n话，实在是参禅的先决条件。这两句话如果不做到，参禅不但是说没有成功，就是入门都不可能。盖（连词，表\n示原因）万缘缠绕，念念生灭，你还谈得上参禅吗？‘万缘放下，一念不生’，是参禅的先决条件，我们既然知道\n了，那末，如何才能做到呢？上焉者，一念永歇，直至无生，顿证菩提，毫无络索（啰嗦）。其次，则以理除事。\n了知自性，本来清净，烦恼菩提，生死涅槃，皆是假名，原不与我自性相干。事事物物，皆是梦幻泡影。我此四\n大色身，与山河大地，在自性中，如海中的浮沤一样，随起随灭，无碍本体。不应随一切幻事的生住异灭而起欣\n厌取舍。通身放下，如死人一样，自然根尘识心消落，贪嗔痴爱泯灭。所有这身子的痛痒苦乐、饥寒饱暖、荣辱\n生死、祸福吉凶、毁誉得丧、安危险夷，一概置之度外，这样才算放下。一放下，一切放下，永永放下，叫作万\n缘放下。万缘放下了，妄想自消，分别不起，执著远离，至此一念不生，自性光明，全体显露。至是参禅的条件\n具备了，再用功真参实究，明心见性才有分。”（《虚云和尚方便开示·参禅的先决条件》）)”\n98\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSession Start: Friday, March 21, 2008\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU - My stroke of insight | Jill Bolte Taylor\n(5:55 PM) AEN: bar. I thought \"that's very peculiar\" and I looked down at my body and I thought, \"whoa,\nI'm a weird-looking thing.\" And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal\nperception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space\nwhere I'm witnessing myself having this experience.\nAnd it was all every peculiar and my headache was just getting worse, so I get off the machine, and I'm\nwalking across my living room floor, and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.\nAnd every step is very rigid and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this\nconstriction in my area of perceptions so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my\nbathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialog inside of my body. I\nheard a little voice saying, \"OK, you muscles, you gotta contract, you muscles you relax.\"\n(5:55 PM) AEN:\nAnd I lost my balance and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I\ncan no longer define the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin and where I end. Because\nthe atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. And all I could\ndetect was this energy. Energy. And I'm asking myself, \"What is wrong with me, what is going on?\" And in\nthat moment, my brain chatter, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone\ntook a remote control and pushed the mute button and -- total silence.\nAnd at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by\nthe magnificence of energy around me. And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my\nbody, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there.\n(5:56 PM) AEN:\nWhen I awoke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit\nsurrender, I said goodbye to my life, and my mind is now suspended between two very opposite planes of\nreality. Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like\nwildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise\nand I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt enormous\nand expensive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my spirit soared free like a great whale\ngliding through the sea of silent euphoria. Harmonic. I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be\nable to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body.\nBut I realized \"But I'm still alive! I'm still alive and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana and\nI'm still alive, then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana.\" I picture a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,\ncompassionate, loving people who knew that they could com\n(5:57 PM) AEN:\nSo who are we?

The vividness of 'forms' is known as it without background. the insight becomes completely clear in\nstage 5. It is an 'already is' natural state of pristine awareness. Always so.”\n“AEN posted a great site [a video by Francis Lucille] about what I am trying to convey. Do go through the\nvideos. I will divide what that are being discussed in the videos into the method, the view and the\nexperience for ease of illustration as follows:\n1. The method is what that is commonly known as self enquiry.\n2. The view currently we have is dualistic. We see things in terms of subject/object division.\n3. The experience can be further divided into the followings:\n3.1 A strong individual sense of identity\n3.2 An oceanic experience free from conceptualization.\nThis is due to the practitioner freeing himself from conceptuality, from labels and symbols. The mind\ncontinuous disassociates itself from all labeling and symbols.\n3.3 An oceanic experience dissolving into everything.\nThe period of non-conceptuality is prolonged. Long enough to dissolve the mind/body ‘symbolic’ bond\nand therefore inner and outer division is temporarily suspended.\n101\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe experience for 3.2 and 3.3 are transcendental and are precious. However these experiences are\ncommonly misinterpreted and distorted by objectifying these experiences into an entity that is “ultimate,\nchangeless and independent”. The objectified experience is known as Atman, God or Buddha Nature by\nthe speaker in the videos. It is known as the experience of “I AM” with differing degree of intensity of non-\nconceptuality. Usually practitioners that have experienced 3.2 and 3.3 find it difficult to accept the\ndoctrine of Anatta and Emptiness. The experiences are too clear, real and blissful to discard. They are\noverwhelmed.\nBefore we go further, why do you think these experiences are distorted?\n(hint: The view currently we have is dualistic. We see things in terms of subject/object division.)” – John\nTan, 2008\n“And as indicated in the conversation I posted yesterday, after I AM everything else does seem unreal like\na dream, a movie projection on the cinema screen of Self or Pure Consciousness which is the sole doubtless\nreality, the more Real than Real. You feel like an infinite ground of being out of which the apparently moving\nsceneries and characters float by/emerge from within an unmoving, formless and attributeless ground of\nPure Being and Pure Consciousness or the Source. When you jog, you don't feel like a person going pass\nthe trees and people and scenery around you, you feel like being an unmoving Beingness (like a cinema\nscreen) in which passing images of people, trees and sceneries and even your bodily movements float\nby/emerge from/within/then subside back into that unmoving ground of Being/Presence. Thats how I\nexperience or describe the world at my I AM phase, when exercising and moving about in the world.\nActually this is a good video -- it talks about the world as being like a dream (even using the analogy of the\nmatrix and virtual reality), then the certainty of Being as a realization to the point of complete certainty,\nthen non-dual (one mind). It is not Buddhism but about Advaitic realization.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa4WtuR0wbY” – Soh, 2020\n“I was doing self inquiry yesterday with my back straight and legs crossed in the position of sitting\nmeditation, contemplating 'Who am I', 'Before Birth Who am I'... with an intense desire to know the truth of\nmy being. As the thoughts subside, an intense and palpable sense of beingness and presence, the only\n'thing' that remains that I feel to be my innermost essence... became very obvious... very very vivid and\nintense, and feels like a constant background in which everything is taking place, thoughts (almost none at\nthat moment, but arise afterwards) that arise are also taking place in this unchanging background... and\nthere is this certainty and doubtlessness about this I AM-ness, IT is absolutely real and undeniable. IT/I\nAMness/The Witness is the only solid and undoubtable Presence and is clearly present with or without\nthoughts.” - Soh’s E-Book & Journal, February 2010 entry\n“That which is sure of its existence – the innermost certainty of I Am – is what you essentially are. In other\nwords: I Am this knowing that knows that I Am.” - Leo Hartong\n102\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n\"The notion that there is an Observer on one hand, and an object of observation on the other hand, is\npurely the product of conceptual thinking/dualizing.\nIn actual experience, once you touch that 'certainty of being' that I mentioned, there is no observer and\nobserved distinction. There is just a non-dual sense of Existence, Being, Presence, Knowing, without a sense\nof 'me' being separated from 'that'. You Are That Knowing which is certain that You Are! The distinction\nbetween knower, knowing, and known dissolve into That. You Are That!\" – Soh, May 2010 during I AM phase\nThe 9th century Chinese Ch’an/Zen master, Lin Chi (Japanese: Rinzai): “An ancient doctor says that the body\nis dependent on its meaning, and the ground is describable by its substance. Being so, we know that\nDharma-body and Dharma-ground are reflections of the (original) light. O Venerable Sirs, let us take hold\nof this person who handles these reflections. For he is the source of all the Buddhas and the house of truth-\nseekers everywhere. The body made up of the four elements does not understand how to discourse or\nhow to listen to a discourse. Nor do the liver, the stomach, the kidneys, the bowels. Nor does the vacuity of\nspace. That which is most unmistakably perceivable right before your eyes, though without form, yet\nabsolutely identifiable—this is what understands the discourse and listens to it.” - Embodied Nonduality\nhttps://realizationprocess.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/EmbodiedNonduality.essay_.pdf\n“Who are we? Really\n“The Matrix” is one movie that got many a viewer pondering on the nature of reality. I, for one, am a great\nfan of The Matrix. In many ways, although not exactly true or that diabolical, the movie is symbolic of the\nnature of reality. Many a times, meditation allows one to catch glimpses beyond the\nordinary. There are some meditation sessions that literally redefined my identity\nand altered my perception of the world. I must emphasize that meditation is the major modality that helped\nme to understand myself better.\nThe Eternal Watcher- The True Identity\nIn one ‘awakening’ meditation, I came to a state of no thoughts. Such experiences are very hard to describe.\nThis is because the explanation process itself, is within the medium of thoughts and concepts. It is\nimpossible to describe a state of no thoughts using thoughts! Anyway, in the void of no thoughts, one\nnaturally assume that everything must be an unconscious blank. However, that was not the case! What\ncame next was quite a revelation to me. In the void of no thought, I perceived myself to be a Presence...\nHere's how I will describe myself.\n\"The Presence is all pervasive, yet un-intrusive. He seems to be in all\nthings and observes with utter passiveness. He exists beyond concepts,\nbeliefs and do not need any form. Therefore, I understand him as\n103\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\neternal.\nHe also seems to be the subtler state of myself. I also got the feeling\nthat he existed in all my lifetimes or even more. If I were to name him, I\nwill describe him as The Eternal Watcher.”\nYou can say that I was completely blown away by the experience. The ‘discovery’ of the Eternal Watcher was\na very important event that completely changed the way I understood consciousness. It also made me\ncontemplated very deeply and seriously about the possible existence of the Divine. These spurred me on\nan ardent search to understand and make sense of it all. I corresponded with whoever I think can help me\nunlock the mystery. These people included clairvoyants, other meditators, people on spiritual paths and\nnew-agers.\nFrom these investigations, it was discovered that others have had similar experiences as well. Based on the\nconsistency and plurality of the descriptions by others, something becomes very certain to me. That is, a\nhuman being is much more than a body that can talk and think. The Human Personality, which is our\ncharacter, is only an outer consciousness of the human. With regard to our identity, our personality is\nmerely the tip of the iceberg. Within the human being’s psyche lie much subtler and often-obscured levels\nof consciousness. I believe these inner consciousnesses could be the different depths of the Soul or levels\nof being-ness even more profound than that. About the Eternal Watcher, he is ever present. You didn’t see\nhim doesn’t means he is not there. Because the Presence is so close to the mind, it is not easily perceived.\nPerceiving the Eternal Watcher was achieved through the relaxed observation of my own breath. The ultra-\nrelaxed observation eventually becomes a purely passive allowance for thoughts to pass through my\nconsciousness. This, in turn, led to a gradual shutting down of the mental processes of my physical brain\ncumulating into a state of ‘no-thoughts’. Beyond the transitional phase of ‘no-thoughts’, I became the\nEternal Watcher. Experiencing the Eternal Watcher is not an exercise that I can easily brush off as\ninconsequential. It is not possible for me to assume that my perception of existence and life can be the\nsame as before. Doing so will be blatantly self-deceiving. To me, the most profound experiences where not\nfrom doing something. They came from doing nothing.\nI believed the Eternal Watcher is the individualized God/Source Presence within oneself. I also believe this\nPresence is Rigpa as described in Tibetan Buddhism. Some people suggest that the Presence is the same\nas the Oversoul. However, I am not too sure about this. I hope I am not confusing you. In any case, the only\nway to validate all these is to personally experience the Presence (Eternal Watcher) and these states for\noneself.\nThat ‘no-thought experience’ was not the only mystical meditative experience. I have also experienced\nbeing a vast ocean of bliss. Ironically, the meditations that were attempted with an agenda of wanting to\nexperience something mystical are the ones that are the least successful. Expectation puts a limit on how\nfar one’s consciousness can go. For me, it was better to keep an open mind before sitting down to Meditate.”\n104\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n- by Sim Pern Chong, written in 2004 or prior. Sim Pern Chong is a Singaporean like Soh and John Tan, and\nwas the first to realize anatta and emptiness after encountering John Tan more than a decade ago. At that\ntime he already realised I AM for many years. See A Compilation of Simpo's Writings\n“Hi,\nBesides the Jhanas, have you experience pure empty Presence in a state of no thought? That is the true\nstate of a Being. It is beyond the mind, beyond concepts.\nThis pure Presence is all pervading, yet void at the same time. In my experience, the Jhanas are different.\nJhana's are like 'looking outward' in a meditation, pure Presence is 'looking inwards'. I can't describe it very\nwell.\nPure presence can best be felt when a person is at the moment free from desires. Pure presence is like the\nray that emits its properties into the mind. The properties of the pure presence form your personality.\nHi Sangha,\nI am in no position to say whether Pure presence is nibbana. I can only write from my own experience and\nunderstanding.\nThis pure presence is called Rigpa in Tibetan Buddhism. I am not a Buddhist in this life, but I was a Tibetan\nMonk of Nyingma school several lifetimes ago. That is why I still have a lot of interest in Buddhism.\nAbout Rigpa, when we experience it. It is formless and empty and at the same time infinite and all pervading.\nIt is NOT BLISS. Bliss is a samadhi state but it is not the true nature yet, it is still a state in the mind. I have\nbliss experiences also, in fact i have then now quite often outside of meditation also.\nRigpa is a presence of 'yourself' that is connect to everything in the universe. That is probably why the\nBuddha say that there is 'no self'. All is connect to all in the Dharmakaya. Rigpa is a part of the Dharmakaya.\nWhen in the state, there is no separation into you or me... We are all one thing which cannot be described.\nHowever, I must say that even now, while reading this, we are already the rigpa. We do not realise this is\nbecause we THINK we are just the mind/personality. The mind/personality is a REFLECTION from rigpa. It\nis not the true self. If you understand what I am write, you may get a sudden awakening/realisation. And if\nthe realisation is deep enough, your viewpoint or way of seeing the world will change.\nJust my 2 cents...”\n105\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n- Sim Pern Chong, 2004, https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2013/09/early-forum-posts-by-\nthusness_17.html\n“Just my opinion...\nFor my case, the first time i experienced a definitive I AM presence, there was zero thought. just a borderless,\nall pervading presence. In fact, there was no thinking or looking out for whether this is I AM or not. There\nwas no conceptual activity. It was interpreted as 'I AM' only after that experience.\nTo me, I AM experience is actually a glimpse of the way reality is.. but it is quickly re-interpreted. The\nattribute of 'borderlessness' is experienced. but other 'attributes such as 'no subject-object', 'transparent\nluminosity, emptiness are not understood yet.\nMy take, is that when 'I AM' is experienced, you will be doubtless that it is the experience.”\n- Sim Pern Chong, 2022\n“John Tan: [00:33:09] We call it the presence or we call it, um, we call it the presence. (Speaker: is it the I\nAM?) I AM is actually different. It's also presence. It's also presence. I AM, depending on... You see the\ndefinition of I AM also not. So, uh. Not really the same for some people, like Jonavi? He actually wrote to\nme saying that his I AM is like localized one in the head. So it's very individual. But that is not the I AM that\nwe are talking about. The I AM is actually a very uh, like for example, I think, uh. Long Chen (Sim Pern\nChong) actually went through. It's actually all encompassing. It's actually what we call a non-dual\nexperience. It's actually a very, um. There's no thoughts. It's just a pure sense of existence. And it can be a\nvery powerful. It is indeed a very powerful experience. So when, let's say when you are. When you're very\nyoung. Especially when you are ...my age. When you first experience I AM, it is very different. It's a very\ndifferent experience. We never experienced that before. So, um, I don't know whether it can be even\nconsidered as an experience. Um, because there is no thoughts. It's just Presence. But this presence is\nvery quickly. It's very quickly. yeah. It's really quickly. Um. Misinterpreted due to our karmic tendency to of\nunderstanding something in a dualistic and in a in a very concrete manner. So very when we experience\nthe we have the experience, the interpretation is very different. And that the, the, the wrong way of\ninterpretation actually create a very dualistic experience.” - John Tan, March 2021 AtR Meeting\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYAVGmj8JD8IAU8rQ7krwFvtGN1PNmaoDNLOCRcCTAw\n“Someone asked me about luminosity. I said it is not simply a state of heightened clarity or mindfulness,\nbut like touching the very heart of your being, your reality, your very essence without a shadow of doubt.\nIt is a radiant, shining core of Presence-Awareness, or Existence itself. It is the More Real than Real. It can\nbe from a question of \"Who am I?\" followed by a sudden realization. And then with further insights you\ntouch the very life, the very heart, of everything. Everything comes alive. First as the innermost 'You', then\nlater when the centerpoint is dropped (seen through -- there is no 'The Center') every 'point' is equally so,\nevery point is A 'center', in every encounter, form, sound and activity.” - Soh, 2018\n106\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“...It is that direct pointing right to the centre of the heart beyond all verbalization, that you have\nundoubtedly seen, tasted and realized “Awareness”. It is the flair that mystics penetrate beyond forms,\nsituations, conditions, all arbitrary opinions and communicates directly about this realization….\n...So what is the realization about?\nThe realization that “Awareness” is of a different dimension. It is a touch of “Spirit”, a taste of “Divinity”, not\nof the dimension of earth, water, space, fire and wind (However as I have pointed out, it should not be\ntreated as beyond and needless [to treat it as a beyond] once seen through [i.e. anatta realization]).\nThe knowledge of this is gnosis. It is not a mere experience or simply the radiance of “knowingness” nor is\nthis expounded in Madhyamaka.\nIt is not just an experience, it is not just merely non-dual, it is a taste of what that is more ‘real’ than ‘real’.\nHow can this die and be subject to change for this is the very source of life itself?\nThis is the “heart” of Zen in the wholehearted smile of Maha Kashyapa. This is the direct realization of\n“Buddha” beyond experience and verbalization.\n(Soh: the famous Ch'an/Zen slogan\n\"Direct pointing to the human heart; Seeing the nature and becoming Buddha; Not standing on letters; A separate\ntransmission outside the scriptures.\")\nMr. J’s message is centered on this and an awakening is the awakening to this dimension, the deepest core\nof one’s beingness and existence. Purged of this, nothing is worth to be termed “enlightenment”. This is the\nwhole message that Mr. J is carrying (imo).\nHow is this related to “Rigpa”? I have no idea as I am not a practitioner in Dzogchen but definitely it is the\n“heart” of Zen. This is what triggers the journey and ends the journey.\nOn the other hand, your emphasis is on anatta. An equally important insight and is the key of Buddhist’s\nenlightenment. Divorcing this insight in expense of any other realizations can hardly be termed “Buddhist’s\nawakening” and prajna wisdom is the full maturing of this insight.\nI wrote this because for readers that have not awaken to what Mr. J is pointing appear confusing. As for\nyou, you will have to be more skillful in integrating them.\n107\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIn any case neither of these insights should be overlooked. The realization that Mr. J emphasized is precious\nbut to grasp the breadth and depth of this priceless jewel requires far more than that in one's spiritual\njourney. It requires the awakening of prajna wisdom to pierce into the deepest depth of duality and\ninherency. There is nothing that needs to be done yet there is so much “doing” during the “undoing” process\ndue simply to a mistaken view. This simple mistaken view is so powerfully hypnotic that it requires the birth\nof a Buddha to expound the truth of it, so not to underestimate it.\nHomage to Buddha\n.............\nUpdate by AEN:\nI asked Thusness: The taste of spirit is not limited only to the formless mind/thought realm but can be\nfound in all senses too isn't it?\nThusness: Yes. Go through it... and contemplate to balance and refine your insights.\nMe: Then why do you say it is different from the radiance of the earth etc? I'd see it as the equal taste as I\ntold Piotr. I think Actual Freedom Richard had similar experience yet can't recognise the equal taste in I AM\n[mind/thought realm], whereas I AM practitioners may not recognise the equal taste in senses.\nThusness: I did not say [that the taste can't be seen in all manifestation] but I said that is Mr. J's heart of\nrealization. Updated to clarify.\nMe: I see. What do you mean by needless once seen through. Needless to seek beyond?\nThusness: Yes only when view is dualistic and inherent it appears so. But that quality and dimension of\nrealization must remain.\n.........\n11/4/13 4:43:58 PM: Soh Wei Yu: Piotr asked how is this not reification: “How can this die and subject to\nchange for this is the very source of life itself.”\n11/4/13 5:01:45 PM: John Tan: That is reification and self view. Eternalist view. It is easy to get overwhelmed\nand amplified by the realization. Therefore view is important. A person with inherent and dualistic view will\nfind it difficult to overcome that realization unless one arises another insight that is more overwhelming\nwithout the taste and flavor of the \"absolute\". Then gradually refine the view through experience and faith\nin Dharma.\n108\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n11/4/13 5:48:38 PM: John Tan: It is not easy to overcome as I told Piotr for Mr. J's case. Imagine if you were\nto talk to someone like Ramana Maharishi.\n11/4/13 5:55:18 PM: John Tan: The overcoming has been tough for me too. It is not a smooth path... At least\nnot as smooth as you… lol\n.........\nThusness wrote to Mr. J:\nHi Mr. J, Despite all differences we may have about lower yanas, no practices needed, Absolute… I really\nappreciate your zealous attempt to bring this message into view and I agree with you wholeheartedly on\nthis aspect of “transmission”. If one truly wants this essence to be “transmitted”, how can it be otherwise?\nFor what is to be passed is truly of a different dimension, how can it be adulterated with words and forms?\nThe ancient teachers are extremely serious in observing and waiting for the right condition to pass the\nessence unreservedly and wholeheartedly. So much so that when the essence is transmitted, it must boil\nthe blood and penetrate deep into the bone marrow. The entire body-mind must become one opening eye.\nOnce open, everything turns “spirit”, mind intellect drops and what’s left is aliveness and intelligence\neverywhere! Mr. J, I sincerely hope you well, just don’t leave trace in the Absolute. Gone! :)” - Writings from\nJohn Tan in 2013\n“Sire Mejia I Am realization is exquisitely clear realization that “I think therefore I Am” is an error. It’s not an\nerror in the sense that it is a thought/belief and completely fine to be there, it is in error in the sense that I\nAm is clearly seen to be primary to and independent of any thought/belief no matter how gross or subtle.\nMeaning the sense of existence is so self-obvious that it is thoroughly and definitely seen to not be\ncontingent in the least upon any thought/belief/position/view. It is no small thing or sudden conceptual\nunderstanding that is known to be “the right one.” It is so real that all previous paradigms of real are utterly\nobliterated. It is so astounding when realized that many take it to be the end of realization (it’s actually the\nbeginning). Teachings around pure being, “everything is consciousness” etc are rooted in this realization.\nSorry to interject there ” - Angelo Gerangelo\n“William Lam: It's non conceptual.\nJohn Tan: It’s non conceptual. Yup. Okay. Presence is not conceptual experience, it has to be direct. And\nyou just feel pure sense of existence. Means people ask you, before birth, who are you? You just\nauthenticate the I, that is yourself, directly. So when you first authenticate that I, you are damn happy, of\ncourse. When young, that time, wah… I authenticate this I… so you thought that you’re enlightened, but\nthen the journey continues. So this is the first time you taste something that is different. It is… It is before\nthoughts, there is no thoughts. Your mind is completely still. You feel still, you feel presence, and you\nknow yourself. Before birth it is Me, after birth, it is also Me, 10,000 years it’s still this Me, 10,000 year\n109\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nbefore, it’s still this Me. So you authenticate that, your mind is just that and authenticate your own true\nbeing, so you don't doubt that. In later phase…\nKenneth Bok: Presence is this I AM?\nJohn Tan: Presence is the same as I AM. Presence is the same as… of course, other people may disagree,\nbut actually they're referring to the same thing. The same authentication, the same what... even in Zen is\nstill the same.\nBut in later phase, I conceive that as just the thought realm. Means, in the six, I always call the six entries\nand six exits, so there is the sound and there’s all these… During that time, you always say I’m not sound,\nI’m not the appearance, I AM the Self that is behind all these appearances, alright? So, sounds, sensations,\nall these come and go, your thoughts come and go, those are not me, correct? This is the ultimate Me.\nThe Self is the ultimate Me. Correct?\nWilliam Lam: So, is that nondual? The I AM stage. It’s non-conceptual, was it nondual?\nJohn Tan: It’s nonconceptual. Yes, it is nondual. Why is it nondual? At that moment, there is no duality at all,\nat that moment when you experience the Self, you cannot have duality, because you are authenticated\ndirectly as IT, as this pure sense of Being. So, it’s completely I, there’s nothing else, just I. There’s nothing\nelse, just the Self. I think, many of you have experienced this, the I AM. So, you probably will go and visit all\nthe Hinduism, sing song with them, meditate with them, sleep with them, correct? Those are the young\ndays. I meditate with them, hours after hours, meditate, sit with them, eat with them, sing song with them,\ndrum with them.

This is not merely a glimpse or experience\nthat later fades or leaves doubts or uncertainty, in which case you can be said to have had an “I AM\nexperience” but not “I AM realization (Self-Realization)”.\nExperiences associated with I AM include:\n- Spacious mirror-like Presence behind all objects\n- Being an unchanging and formless Witnessing Presence\n- Of not being the body, but a Spirit\n- Energetic experiences/releases (“At that moment of realization, I experienced a tremendous flow of\nenergy being released.

You will first only know about the\nluminosity, the clear, sharp, vivid experience. Then when you progress further, it is the empty space, void\nyet with a crystal clear sensation that becomes the object of your grasp. you will become intrigued by the\n'transparency', like a crystal clear void. :) This is experiencing the 'pure', 'pristine' quality of awareness.” -\nJohn Tan, 2009\nThere are also many other meditative states and moods, generally categorized into bliss, non-thought and\nclarity. You can experience episodes of bliss, episodes of being free from thoughts, episodes of intensified\nclarity or expansion of consciousness. However all these experiences are like mist, they disappear after a\nwhile. They are not the kind of pivotal breakthrough realization or Eureka that Self-Realization brings, a\nrealization that comes with unshakeable certainty that will never be lost.\nWrote to someone:\n“What you call \"One Taste of Emptiness, and this \"feels\" like an all-containing, all-pervading Space.\" --\nactually this is an aspect of what I call I AM, however, it was experienced even before my realization of I\nAM. In other words, there was a period between 2007 and 2009 where I was having glimpses of I AM here\nand there, and towards 2009 I had very strong glimpses and experiences of the space-like nature of I AM.\nHowever there was still no doubtless realisation yet.\nAlso I discussed my experience of one's true nature as awareness that is space-like and all-pervading\nduring 2009 with my Mahayana teacher who confirmed it with me and told me I was going in the right\ndirection.\nI also wrote in sgForums then, dated 4 January 2009: \"Our true nature is like clear space, a presence\n111\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\npervading everything but not limited or confined by anything. It is sky like awareness.\nHowever we are often fixated on the particular thoughts, feelings, and because of this we lose sight of\nspacious awareness.\nJust like most of us look at particular shapes and forms but never notices the space surrounding them.\nWhen one aligns with spacious awareness, there is no fixation on anything, like the sky doesn't bother or\nget bothered by the clouds passing by. They just pass by without hindrance. But at the same time they\nare felt intimately in that field of spacious presence.\"\nIn reply, John Tan wrote to me about the nondual and anatta (which I only come to realize almost two\nyears later):\n\"Hi AEN,\nYes not to be fixated but also not to objectify the “spaciousness” otherwise “spaciousness” is no less\nfixated. The ‘space’ appears appealing only to a mind that abstracts but to a fully participating and\ninvolving mind, such “spaciousness” has immediately sets itself apart, distancing itself from inseparable.\nEmptiness is never a behind background but a fully partaking foreground manifesting as the arising and\npassing phenomena absence of a center. Therefore understand ‘spaciousness’ not like sky but like\npassing clouds and flowing water, manifesting whenever condition is. If ‘Emptiness’ has made us more\nfixated and immobilized this innate freedom of our non-dual luminosity, then it is ‘stubborn emptiness’.\nNevertheless, no matter what said, it is always inadequate. If we want to fully realize the inexpressible, be\nwilling to give up all centers and point of references that manifests in the form of ‘who’, ‘when’ and\n‘where’. Just give up the entire sense of self then instantly all things are spontaneously perfected.\nJust a sharing, nothing intense.\nHappy New Year! :)\"\nIn the following months, he also clarified to me the difference between my experience of my true nature\nas space-like awareness as the I AM realization:\nalso\n\"1. On Experience and Realization\nComments by Soh: Also see related article - I AM Experience/Glimpse/Recognition vs I AM Realization\n112\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(Certainty of Being)\nOne of the direct and immediate response I get after reading the articles by Rob Burbea and Rupert is\nthat they missed one very and most important point when talking about the Eternal Witness Experience --\nThe Realization. They focus too much on the experience but overlook the realization. Honestly I do not\nlike to make this distinction as I see realization also as a form of experience. However in this particular\ncase, it seems appropriate as it could better illustrate what I am trying to convey. It also relates to the few\noccasions where you described to me your space-like experiences of Awareness and asked whether they\ncorrespond to the phase one insight of Eternal Witness. While your experiences are there, I told you ‘not\nexactly’ even though you told me you clearly experienced a pure sense of presence.\nSo what is lacking? You do not lack the experience, you lack the realization. You may have the blissful\nsensation or feeling of vast and open spaciousness; you may experience a non-conceptual and objectless\nstate; you may experience the mirror like clarity but all these experiences are not Realization. There is no\n‘eureka’, no ‘aha’, no moment of immediate and intuitive illumination that you understood something\nundeniable and unshakable -- a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from\nthis realization because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of it. It is the direct and unshakable\ninsight of ‘You’. This is the realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen satori. You\nwill understand clearly why it is so difficult for those practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the\ndoctrine of anatta. Actually there is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to\ninclude the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous nature. Like what Rob\nsaid, \"keep the experience but refine the views\".\nLastly this realization is not an end by itself, it is the beginning. If we are truthful and not over exaggerate\nand get carried away by this initial glimpse, we will realize that we do not gain liberation from this\nrealization; contrary we suffer more after this realization. However it is a powerful condition that\nmotivates a practitioner to embark on a spiritual journey in search of true freedom. :)\" -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html\nHalf a year after this post, I realized I AM.”\n(Soh: the reason John Tan said ‘we suffer more after this [I AM] realization’ is due to his energy imbalances\ntriggered after I AM. However, the period after I AM realization was blissful and mostly problem-free for\nme, as I avoided pitfalls or incorrect practice by practicing according to John’s pointers and guidance, which\nI have written in this chapter. See chapter on Tips on Energy Imbalances for more details.).\nFor the I AM phase, it is essential to reach the point of Realization. Having mere experiences and glimpses\nis insufficient.\n113\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSomeone asked, “In this video (and his writings) Wheeler is saying that the simple ordinary feeling of\nbeing/awareness is what he and the other teachers/traditions/books are talking about. But the description\nof AtR I AM sounds like an extraordinary realization of certainty of being with some extraordinary\nexperiences. How to reconcile this?\nhttps://youtu.be/WdGmvOGwWTs”\nI replied, “Good video. It is not different from what John Wheeler talks about or anything that standard\nAdvaita materials talk about.\nI said I AM realization comes with doubtless certainty, and is different from an experience or glimpse. You\ncan see that after John Wheeler realized his Self after meeting Sailor Bob Adamson, he speaks with\nconfidence and doubtless certainty grounded in his direct knowledge of Self, and he no longer felt that this\n'Awareness' is some state to be maintained or an experience to be grasped or that comes and fades, etc.\nAll these indicate that one has not reached the point of complete doubtless certainty. If and when he talks\nabout 'ordinary awareness', he is talking with doubtless certainty what his ever-present essence of Being\nor Awareness is, whereas normal people have only a vague idea of what awareness is and lack that sort of\ndoubtless certainty.\nJohn Wheeler said \"Am I feeling doubt or metaphysical uncertainty? Is the knowledge of my true nature\nunshakable? If not, the understanding is not complete.\" - https://awakeningclaritynow.com/awakening-to-\nthe-natural.../\n\"Keep it simple. You are present and aware. This is beyond doubt. Feel your way into this doubtless\npresence that you are. All other considerations take you into conceptual thought and away from what is\nbeing pointed to.\", \"You know that you are. This is beyond doubt. Stop there and be. Start to think of what\nthat means and you step back into thought and doubt.\" - You Were Never Born, John Wheeler\nI also said you feel [that Presence is] God-Like (Especially when the ‘impersonality’ aspect comes forth, see the\nFour Aspects of I AM), or more precisely is God itself:\n\"Saints and sages throughout history have found their true nature to be that one light. You, too, are that\nlight. You are not separate or different from those beings, because the divine is one and shines alike in\neveryone as their own true self.\", \"The aim is the dissolution of the separate seeker. This is realized by\ninquiring if the separate seeker is even present, or else through acknowledgement of the supremacy of the\none power. Either way, the separate self is removed from the equation. God or reality alone remains, the\none omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient source. That is nothing but pure love itself.\" - You Were Never\nBorn, John Wheeler\nJohn Wheeler also said, “Once you get a basic sense of this, you discover some very incredible things about\nthis basic aware presence. There is nothing mundane about it at all.” -\n114\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhttps://johnwheelernonduality.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/clarifying-ones-essential-identity-an-interview-\nwith-john-wheeler/\nOnce you have true Self-Realization, your knowledge of Self is doubtless and unshakeable.\nSo unshakeable that not even the Buddha will be able to shake your understanding.\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../realization...\n\"moment of immediate and intuitive illumination that you understood something undeniable and\nunshakable -- a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from this realization\nbecause the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of it. It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’. This\nis the realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen satori. \" - John Tan, 2009\nAnother example of doubtless, unshakeable certainty:\nWhen Fa-chang (752-839 CE) of Mt. Ta-mei (\"Great Plum\") first visited the master, he inquired about the\nmeaning of the word \"Buddha.\"\n\"The Mind is Buddha,\" said Ma-tsu. Upon that Fa-chang was enlightened. Later Fa-chang retired once more\nto Ta-mei and taught others there. When the master heard of this, he dispatched a monk to inquire what it\nwas that Fa-chang had so learned that allowed him to presume to head a mountain lineage. Fa-chang told\nthe monk that it was the dictum, \"The Mind is Buddha.\" The monk noted, \"Recently the master sings a\ndifferent tune. Now it is 'Neither Mind nor Buddha'.\"\nFa-chang reacted, \"That rascal deludes people to no end! Let him teach you how there is neither mind nor\nBuddha. For my part, I will stick to 'The Mind is Buddha.'\"\nWhen the monk reported this to the master, Ma-tsu remarked, \"Indeed, the plum is ripe.\"”\nThis certainty does not indicate that one has reached the final realization or insight, but it is an important\nbreakthrough nonetheless.\nDzogchen teacher Sogyal Rinpoche taught, “Sometimes when I meditate, I don't use any particular method.\nI just allow my mind to rest, and find, especially when I am inspired, that I can bring my mind home and\nrelax very quickly. I sit quietly and rest in the nature of mind; I don't question or doubt whether I am in the\n\"cor-rect\" state or not. There is no effort, only rich understanding, wakefulness, and unshakable certainty.\nWhen I am in the nature of mind, the ordinary mind is no longer there. There is no need to sustain or\nconfirm a sense of being: I simply am. A fundamental trust is present. There is nothing in par-ticular to\ndo… …If meditation is simply to continue the flow of Rigpa after the introduction, how do we know when it\nis Rigpa and when it is not? I asked Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche this ques-tion, and he replied with his\ncharacteristic simplicity: \"If you are in an unaltered state, it is Rigpa.\" If we are not contriving or manipulating\nthe mind in any way, but simply resting in an unaltered state of pure and pristine awareness, then that is\n115\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nRigpa. If there is any contriving on our part or any kind of manipulating or grasping, it is not. Rigpa is a state\nin which there is no longer any doubt; there is not really a mind to doubt: You see directly. If you are in this\nstate, a complete, natural certainty and confidence surge up with the Rigpa itself, and that is how you know.”\n(Note: this is the initial Rigpa of Dzogchen, but not the final, ripened Rigpa. For more information, read The\nDegrees of Rigpa)\nAs Adyashanti said, \"Emptiness [Soh: not Thusness Stage 6 but I AMness in this context] is not the totality\nof what you are. Emptiness is a profound aspect of what you are, it's a profound taste of your true nature,\nit's not the totality of what you are any than getting up in the morning and feeling good is the totality of\nwhat you are, or feeling bad is a totality of what you are... ...Whenever you touch upon a deep truth,\nsuchness of reality, your true nature, each aspect feels like it's total and complete and all-inclusive at that\nmoment. So that's why teachers have a very hard time getting through to people when they have an\ninitial experience of anything because if it's an initial experience of reality it feels totally complete and\nthere is a certain innate confidence that arises within you. Not an egoic confidence but a confidence that\ncomes from reality.\"\n“The Doorway of “I Am”\nHow strange it is to look deeply into one’s true nature. We can all state with certainty, “I am.” That’s the\nstarting point—not “I am this or that,” but simply “I am.” We have all been taught to add onto this sense of\n“I am” various defining characteristics and evaluations. But these are secondary at best, a collection of\nconditioned conclusions and evaluations, most of which were inherited from the people and the world\naround us; put simply, they are nonessential. The “I am” is essential to being self-conscious; it is the\nquintessential articulation and confession of self-consciousness itself. Everything that gets added unto\nthis primary sense of “I am” obscures one’s essential nature.\nAnother way to approach the “I am” sense is to simply attend to your immediate sense of being. This is\nnot as simple as it sounds because we are so accustomed to thinking about our experience rather than\nsimply experiencing our experience. This is exactly where good spiritual practice comes in. The essence of\nany good spiritual practice is to focus on direct experience rather than on what we think about the\nexperience. To focus on the immediate sense of “I am” devoid of all interpretations and evaluations is\nitself a powerful spiritual practice. The immediate sense of “I am” is like being a simple conscious\npresence, prior to being a someone or something with a history in time. In fact, with a little practice and\nwillingness to let go of clinging to one’s familiar identity, this simple and immediate sense of “I am” will\nreveal itself to be the same underlying conscious presence as all other conscious beings.\nThis then forms the basis of a transformed relationship with all beings, where our essential sameness\nbecomes the ground of our relatedness with others, even as we have a newfound respect and\nappreciation for our human differences. The universal “I am” wears an infinite variety of masks that we\nhuman beings call our personality. But connecting with the universal “I am” in oneself and in other beings\nallows us to connect from a universal and essential basis, rather than from being exclusively entranced by\nsurface appearances and conditioned reactions.\n116\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe “I am” is a doorway into the essential, the universal, and the sacred. To gain entry into that doorway\nrequires us to step into the realm of not knowing—which is simply to say that we must unknow, or\ntemporarily suspend, everything that we think that we know about ourselves. We must enter into a state\nof innocent unknowing just prior to all egocentric identification. We must not only think about doing this,\nor imagine doing it—we must actually do it! We must let go and not know who or what we are. Then, and\nonly then, can we directly sense into the “I am,” the conscious presence which pervades any and all\nperceptions and experiences. Then we dwell as that conscious presence. The rest of the unfolding will\nhappen by itself, in its own time. Patient persistence is the key.\nEventually, even the “I am” sense will fall away . . . and self-consciousness will dissolve into its source. But\nfor now, let’s not define this source, for there is no substance to the source to grasp hold of. Everywhere\nthe supreme reality is on display, but nowhere can it be grasped. Follow the “I am” to its source, to that\ndark light that sees but cannot be seen, and knows but cannot be known. When the eye that never sleeps\nawakens—yes, this is a contradiction to the intellect—the dharma wheel of enlightenment turns\neverywhere. This, at least, is how it feels and has always felt.\nCopyright © 2021 Adyashanti.”\n“PERCEPTIONS ARE NEVER THE TRUTH\nWhen I first came to Bhagavan, I saw a bright light like the sun, with Bhagavan in the midst of it. Later on, I\nused to see a light between my eyebrows. On another occasion, I saw a big light come out from\nBhagavan's head and fill the hall. In that light, everything disappeared, including Bhagavan. Only the\nfeeling of 'I' remained, floating in a luminous void.\nWhen I related these experiences to Bhagavan, he said, 'Yes, such visions do occur. To know how you look\nyou must look into a mirror, but don't take that reflection to be yourself. What is perceived by our senses\nand the mind is never the truth. All visions are mere mental creations, and if you believe in them, your\nprogress ceases. Inquire to whom the visions occur. Find out who ~is their witness.

In Buddhism, many Zen masters advocate the practice of self-enquiry as a koan or\nhua-tou. In Dzogchen teachings, it is a part (although not the entirety) of the guru yoga method, at least\naccording to what was taught by the Dzogchen teacher Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, and guru yoga is\nconsidered the primary Dzogchen practice. Lama Surya Das equates Dzogchen's rushan (separating rigpa\nfrom sems) practice with self-inquiry – there’s a nice book that discusses dzogchen and self-enquiry\nmeditations which you can read, it is Natural Radiance: Awakening to Your Great Perfection -\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Natural-Radiance-Awakening-Great-Perfection/dp/1591792835. However I am\nnot implying that the Dzogchen Rushan methods are only restricted to the “I AM” realization, for example,\nI have learnt that many Dzogchen teachings and methods are aimed at realising anatta, etc. However,\naccording to the Dzogchen teacher Arcaya Malcolm, although unfabricated clarity is not the final realization\nof Dzogchen, it is the initial recognition of rigpa that serves as the basis for Dzogchen practice. In my\nexperience, self enquiry is a potent method to discover unfabricated clarity. In Hinduism, we also have\nfamous luminaries like Ramana Maharshi who advocate self-enquiry as the primary way to self-realization.\nAlso check out these pointers by Angelo Gerangelo: Awakening to Reality: Helper Pointers to I AM\nAwakening, etc by Angelo Gerangelo\nWhile asking Who am I?, do not dwell in conceptual answers but trace the radiance (of\nthoughts/sounds/sights/etc) back to the formless and luminous source, the Self (See: Chinul -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/Zen%20Master%20Chinul)\nIn Self-Enquiry - while asking Who am I?, everything you observe - the objects of five senses (vision, sounds,\nsensations, smells, tastes) as well as thoughts, feelings, emotions, mind, body, etc, are seen to be not me,\nnot this, not this (neti-neti).

So who are You?\"\n119\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSelf-Enquiry is called a direct path for a reason:\n“Don’t relate, don’t infer, don’t think. Authenticating ‘You’ yourself requires nothing of that. Not from\nteachers, books, Mahamudra, Dzogchen, Zen or even Buddha, whatever comes from outside is knowledge.\nWhat that come sfrom the innermost depth of your own beingness, is the wisdom of you yourself.\nThere is no need to look for any answers. Ultimately, it is your own essence and nature. To leap from the\ninferencing, deducting and relating mind into the most direct and immediate authentication, the mind must\ncease completely and right back into the place before any formation of artificialities. If this ‘eye’ of\nimmediacy isn’t open, everything is merely knowledge and opening this eye of direct perception is the\nbeginning of the path that is pathless. Ok enough of chats and there have been too much words. Don’t\nsway and walk on. Happy journey!’\n…\nMr. R, I have been very direct to you and it is just a simple question of what is your mind right now and\nnothing else. There is no other path more straightforward than that.\nI have told you to put aside, all thoughts, all teachings, even Dzogchen, Mahamudra, Zen and just [asked]\n‘what is your mind right now?’. Isn’t that telling you straight to the point, not wasting time and words? I have\nalso told you whatever comes from external is knowledge, put all those aside. Wisdom comes from within\nyourself directly. But you have cut and pasted me all the texts, conversations, Zen, Mahamudra, Dzogchen,\nMadhyamaka that I have told you to put aside.\nYou asked me what is my advice. Still the same. Don’t go after experiences and knowledge, you have read\nand known enough, so return back to simplicity. Your duty is not to know more, but to eliminate all these\nand [get] back to the simplicity of the direct taste. Otherwise you will have to waste a few more years or\ndecades to return back to what that is most simple, basic and direct.\nAnd from this simplicity and directness, you then allow your nature to reveal the breadth and depth\nthrough constantly authenticating it in all moments and all states through engagement in different\nconditions.\nSo unless you drop everything and [get] back into a clean, pure, basic simplicity, there is no real progress\nin practice. Until you understand the treasure of simplicity and start back from there, every step forward\nis a retrogress.“ – John Tan, 2020\n120\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nFor the purposes of contemplation for the first breakthrough awakening (the I AM), this pointer by Angelo\nDillulo (author of Awake: It’s Your Turn, he also realised deep insights further than the initial awakening\nand his pointers are clear) is important:\n“Inquiry for First Awakening\nThe inquiry that leads to first awakening is a funny thing. We want to know “how” precisely to do that\ninquiry, which is completely understandable. The thing is that it’s not wholly conveyable by describing a\ncertain technique. Really it’s a matter of finding that sweet spot where surrender and intention meet. I\nwill describe an approach here, but it’s important to keep in mind that in the end, you don’t have the\npower (as what you take yourself to be) to wake yourself up. Only Life has that power. So as we give\nourselves to a certain inquiry or practice it’s imperative that we remain open. We have to keep the\nportals open to mystery, and possibility. We have to recognize that the constant concluding that “no this\nisn’t it, no this isn’t it either...” is simply the activity of the mind. Those are thoughts. If we believe a single\nthought then we will believe the next one and on and on. If however we recognize that, “oh that doubt is\nsimply a thought arising now,” then we have the opportunity to recognize that that thought will subside\non its own... and yet “I” as the knower of that thought am still here! We can now become fascinated with\nwhat is here once that thought (or any thought) subsides. What is in this gap between thoughts? What is\nthis pure sense of I, pure sense of knowing, pure sense of Being? What is this light that can shine on and\nilluminate a thought (as it does thousands of times per day), and yet still shines when no thought is\npresent. It is self illuminating. What is the nature of the one that notices thoughts, is awake and aware\nbefore, during, and after a thought, and is not altered in any way by any thought? Please understand that\nwhen you ask these questions you are not looking for a thought answer, the answer is the experience\nitself.\nWhen we start to allow our attention to relax into this wider perspective we start to unbind ourselves\nfrom thought. We begin to recognize the nature of unbound consciousness by feel, by instinct. This is\nthe way in.\nAt first we may conclude that this gap, this thoughtless consciousness is uninteresting, unimportant. It\nfeels quite neutral, and the busy mind can’t do anything with neutral so we might be inclined to purposely\nengage thoughts again. If we recognize that “not interesting, not important, not valuable” are all thoughts\nand simply return to this fluid consciousness, it will start to expand. But there is no need to think about\nexpansion or watch for it. It will do this naturally if we stay with it. If you are willing to recognize every\nthought and image in the mind as such, and keep your attention alert but relaxed into the “stuff” of\nthought that is continuous with the sense of I, it will all take care of itself. Just be willing to suspend\njudgement. Be willing to forego conclusions. Be willing to let go of all monitoring of your progress,\nbecause these are all thoughts. Be open to the pure experience. Just return again and again to this place\nof consciousness with no object or pure sense of I Am. If you are willing to do this it will teach itself to you\nin a way that neither I nor anyone I’ve ever seen can explain, but it is more real than real.\n121\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nHappy Travels.\nArt by: Platon Yurich”\n“There is a Zen koan:\nComing empty-handed, going empty-handed—that is human. When you are born, where do you come\nfrom? When you die, where do you go? Life is like a floating cloud which appears. Death is like a floating\ncloud which disappears. The floating cloud itself originally does not exist. Life and death, coming and\ngoing, are also like that. But there is one thing which always remains clear. It is pure and clear, not\ndepending on life and death.\nThen what is the one pure and clear thing?” – Soh, 2021\n“Self-Inquiry instructions from the book 'Natural Radiance' - Lama Surya Das\n« Once your mind is calm, focused, lucid, and clear, abruptly turn the mind on itself—mind the mind and\nturn it inward, with laserlike self-inquiry questions: “Who is thinking my thoughts? Who is trying to\nmeditate? Who is it; what is it; where is it? Who is experiencing my experience right now?”\nThere is no need to analyze too much—just abruptly pop the question and observe what happens. Let go\nand see if you can startle yourself into a new way of seeing and being, short-circuiting your usual\noutward-looking, dualistic thought process of self and other. See through the seer, directly experience the\nexperiencer, and be free; rest in luminous centerless openness, the natural Great Perfection, pure\npresence, rigpa.\nAgain cutting even deeper, abruptly turn the mind upon itself again: Who is experiencing? Who and what\nis hearing? Who and what is seeing, thinking, and feeling? Who is having these physical sensations? Who\nis it; what is it; where is it? Is it in the head; is it in the body; is it in the heart; is it in the mind and\nconsciousness? Who is experiencing? Who or what am I? How is it happening? See if you can enter the\nbottomless gap between thoughts, beneath thoughts. See if you can directly experience whatever is not\nthought—the luminous awareness that exists prethought or beyond or beneath thought, or after all\nthought has ceased. Trace the source of all of your thoughts, feelings, experiences, physical sensations,\nand perceptions. Notice how they arise, and, after they arise, where they are in your present experience\nand where they go. See if you can follow the disillusion point back into the luminous void that is\ncenterless—the openness that is everything’s ultimate identity, the great Who, the great What that is\nknown as buddha nature. And if you cannot find anything to follow, just rest in that great silence, and be\nnothing for just one instant. Being nothing but pure awareness for an instant would be transformative in\nitself, and more than enough. Emaho!\nWhen the mind starts to move, as it will, and thoughts and feelings and physical sensations again begin to\nproliferate, turn the mind upon itself again instead of looking outward at outer phenomena, projections,\nand perceptions. Turn the searchlight inward and mind the mind, becoming more keenly aware of\nawareness itself. Continue this laserlike questioning of who and what is experiencing, who is thinking,\nwho is hearing, who, what, where, how and then let go and release—drop everything: drop body and\n122\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nmind—and sense who or what is present between thoughts and when thought has ceased, even for a\nmoment. If you discover that you really do not know who you are, then that is enough. That is what is true\nfor you in this moment, and that is sufficient truth for now.\nLama Surya Das. « Natural Radiance. » “\n“Soh Wei Yu\nAdmin\n· 4m ·\nI flipped through Three Pillars of Zen by Phillip Kapleau Roshi. Seems like there are many good\ninstructions on self-enquiry and self-realisation. Going to put it as a book recommendation in AtR guide.\n(It's also highly recommended by\nAngelo Gerangelo\n)\nAaron Dorje\nMy favourite book on Zen by a mile. Indeed, for me, a rare case in which one book covers almost\neverything you'd need to know about a particular area of Buddhism\nGuides to meditation (the one on the koan 'mu' helped me have a major En experience),\ndoctrine,\nteacher exchanges with students\nand wonderful stories of enlightenment (a rare thing: but its comforting that at least one tradition is\nevidence of the fact that a determined person can reach at least some of the enlightenments with a\ndetermined effort within a finite time).”\n“16th June 2010\nI answered someone's questions by e-mail regarding Self Inquiry practice.\nHi,\nQn: Thanks!\nCould you summarize your method for practice? As you know, I am very interested in obtaining I AM state. I am\ninterested in any method except Vipassana.\nSoh:\nThe I AM is already fully present right now, so much so that it is like asking 'how do I obtain my eyes?'. You\ncannot obtain your eye, you are already seeing with your eyes. It will be silly to go looking/searching\noutward (with your eyes) for your eyes. Similarly, it will be silly to go looking outward (through your Self)\nfor your Self. You just have to notice that all along, you are the seeing! You are the non objective Seer, so\n123\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nto go looking for your Self outside is to look into the wrong direction. So know that there is no need to\nlook for Awareness and Presence. It is simply a matter of pointing out, noticing, realizing that Awareness\nis already present and is what you are. It is a simple statement/description of fact, and not a prescription\nto go out and search for it. You will realize that You Are, and that is an ever-present fact that always has\nbeen so. When you realize, you realize you gained nothing new from it: you do not enter a new state, you\nsimply realize something you overlooked all along.\nNevertheless, the method is indeed important to give rise to realization. Any method that leads to\nrealization must be direct - means it must be a means that makes a practitioner bypass all the mind's\nconceptualizations and inference processes which are all indirect and secondary (which is not a direct\nrealization and experience of your true essence and hence leaves doubts), so that you can touch directly\nand with certainty the essence of your Being without intermediary. On hindsight there was a period when\nI first started practicing self-inquiry where I was still intellectualizing about this, like how should I practice\nself inquiry, what does asking 'Before birth Who am I' mean and leads to, etc, which are all sidetracks and\ndistractions because it is still using the mind and indirect inference and hence not a 'direct' approach to\nrealize the essence of Being.\nSo do beware of intellectualizing these things, because it will not lead to Self-Realization - only the direct\napproach to investigate and look (a non-conceptual exploration) into the essence of Self leads to\nrealization.\nAs you may have seen, my method of practice is self-inquiry. Self-Inquiry is the method that leads to\ndirect experience and realization of your own essence, presence-awareness, so that no doubts can arise\nany more, because that is clearly seen as a self-evident, solid, undeniable fact of your being. One thing to\nnote: having glimpses and recognitions of the I AM experience is not the same as having the realization –\nthe latter is more important. Something I think is quite important, which Thusness wrote to me last year\nwhen I have had glimpses and recognitions/experiences of the Witness, but not experienced the\nRealization, a.k.a. 'Certainty of Being' (also see the post I made on 14 May 2010, on the conversation I had\nwith Thusness about the different phases of I AM in February 2009): Realization and Experience and Non-\nDual Experience from Different Perspectives (see the first part)\nAs for the method of self inquiry, I wrote this on my forum about two weeks ago, highlighted in red:\nBegin by investigating this sense of existence, this sense of being. What is it? Who am I? This is not meant to be\nverbally or mentally recited (as Self-Inquiry teacher Zen/Ch'an Master Hsu Yun says, if you want to chant,\nchanting the name of Amitabha Buddha wholeheartedly will be more meritorious than chanting Who am I? or\nWho is chanting Buddha?), nor should it be an intellectual inquiry by engaging the mind in concepts to figure\nthings out. No. Rather it is a non-conceptual and non-verbal exploration, investigation, examination of this\nsense of Presence, what is this Self, what is true, beyond all thoughts and conceptualizations and images we\nhave about who I am. Your conceptualizing mind needs to calm down for true insight to arise (but calmness\nalone does not result in insight - inquiry does). The inquiry 'Who am I' is a tool to turn the attention inward, to\n124\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nturn the light around and investigate our essential being so that direct realization of this 'I', Beingness, AMness\ncan occur.\nKeep inquiring in that manner until unshakeable conviction arises through a sudden illumination: the\nundoubtable sense that I AM, which is beyond all thoughts and concepts - this undeniable, undoubtable sense\nof presence and existence that is at the same time aware and knows itself and aware of everything. It is both\npresent, and aware. As I wrote: You Are That Knowing which is certain that You Are! The distinction between\nknower, knowing, and known dissolve into That. You Are That!\nAfter this realization, your understanding of spirituality will not remain intellectual/conceptual.\nHowever this is just the beginning, as Thusness said before in Realization and Experience and Non-Dual\nExperience from Different Perspectives: “this realization is not an end by itself, it is the beginning. If we are\ntruthful and not over exaggerate and get carried away by this initial glimpse, we will realize that we do not gain\nliberation from this realization; contrary we suffer more after this realization. However it is a powerful condition\nthat motivates a practitioner to embark on a spiritual journey in search of true freedom.”\nFor me, I was asked by Thusness to contemplate on the koan \"Before birth, Who am I?\"\nThis was the koan that led both I and him to the realization of I AMness.\nEssentially what you have to ask is 'Who am I?' Trace the radiance to its source. You are aware and\npresent, this is undoubtable and undeniable. So Who/What is Aware? Trace the radiance to the source.\nYou hear sounds of bird chirping, so Who/What is Hearing? Turn the light around, trace the radiance to\nthe source, listen to the listener, investigate 'What Listens', until you can say with absolute certainty and\nconviction that you realized your true nature.

It is always bright and never obscured.\nChinul: What is this essence which is not empty?\nStudent: Words cannot describe it.”\nWhen walking, you can notice that the body in itself is inert like a log, after the life force has left the body\nafter death the body becomes a corpse. But right now, your body is alive and functioning well, so next\ntime when you are walking or jogging on the street you can inquire on 'Who is dragging this corpse\nalong?' Certainly the corpse cannot walk or move by itself without the power of the\nSource/Consciousness/Life. What is this core/source of aliveness? Who is it?\nSo you can do self inquiry in all kinds of situations: hearing a bird chirping (or experiencing anything else -\nwho/what is aware?), walking on the street (who is dragging this corpse along?), or simply sitting\nmeditation (just ask Before birth, Who am I?), etc. Before birth does not need to trigger imagination of\nwhat existed in time before your birth such as what happened 100 or 1000 years ago or at the big bang, it\nis much simpler and immediate than that. It is about finding out what you are before notions of time\narise, it is about finding out what are you at/as this instant presence before a moment of thought occurs,\nno rumination is required. Anything perceived through the five senses such as your hands and legs are\nstuff given birth by your parents decades ago, but what are you prior to what is perceivable by the five\n126\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nsenses or imaginable by thought? Don’t look at the past for an answer, look at You as this instant\nPresence. A popular koan nowadays is \"Who is chanting Buddha?\" but I don't ask this because I seldom\nchant in the first place, so it may not be as powerful/appropriate for my situation. But whatever it is, it still\ncomes down to this... keep turning the light around and investigate Who am I? I do not want to give\npeople too much to anticipate or expect, but based on my own experience and Thusness's, and\nobservations of others practicing self inquiry, that practice should lead to realization in a few years of\npractice. It could even be a few months of diligent practice... it depends. You must be very interested to\nknow the truth of your being, to resolve the matter of Who You Are. I believe this is what Zen means by\n'great doubt leads to great realization'. The initial realization should not take too long, though there is a\nlong process of deepening/unfolding of further insights.\np.s. For Self-Inquiry taught in Ch'an/Zen, check out Ch'an Master Hsu Yun's teachings.\nFor Self-Inquiry taught in Advaita, Ramana Maharshi comes to mind.\nBut there is no essential difference in method taught as far as self inquiry is concerned as taught between\nthese two teachers, as far as I know.\nQn: BTW, does you or Thusness have the power to help out people like me?\nExcerpt from\nhttp://nisargadattasmessage.blogspot.com/2006/11/gleanings-from-nisargadatta-now.html\n\"Nisargadatta Maharaj told me the only way you can help anyone is to take them beyond the need for\nfurther help and he did that by showing me what I was not....this body and mind. - He did not and could\nnot show me or explain to me what is the Truth or actual Reality of all things. because That cannot be put\ninto words or seen as an object. - I had to do my own inner work and see the Truth for myself. - See and\nacknowledge this present awareness that you cannot negate or grasp and you too will be beyond the\nneed for further help. - No guru, new age spiritual master, or outer teacher can do it for you, you have to\nsee it for yourself.............\"” - Soh’s E-Journal entry in 2010\nSomeone shared on Reddit: “Turn the Light Around\nOne of the most frequent instructions ZMs gave is to turn our light around.\nSengcan\n>To return to the root is to find the meaning, but to pursue appearances is to miss the source. At the\nmoment of turning the light of awareness around, there is going beyond appearance and emptiness.\nLinji:\n127\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n>You must right now turn your light around and shine it on yourselves, not go seeking somewhere else.\nThen you will understand that in body & mind you are no different from the ancestors and buddhas, and\nthat there is nothing to do.\nYuanwu:\n>The most important thing is for people of great faculties and sharp wisdom to turn the light of mind\naround and shine back and clearly awaken to this mind before a single thought is born...Turn the light\naround and reflect back. Your true nature is clear and still and as-it-is. Empty through and accept it.\nHongzhi:\n>Take the backward step and directly reach the middle of the circle from where the light issues forth.\nIn case you're not familiar with this instruction and haven't tried it, turning the light around means to\n\"take the backwards step\" by stopping our typical mode of leaning forward into our experiences of\nthoughts, emotions, and sensory data, and instead direct our attention \"backward\" to our pure being (i.e.\nbecome aware of our own existence, focused on the feeling of \"I am,\" the light of presence-awareness,\nthe ground of the mind, etc.).\nWhat's interesting is that these same instructions appear again and again across many traditions.\nTaoist Master Lu Yan:\n>Turning the light around is not turning around the light of one body, but turning around the very energy\nof creation...If you can look back again and again into the source of mind, whatever you are doing, not\nsticking to any image of person or self at all, then this is turning the light around wherever you are. This is\nthe finest practice.\nTilopa (Pith Instructions to Naropa on Mahamudra):\n>When you look at the center of the sky, seeing will cease. Likewise, when mind looks at mind, the\nswarms of thoughts cease and unsurpassable enlightenment is attained.\nRamana Maharshi:\n>“If the mind (the attention) is thus well fixed in sadhana (attending to Self), a power of divine Grace will\nthen rise from within of its own accord and, Subjugating the mind, will take it to the Heart”. What is this\npower of divine Grace ? It is nothing but the perfect clarity of our existence the form of the Supreme Self\n(paramatman), ever shining with abundant Grace in the heart.\nNisargadatta Maharaj:\n128\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n>Establish yourself firmly in the awareness of ‘I am’. This is the beginning and also the end of all\nendeavor.\nWhat's captured my attention recently is that these same instructions, this same practice, is prescribed as\nsomething to do both before and after awakening.\nHuineng:\n>If in all places whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, your pure unified direct mind does not\nmove from the site of enlightenment, truly making a pure land, this is called absorption in one practice.\nYuanwu:\n>Just keep boring in -- you must penetrate through completely. Haven't you seen Muzhou's saying? 'If you\nhaven't gained entry, you must gain entry. Once you have gained entry, don't turn your back on your old\nteacher.' When you manage to work sincerely and preserve your wholeness for a long time, and you go\nthrough a tremendous process of smelting and forging and refining and polishing in the furnace of a true\nteacher, you grow nearer and more familiar day by day, and your state becomes secure and continuous.\nKeep working like this, maintaining your focus for a long time still, to make your realization of\nenlightenment unbroken from beginning to end.\n>...You must continue this way without interruption forever - this is the best.\nFor me, this is my current day-to-day practice, trying to maintain it at all times. I \"build the muscle\" by\ndoing this in seated practice for 30 minutes or so, giving myself quiet space to get acquainted and then\ncome back to it again and again throughout the day as I remember. I'm really enjoying it, but it's tough\nbecause there's no real \"anchor\" like in more traditional forms of meditation. It's being rather than doing.\nWhat are your experiences with turning the light around? Does it make sense to you? Is this something\nyou have done or currently do?\nIf you haven't tried this, what are you waiting for?”\nI started having glimpses of I AMness since 2007, but it wasn’t until early 2010 that I came to a point of\ntotal certainty or doubtless Self-Realization. Here’s an example of a glimpse and John Tan’s advise:\n“Session Start: Sunday, 25 October, 2009\n(2:07 AM) AEN: just now it occurred to me that the places i've been are hazy like a dream, they come\nand go.... then i realised my thoughts also are like a dream, they come and go... when i dropped that\ntheres only my own existence and presence left which is real and not hazy at all and doesnt come and go\n(2:34 AM) AEN: then for a short while i was only aware of my own existence... until i got distracted :P\n129\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(5:16 AM) Thusness: not bad... :) That is the beginning phase of I AM.\n(5:19 AM) Thusness: first drop your thoughts, drop all sort of mental chattering, drop everything, don't\nthink of non-dual. Allow yourself to be filled with only this sense of existence. This is the first phase.\n(5:19 AM) AEN: icic..\n(5:20 AM) Thusness: then you will realize what existence is. ”\n“My Guru ordered me to attend to the sense 'I am' and to give attention to nothing else. I just obeyed. I\ndid not follow any particular course of breathing, or meditation, or study of scriptures. Whatever\nhappened, I would turn away my attention from it and remain with the sense 'I am'. It may look too\nsimple. My Guru told me: ‘...Go back to that state of pure being, where the ‘I am’ is still in its purity before\nit got contaminated with ‘I am this’ or ‘I am that.’ Your burden is of false self-identifications—abandon\nthem all. Trust me, I tell you: you are Divine. Take it as the absolute truth. Your joy is divine, your suffering\nis divine too. All comes from God. Remember it always. You are God, your will alone is done.’ I did believe\nhim and soon realized how wonderfully true and accurate were his words. I did not condition my mind by\nthinking, \"I am God, I am wonderful, I am beyond.\" I simply followed his instruction, which was to focus\nthe mind on pure being, \"I am,\" and stay in it. I used to sit for hours together, with nothing but the \"I am\"\nin my mind and soon the peace and joy and deep all-embracing love became my normal state. In it all\ndisappeared—myself, my guru, the life I lived, the world around me. Only peace remained, and\nunfathomable silence.“ – Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj\n“When I say 'I AM', I do not mean a separate entity with a body as its nucleus. I mean the totality of Being,\nthe ocean of consciousness, the entire universe of all that is and knows. I have nothing to desire for I am\ncomplete forever.”\n- Nisargadatta Maharaj, I AM THAT ch 36\n“Self Enquiry, Neti Neti and the Process of Elimination -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/05/self-enquiry-neti-neti-and-process-of.html\nI often say, self enquiry is not a mantra. It's not something you just repeat mentally \"who am i.. who am\ni...\" it's not that sort of practice. It is an investigation, an exploration, an inquiry into the true nature of\nidentity and the true nature of consciousness.\nThe inquiry/koan \"Before Birth, who am I?\" has a dual purpose: the elimination of all conceptual\nidentification (ego) and to discover one's underlying radiant Consciousness, or Pure Presence/Beingness.\nDuring my journey of self-enquiry, which spanned over two years (2008-Feb 2010), involving meditative\ncontemplations such as “before birth, who am I?” During the process, this line of questioning, we\neliminate all the candidates for my self -- I am not my hands, my legs, my name, my thoughts. They come\nand go and are observed, they are not me. So what am I? As John Tan said before, “you cannot know the\n130\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“Ultimate Source” without the process of elimination”. What does it eliminate? The conceptual\nidentification of self with various mentally constructed and perceived objects. This is why \"before birth\" is\nasked, as it directs the mind to this elimination. And what does that elimination reveal? Who am I, what is\nthis radiant Being that stands alone revealed after that process of elimination?\nRamana Maharshi said:\n\"1. Who am I ?\nThe gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense\norgans, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects,\nviz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense- organs, viz. the organs of\nspeech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions\nspeaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform\nrespectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the\nnescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no\nobjects and no functioning’s, I am not.\n2. If I am none of these, then who am I?\nAfter negating all of the above-mentioned as ‘not this’, ‘not this’, that Awareness which alone remains -\nthat I am.\n3. What is the nature of Awareness?\nThe nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss\"\n- continue reading at https://app.box.com/s/v8r7i8ng17cxr1aoiz9ca1jychct6v84\nThis line of questioning (before birth, who am I?) led me to a moment in silent meditation where\neverything subsided, leaving only a doubtless unshakeable certainty of pure existence and presence.\nSo eliminating concepts until none is left with some prompting like self enquiry or zen koan will allow one\nto reach a complete state of stillness (stillness of the conceptual mind) and authenticate\npresence/clarity/radiance directly.\nWhile this method effectively dissolves conceptual attachments and reveals the radiant core of\nConsciousness, it fails to address the view of inherency and the dualities of subject and object or the\ndeeper insight of both self and phenomena as merely nominal and overcome views that reifies the four\nextremes. Sometimes we call it \"inherentness\" in short, and inherentness means concepts being reified\nand mistaken as real. But that requires deeper insights and realisations and is crucial for releasing the\n131\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ndeeper afflictive and knowledge obscurations. Merely the pausing of conceptual thinking or even\nrevealing one's Radiance is insufficient to realise its nature.\nAt this point, after radiance is realized, as John Tan points out, \"before we can hop into the next path and\nfocus on radiance and natural state, without recognizing implication of conventional and seeing through\nthem, there will be ongoing cognitive as well as emotional obscurations. How deep and far can you go?\nMuch less talking about natural state when one can't even distinguish what is conventional and what is\nultimate.\"\nAs John Tan said before,\n“When we authenticate radiance clarity directly, we have a first hand experiential taste of what is called\nthe \"ultimate free from all conceptual elaborations\" but mind is not \"free from conceptual elaborations\".”\nI also wrote some time back:\n\"Seeing selfness or cognizance as a subject and phenomena as objects is the fundamental elaboration\nthat prevents the taste of appearances as radiance clarity.. then even after anatta, there are still the\nsubtle cognitive obscurations that reified phenomena, arising and ceasing, substantial cause and effect,\ninherent production and so on.\nSo elaboration is not just coarse thinking like labelling but to me is like a veil of reification projecting and\ndistorting radiant appearances and its nature.\nAnother way to put it is that the fundamental conceptual elaboration that obscures reality/suchness is to\nreify self and phenomena in terms of the extremes of existence and non existence through not\napprehending the nature of mind/appearance.\n...\nIf you mean just authenticate radiance clarity like I AM, then it’s just nonconceptual taste and realisation\nof presence.\nThat moment is nondual and nonconceptual and unfabricated but it doesnt mean the view of inherency\nis seen through. Since fundamental ignorance is untouched the radiance will continue to be distorted into\na subject and object.\"\n\"The process of eradicating avidyā (ignorance) is conceived… not as a mere stopping of thought, but as\nthe active realization of the opposite of what ignorance misconceives. Avidyā is not a mere absence of\nknowledge, but a specific misconception, and it must be removed by realization of its opposite. In this\nvein, Tsongkhapa says that one cannot get rid of the misconception of 'inherent existence' merely by\nstopping conceptuality any more than one can get rid of the idea that there is a demon in a darkened\n132\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ncave merely by trying not to think about it. Just as one must hold a lamp and see that there is no demon\nthere, so the illumination of wisdom is needed to clear away the darkness of ignorance.\" - Napper,\nElizabeth, 2003, p. 103\"\nIt is important however to note that Gelug and non Gelug authors may have different definitions of\nconceptualities, as John Tan pointed out years ago: “Not exactly, both have some very profound points.\nMipham \"conceptualities\" is not only referring to symbolic layering but also self-view which is more\ncrucial. Mipham made it very clear and said the gelug mistake \"conceptualities\" as just symbolic and\nmental overlay, which is not what he is referring then he laid down 3 types of conceptualities. Same for\ndharmakirti also...there is the gross definition and the more refine definitions.”\nHowever, for the purpose of beginners trying to realize the I AM, just going through and focusing on self-\nenquiry and the process of elimination mentioned earlier is sufficient to result in Self Realisation.\nYou should read this article https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/the-direct-path-to-your-real-\nself.html as this author was able to bring several to the realization of I AM, and explains well the process\nof self enquiry and the process of elimination.\nQuestion: “ Thank you Soh, much appreciated.\nI'm familiar with some of the material but i'll work my way through it all again.\nCan you say anything more specifically about the quality of the question \"what is aware of self\" as\nopposed to \"who am I\"? If it leaves me in an \"emptier\" experience is it necessarily a better question for\nme, or is it important to keep trying to deconstruct that ickily shifting sense of self that \"who am I\" points\nat?”\nSoh replied: “ Who am i doesnt point at sense of self, it lets you see that the sense of self is not in fact who\nyou are. You are what is aware and prior to that sense of self. So all objects conceived or perceived that is\nmistaken as Self are naturally negated as neti neti - not this, not this. And so you revert back to the\nSource, or the pure Beingness prior to all concepts and sense of self.\nWho am i points at the pure I-I prior to all conceived sense of self and perceived objects. In other words it\npoints to the same thing as “what is aware” is pointing at.\nThe fact that the sense of self is as you put it, “ickily shifting” is already a hint to you that it is not in fact\nwho you truly are at all, it is not your true self. So inquiring who am I naturally negates that shifting sense\nof self as being a possible candidate for who you are. And so seeing this you naturally deconstruct that\nand trace back to the Source in self enquiry.”\n133\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/207646316294607/posts/2330941190631765/ -\n\"THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT KNOWS, \"I AM\"\nRamana Maharshi describes the sense of 'I' as the fundamental, self-evident awareness that is always\npresent. It is the consciousness that knows, \"I am.\" This 'I' is not the body, mind, or ego but the pure,\nunchanging awareness that underlies all experiences. Ramana often refers to this as the 'I-I' or the true 'I'.\nTo know that it is the true 'I' Ramana speaks of, one must recognize that it is ever-present and self-\nluminous. Unlike the transient thoughts and sensations that come and go, this 'I' remains constant. It is\nthe silent witness to all that occurs without being affected by it. When all thoughts and identifications with\nthe body and mind are relinquished through self-inquiry, what remains is this pure sense of being.\nRamana advises that through persistent self-inquiry, asking \"Who am I?\" and turning attention inward, the\nfalse identifications fall away. The true 'I' reveals itself not as an object to be seen but as the very essence\nof our existence. It is experienced as a deep, inherent sense of presence and peace, devoid of attributes,\ndistinctions, or forms.\nIn essence, this sense of 'I' is simply the state of pure awareness, the unchanging consciousness that is\nalways present. Knowing it is the true 'I' comes from the direct experience of this unbroken, self-evident\nawareness that transcends all temporary experiences and phenomena.\"\nDo watch this: https://youtu.be/ZYjI6gh9RxE?si=6M4zn5tHE7fQlJcr\nAlso watch this: https://youtu.be/MTvyLfCd9jI?si=9sUAHomIpD76iQn-\nLabels: Conceptuality, Freedom from Elaborations, I AMness, Self Enquiry |”\nWriting to Mother on Meditation and Self-Enquiry (with Comments on Anatta Below)\n• Soh Wei Yu\n46m ·\nShared with Your friends\n134\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nMeditation and Self-Enquiry\nI wrote this to my mother today in Chinese about the purpose of practicing and to encourage her\nto meditate.

One must reach a\nstate of utter doubtlessness/certainty to be considered '[Self-]Realization'.\nAfter the utter cessation of all thoughts, one must turn one's light around to find out, What am I?\nWhat is it that is Aware? If there is a thought which answers 'it is this or that' then that's wrong,\nbecause the real answer lies not in words and letters. Therefore cast aside those thoughts and\ncontinue inquiring, turning the light around. This is the most direct method to apprehend one's\nMind.\nYou should meditate everyday. Master Yuan Yin asks his student to meditate two hours a day.\n135\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIf you are unable to quiet your mind to a state of no-thought, it will be difficult to realise. You\nshould think carefully what is the best method for you to still your mind? Is it meditation? Or is it\nchanting the Buddha's name and reciting mantras? Whatever methods which calms the mind will\ndo, but you have to practice everyday, not only practice intermittently or occasionally.\nHowever, reaching a state of no-thought is not awakening. Upon reaching a state of no-thought,\ncontinue turning the light around to find out Who is that which is the Clear Knowingness? What is\nit? Then you will realise your Self-Nature. Otherwise your meditation is merely a state of stillness,\nnot yet realising Self-Nature.\nRealizing Self-Nature is only Apprehending one's Mind, it is not yet realizing Nature [the nature of\nmind and phenomena] (the principle of the twofold emptiness of persons and phenomena as\nrealized by a first bhumi Bodhisattva), therefore one must continue. Hence, \"Apprehending Mind\nand Realising Nature\" consists of two parts: first apprehend one's Mind (True Mind), later realize\n[Empty] Nature.\nTherefore practice hard to Apprehend Mind and Realize Nature.\nThe Sixth Ch'an Patriarch said: It is useless to learn the dharma without recognising original Mind.\nBe Still and Know that I AM / Self-Enquiry\n•\nSoh Wei Yu The I AM is not about having an experience, it is about discovering and realizing what You\nare.

But, we\ndon't want to let that dominate our spirituality. Because as I witnessed, the intensity of the living inquiry\nthat's more important than all the techniques.\nWhen somebody Just Has To Know. Even if that's kind of driving them half crazy for a while. And, that\nattitude is as important or more important than all the ways we work with that attitude, you know, the\nspiritual practices, the meditations and various inquiries and various different things, sort of practices. If\nwe engage in the practices because they are practices, you know like, ok I just do these because this is\nwhat I'm told to do, and hopefully it will have some good effect. That's different than being engaged,\nwhen you're actually being deeply interested in what you're inquiring about, and what you're actually\nmeditating upon. It's that quality of real, actual interest, something even more than interest. It is a kind of\ncompulsion, I know I was saying earlier don't get taken in by compulsion, but there is/can be a kind of\ncompulsion. And that's as valuable as anything else going on in you, actually.\"\n- Adyashanti\nThis is related to Zen's great doubt, great faith and great perseverance. Especially the aspect of Great\nDoubt.” – Soh, 2020\n“ANNAMALAI SWAMI – FINAL TALKS\n'YOYou SEEM TO BE LACKING INTENSITY'\nQ: Bhagavan wanted to know the answer to the question 'Who am I?' He seemed to find the answer\nstraight away. When I ask the question when I try to find out what the Self is, I can reject thoughts that\narise as being 'not me’, but nothing else happens. I don't get the answer that Bhagavan did, so I am\nbeginning to wonder why I am asking the question.\nAnnamalai Swami: You say that you are not getting the right answer.\n--- Who is this 'you'? Who is not getting the right answer? ---\nQuestion: Why should I ask? Asking has not produced the right answer so far.\nAnnamalai Swami: You should persist and not give up so easily. When you intensely inquire 'Who am I?'\nthe intensity of your inquiry takes you to the real Self. It is not that you are asking the wrong question.\nYou seem to be lacking intensity in your inquiry. You need a one-pointed determination to complete this\ninquiry properly. Your real Self is not the body or the mind. You will not reach the Self while thoughts are\ndwelling on anything that is connected with the body or the mind.\nQuestion: So it is the intensity of the inquiry that determines whether I succeed or not.\nAnnamalai Swami: Yes. If the inquiry into the Self is not taking place thoughts will be on the body and the\nmind. And while those thoughts are habitually there, there will be an underlying identification: ‘I am the\nbody; I am the mind.' This identification is something that happened at a particular point in time. It is not\n141\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nsomething that has always been there. And what comes in time also goes eventually, for nothing that\nexists in time is permanent.\nThe Self, on the other hand, has always been there. It existed before the ideas about the body and the\nmind arose, and it will be there when they finally vanish. The Self always remains as it is: as peace,\nwithout birth, without death.\nThrough the intensity of your inquiry, you can claim that state as your own.\nInquire into the nature of the mind by asking, with one-pointed determination, 'Who am I?' Mind is\nillusory and non-existent, just as the snake that appears on the rope is illusory and non-existent.\nDispel the illusion of the mind by intense inquiry and merge in the peace of the Self. That is what you are,\nand that is what you always have been.\nLWB, p. 41”\nSomeone asked: “Yeah though I think at this stage to reach the first I AM realization I’d like to embark on\nthe direct path rather than the gradual path. I’ve read Ramana, Arya, Rupert Spira etc. and have a basic\nunderstanding of self inquiry. I have found it frustrating though because unlike noting in vipassana, I\ndon’t know what to do after my mind just blanks to the question “who am I” (since intellectually i can\ncomprehend no self and that I’m not my thoughts/feelings etc). I don’t know if with self inquiry one feels a\nsense of progress like those that could come with vipassana ala ingram’s map? I guess I would like to\npersist with self inquiry but have a bad feeling that the method isn’t for me right now, but have no way of\nknowing...\nAnd yes I’ve read eckhart tolle.

Develop the ability to\nblend your experience of meditative equipoise with postmeditation activity. Do not relinquish your\ndiligence until you have accomplished your goal. Develop the ability to appreciate the equal taste of\nwhatever you encounter, whether it is to be eliminated or relied on.”\n“Soh: In my practice, there was a rather relentless inquiry to penetrate the truth of Being. This earnest\ninquiry keeps building up and up until it becomes a giant Great Doubt and mass of energy that propels its\ninquiry into not only sitting but even in walking, in daily activities -- Who am I??? Who is the one dragging\n144\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nthis corpse along?? A very earnest zeal to penetrate the core of the matter and discover what my true\nEssence is.\nSo in sitting meditation, there was of course silence, but an inward attention to the core of\nBeing/Presence/Existence, dwelling into that, discovering what that is, inquiring, etc. It was not so much\nan intellectual analysis but a drive to discover what I truly am before everything else -- before birth, what\nam I? Before thinking, what am I? Or just, who am I?\nThat, I say, is the direct path to Self-Realization.\nSo the emphasis is on discovering what is the Presence and Existence in the midst of silence, the\nemphasis is not on stillness, silence, as in a mental quiescence, which one can also achieve in other forms\nof mundane meditation that does not necessarily result in self-realization.\nThat being said, there are also those who define 'Silence' as inclusive of that aspect of Pure Presence,\nthen realizing that with certainty is no different from the I AM/Self-Realization. Then that is correctly\nidentifying/discovering the luminous essence. As Tenzin Wangyal said, \"The gap between two thoughts is\nessence. But if in that gap there is a lack of presence, it becomes ignorance and we experience only a lack\nof awareness, almost an unconsciousness. If there is presence in the gap, then we experience the\ndharmakaya [the ultimate].\"\nAlso,\n“If the natural strength of awareness is not brought forth, a numb and inert state of stillness will never\nyield any progress whatsoever. So, it is crucial to bring forth the steady clarity of awareness.”\n—Padmasambhava\nLike this website:\nhttp://www.puresilence.org/what_is_pure_silence.htm\n“What is Pure Silence?\nThere is a space within us, our brain, our being, which is and has always been there. This is the awareness\nwhich you have known all your life. It is your realization that you are. It is the same which has been at\nyour birth, during your youth, now and when you will be dead. This is your \"you-ness.\" Some have called\nthis your true self. This is something that, no matter what has occurred in your life, has never changed.\nYes, this has been permanent in you. You must see this. It's very hard to put all this into accurate words\nthat describe this fully and it is even more difficult to imagine this. But if you stop reading now, close your\neyes, and see what is there, you may begin to taste this. What is always there in you, despite your moods,\nyour emotions, your thoughts? I know you know this. See what is there at the core of your being. It seems\n145\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nyou and the rest of humanity have spent your entire lives running from this, fearing this, covering this. I\ndo not know all the reasons why. Perhaps our brains have not evolved enough yet.\nYou have probably followed some belief, some tradition, someone else's words or teaching. But I offer\nyou something else. Let go of the thoughts, the imagination, the emotions; let go of everything and see\nwhat is left. Do this, not because I am telling you this, but because it is truly what you want to find out\nonce and for all. You want to know. I know you do. What is this thing called existence all about? And more\nthan that, what is your place in all this? Who are you? What is your purpose?\nPure Silence is within you. It is not just the absence of sound, or lack of noise. It is the ground, the basis of\nyour very being. There is nothing to find out, nothing to prove. Just listen with your whole being to what is\nhere, now. It is the most amazing thing you can ever discover.\nIt is with you now. It is you. The only way to find this is to stop everything else. Everything! Just be!”\n“What you are in essence is self-shining, pure intelligence. The very idea of shining implies a movement.\nMovement is energy. I call it ‘pure intelligence energy’. It is shining through your eyes. You cannot say\nwhat it is, and you cannot negate it either. It is ‘no thing’. It cannot be objectified. It ever expresses as that\nliving, vibrant sense of presence, which translates through the mind as the thought ‘I am’. The primary\nthought ‘I am’ is not the reality. It is the closest the mind or thought can ever get to reality, for reality to\nthe mind is inconceivable. It is no thing.\nWithout the thought ‘I am’, is it stillness? Is it silence? Or is there a vibrancy about it, a livingness, a self-\nshining. All these expressions are mental concepts or pointers towards it, but the bottom line is that you\nknow that you are. You cannot negate that knowing that you are. It is not a dead, empty, silent stillness. It\nis not about keeping the mind silent, but seeing that what is prior to the mind is the livingness itself. It is\nvery subtle. When you see that that is what you are, then the very subtleness expresses itself. That is the\nuncaused joy. Nisargadatta puts it beautifully. He puts it in the negative: ‘There is nothing wrong any\nmore’. We think that we have to attain something and then stay there. Realize that you have never left it\nat any time. It is effortless. You don’t have to try or strive or grasp or hold. You are That!”\n- Sailor Bob Adamson\n“I AM not speaking to any 'body'.\nI AM not speaking to any 'mind'.\nI AM speaking to THAT I AM that I AM,\nto that PRESENCE AWARENESS,\nthat expresses through\nthe mind as the thought I AM.\nJust THIS, NOTHING else.”\n146\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n- Sailor Bob Adamson\nAngelo Gerangelo:\n“Self-Inquiry\nWe’ve already touched on the question “Who am I?” a couple times. Now we’re going to take that point of\ninquiry and supercharge it. We’ll use this self-inquiry vehicle as a sort of depth charge. Its purpose is to\nplunge you down through all those layers of belief and personal narrative, right to the core of identity. If\nwe do this the right way, it will detonate when it reaches that core. This detonation will blow a hole right\nthrough the bottom. “The bottom of what?” You might ask. The bottom of everything. We are going to\nblow a hole right through the bottom of reality. You didn’t come all this way for nothing right?\n“Blowing a hole through the bottom” is obviously a metaphor. The transformation that we’re referring to\nis so radical that even dimension (bottom, top, near, far) will be seen to be an illusion. Still, it’s a\nreasonably apt description. After my own awakening, these were the exact words that occurred to me. A\ncouple of days into reality as I knew it dismantling itself, I was talking to a friend about what had\nhappened. I knew I couldn’t adequately put into words what had taken place. I also knew it was\nimpossible to describe what had replaced the struggle and isolation I had previously considered “normal\nlife.” Yet my friend could sense that something had dramatically changed in me, and asked what had\nhappened. The words came, “I was meditating and the bottom fell out.” It was exactly like this. Oddly\nenough, when the bottom fell out, there was nothing for everything to fall into. The framework of reality\nas I had known it had completely deconstructed itself. What was left was something like a deep and\npervasive peace, and that’s how it remains. It’s obvious that whatever I thought was real before was only a\nvery small “model” of reality, something like a shadow on a wall. I had stumbled upon a possibility, a way\nof investigating perception, that completely altered the way I experience reality.\nSelf inquiry has the power to bring this about for anyone who is willing to take the plunge. By imbibing it\nwith the will to awaken to our true nature, we give the self-inquiry vehicle power beyond the limits of\nwhat we are capable of on our own. In this way, the inquiry becomes something of a portal or a conduit\nthrough which we can come into contact with forces altogether beyond the limits of the human\ndimension. Once this happens, you can no longer know yourself in the limited and definite way you had\npreviously learned to perceive yourself. Your identity will find a new equilibrium with unbound\nconsciousness, which is essentially limitless. The limitless experience of consciousness-Being, while\nastounding, is but the staging area for the more radical unfolding ahead. Yet it is a very important\nmilestone in the process of realization.\nLike any catalyst, this method of self inquiry functions best when the environmental conditions are\nfavorable. Let’s spend some time discussing the optimal conditions to support this process before we will\ndelve into the mechanics of the inquiry itself. Here are the conditions:\nAlert: This inquiry works best if we are alert, without straining. You don’t want to be slack with your\nattention, daydreaming, or mind-wandering. On the other hand, it’s unnecessary to be hyper-vigilant or to\nstrain your attention into a hyper-focused state. You want to be alert enough to assure that nothing\n147\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nescapes your attention, including any thought. A relaxed and dilated (open) attention, engaged in the\nprocess of inquiry is ideal. It is something like driving an automobile in a city you are unfamiliar with.\nUnlike taking a long drive down the highway where you might zone out or daydream a bit, driving in an\nunfamiliar city requires you to keep your attention on the immediate environment. You won’t be\ndaydreaming or imagining events and places that aren’t in your current experience. It can take a bit of\npractice to strike the right balance of alertness and relaxation. Keep practicing and you will find that\nsweet spot where you are neither daydreaming nor straining.\nCurious: Genuine curiosity is necessary for this approach to work. It’s my responsibility to relate the\nmechanics of this inquiry in a way that compels genuine curiosity. It’s up to you to be willing to\nacknowledge that innocent curiosity and proceed from it. We often circumvent natural curiosity by\nmoving our attention to a familiar but artificial mental construct when we find ourselves in the unknown.\nWe do this to feel some sense of certainty. This means that when faced with the unknown we often cling\nto old habituated patterns of thinking to help us avoid admitting to ourselves that we really don’t know.\nWhen this technique is applied correctly you will find yourself in the unknown rather quickly. The paradox\nhere is that using thought to “cure” that sense of unknowing will undermine the inquiry. A willingness to\nremain in unguarded curiosity is the lamp that lights the way forward.\nEmpirical: One definition of empirical is, “Verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or\nlogic.” When conducting self-inquiry, it’s best to forego comparing your experience to any idealized\nexperience or expectation. We’re here to discover. So any description we’ve read or heard about what is\nsupposed to happen when we self-inquire is useless. We’re only interested in what we directly discover. If\nyou’re willing to take a strictly empirical approach, then only immediate, obvious, and self-explanatory\nexperience matters. When you really get the spirit of this, it is quite a relief. How nice it is to not to have to\nstress over whether your experience is the “right” one. In a sense you’re putting realization in the hot seat.\nYou’re saying, “OK, I trust that you really can show me something that is beyond my own capacity to\nconstruct as a mental image. I will keep my slate clean and not compare my experience to any ideal,\nregardless of where I acquired that ideal.”\nFresh: - When you begin this inquiry just let go of everything you know. Let go of past inquiries and\nresults. Let go of any insights you might have had, even the last time you meditated or engaged in inquiry.\nIn fact, let go of what happened five minutes ago. Just this one question. Just this one experiential\nobservation. Do this every time you return to inquiry. Better yet, do this as you go about inquiry. It’s like\nwriting on a chalkboard and there is an eraser immediately following the chalk. In this way every moment\nis fresh. Every time a question is asked, it’s asked from complete innocence and unknowing. We carry no\nbaggage in this way. When we free ourselves up from the bondage of the past, we are free to synchronize\nwith the moment to moment flow of reality.\nConsistent: Initially, you might approach this inquiry during seated meditation, or when you feel inclined\nto introspect. Over time, as the curiosity and desire to wake up build, you will find that you can carry this\ninquiry with you for longer periods of time. You might be surprised as it becomes quite enjoyable to carry\nthis throughout daily activities such as cooking, working, exercising, and even talking with others. With\nconsistency a certain momentum builds. When I was close to awakening (though I didn’t know it at the\ntime), I would even carry inquiry off into sleep. I would try to stay with the query even as my\nconsciousness seemed to disappear into nothingness. I would then pick it up just as soon as I\nremembered upon waking. There’s no need to judge yourself if you can’t stay with it constantly, but as\n148\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nyour passion to penetrate the barrier of illusion grows, you will find that it can be carried with you a lot of\nthe time. After all, if you’ve come this far you’ve realized there is nothing more important than this right?”\n“https://diamondsutrazen.blogspot.com/2019/05/a-fan-in-winter-straw-dog.html\nA Fan in Winter, A Straw Dog\n\"La nuit est profonde, les nuages évanouis, le ciel est pur.\nDans le monde entier, il n'y a pas une poussière pour gêner ma vision.\"\nLike training, satori must be true. If one holds that there is something to practice and realize, one is a\nfollower of the false religion of entity based on affirmation. If, on the other hand, one asserts that there is\nnothing to practice or realize, one is still not above the four types of differentiation and the one hundred\nforms of negation: one is an adherent of the equally false religion of nothingness, founded on negation.\nAnd this is the shadowy product of the dichotomous intellect, holding no truth.\nFirst of all, I ask you to look upon the world's riches as a dunghill, upon the most beautiful men and\nwomen as stinking corpses, upon the highest honors and reputation as an echo, upon the most malicious\ncalumny as the cawing of a crow. Regard yourself as a fan in winter, the universe as a straw dog.\nThis accomplished, train wholeheartedly. Then, and then only, will you awaken. If you dare claim to have\nundergone real training and attained enlightenment without having gone through all this, you are nothing\nbut a liar and are bound for hell. Bear all I have said in mind -- practice truly.\nIf you desire the attainment of satori, ask yourself this question: Who hears sound? As described in the\nSurangamasamadhi, that is Avalokitesvara's faith in the hearer. Since there is such a hearer in you, all of\nyou hear sounds. You may say that it is the ear that hears, yet the ear is but a mechanism. If it could hear\nby itself, then the dead could hear our prayers for them. Inside you, then, is a hearer.\n149\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nNow, this is the way to apply yourself: whether or not you hear anything, keep asking who the hearer is.\nDoubt, scrutinize, paying no attention to fancies or ideas. Strain every nerve without expecting anything\nto happen, without willing satori. Doubt, doubt, doubt. If even one idea arises, your doubt is not\nsufficiently strong, and you must question yourself more intensely. Scrutinize the hearer in yourself, who\nis beyond your power or vision.\nMaster Bassui says, \"When at wits' end and unable to think another thought, you are applying yourself\nproperly.\" Thus do not look around, but devote yourself utterly to doubting self-examination until you\nforget where you are or even that you live. This may lead you to feel completely at sea. Yet you must\npersist in the search for the hearer, sweating, like a dead man, until you are unconscious, a lump of great\ndoubt. But look! That lump will suddenly break up and out of it will leap the angel of the awakening, the\ngreat satori consciousness. It is as if one awoke from the deepest dream, literally returned to life.\nIn Zen practice a variety of supernatural phenomena may be experienced. For example, you may see\nghostly faces, demons, Buddhas, flowers, or you may feel your body becoming like that of a woman, or\neven purified into a state of non-existence. If this happens, your \"doubt in practice\" is still inadequate, for\nif in perfect doubt you will not have such illusions. Indeed it is only when you are not alert that you meet\nwith them. Do not shrink from them, nor prize them. Just doubt and examine yourself all the more\nthoroughly.\nZen practitioners must accept the fact that while in meditation they are likely to suffer one or more of the\nthree maladies: kon, san, and chin. Kon is sleepiness and san instability, both of which are too well known\nfor comment. Chin, on the other hand, is a grave malady and always leads to unhappy results. It is a state\nin which one is free from sleepiness and instability, and all mentalization ceases. One feels gay,\nimmaculate; one can go on in zazen for hours on end. One has a feeling that all things are equal, neither\nexistent nor non-existent, right nor wrong. Those possessed by chin regard it as satori — a most\ndangerous delusion. If you were to remain in this state, you would go far astray. At such times, in fact, you\nmust have the greatest doubt.\n-Zen Master Manzan Dohaku”\n“Nov 16 2017\nDiscourses of Master Po Shan\nPo Shan (1575-1630)\nWhen working at Zen, the important thing is to generate the i ching (doubt sensation). What is this doubt\nsensation? For instance: Where did I come from before my birth, and where shall I go after my death?\n150\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSince one does not know the answer to either question, a strong feeling of \"doubt\" arises in the mind.\nStick this \"doubt-mass\" on to your forehead and keep it there all the time until you can neither drive it\naway nor put it down, even if you want to. Then suddenly you will discover that the doubt-mass has been\ncrushed, that you have broken it into pieces. The masters of old said:\n\"The greater the doubt, the greater the awakening;\nThe smaller the doubt, the smaller the awakening;\nNo doubt, no awakening\"\nWhen working at Zen, the worst thing is to become attached to quietness, because this will unknowingly\ncause you to be engrossed in dead stillness. Then you will develop an inordinate fondness for quietness\nand at the same time an aversion for activity of any kind.\nOnce those who have lived amidst the noise and restlessness of worldly affairs experience the joy of\nquietness, they become captivated by its honey sweet taste, craving it like an exhausted traveler who\nseeks a peaceful den in which to slumber. How can people with such an attitude retain their awareness?\nWhen working at Zen, one does not see the sky when lifting, nor the earth when lowering, one's head. A\nmountain is not a mountain, and water is not water. While walking or sitting one is not aware of doing so.\nThough among a hundred thousand people, no one is seen. Without and within the body and mind\nnothing exists but the burden of this doubt-sensation. This feeling can be described as \"turning the whole\nworld into a muddy vortex.\"\nA Zen yogi should resolutely vow that he will never stop working until this doubt-mass is broken up. This\nis a most crucial point.\nWhat does this \"turning the whole world into a muddy vortex\" mean? It refers to the great Truth, which\nfrom the time of no-beginning has existed latent and idle—it has never been brought forth. Therefore a\nZen yogi should bestir himself to make the heavens spin and the earth and its waters roll; he will benefit\ngreatly from the rolling surges and the tossing waves.\nWhen working at Zen, one should not worry about not being able to revive after death; what should worry\nyou is whether you can die out from the state of life! If you can really wrap yourself up tightly in i ching,\nthe realm of movement will be vanquished naturally without making any specific effort to vanquish it, and\ndistracted thoughts will be purified spontaneously without effort to purify them.\nIn a wholly natural way one will feel the six senses become spacious and vacuous. When one reaches this\nstate, one will awaken to a mere touch and respond to the slightest call. Why then should one worry\nabout not being able to revive?\nWhen working in Zen, one should concentrate on one koan only, and not try to understand or explain\nthem at all. Even if one were able to do so, this would be merely intellectual understanding and not true\nrevelation. The Lotus Sutra says:\n\"This Dharma is not understood through thinking and intellection.\"\n151\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe Total Enlightenment Sutra declares:\n\"To perceive the Realm of Enlightenment of the Tathagata with the thinking mind is like attempting to\nburn Mount Sumeru with the light of a firefly; never will one succeed.\"\nWhen working at Zen, one who works with absorption will feel as if they had lifted a thousand-pound\nload; and even if one wants to put it down, is unable to do so.\nIn ancient times people could enter the Dhyana while tilling the land, picking peaches or doing anything. It\nwas never a matter of sitting idly for prolonged periods, engaged in forcefully suppressing one's thoughts.\nDoes Dhyana mean stopping one's thoughts? If so, this is a debased Dhyana, not the Dhyana of Zen.\nWhen working at Zen, the most harmful thing is to rationalize, conceptualize, or intellectualize the Tao\nwith one's mind. One who does so will never reach Tao.\nWhen working at Zen, one knows not whether they are walking or sitting. Nothing is present in the mind\nbut the hua tou. Before breaking through the doubt-mass, one loses all sensation of body or mind, let\nalone such states as walking or sitting.\nWhen working at Zen, one should not just await the coming of enlightenment with an expectant mind.\nThis is like a traveler who sits idly by the road and expects his home to come to him. One will never arrive\nhome this way. One must walk to get there. Likewise, when working at Zen, one never reaches\nenlightenment merely by waiting for it. One must press forward with all one's mind to get this\nenlightenment.\nAttainment of the great enlightenment is like the sudden blossoming of the lotus flower or the sudden\nawakening of a dreamer. One cannot by waiting awaken from a dream, but one does so automatically\nwhen the time for sleep is over. Flowers cannot bloom by waiting but blossom of themselves when the\ntime has come.\nLikewise enlightenment is not so attained, but comes on its own when conditions are ripe. In other words,\none should exert all one's strength to penetrate into the hua tou, pressing one's mind to the utmost in\norder to achieve realization.\nDo not misunderstand what I have said and just wait for awakening to come. In the moment of\nawakening, the clouds vanish and the clear sky shines vast and empty; nothing can obscure it. In this\nmoment heaven spins and the earth somersaults. An entirely different realm appears.\nThe masters of old said: \"Tao, like the great Void, is all-inclusive. It lacks nothing and nothing remains in\nit.\"\nOne who has really attained the state of flexible hollowness sees no world without and no body or mind\nwithin. Only then can one be considered as having drawn near the entrance of Tao.\nWhen working at Zen, one should know these four important points: To work on it with absolute\ndetachment and complete freedom in a painstaking, direct, continuous, and flexible-hollow way.\n152\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWithout directness exertion is completely wasted; and without exertion, directness is useless because it\nalone can never bring one to the entrance of Tao. Once the entrance is reached, however, one should\nmaintain an uninterrupted continuity in order to attain a state conforming with enlightenment.. Once this\nstate is achieved, one should strive to be flexible-hollow. Only then can one reach the state of wonder.\nPo Shan (1575-1630)\nNotes from the translator for this reading:\n1. I ching is a very important Zen term meaning doubt-sensation or the feeling of doubt. The whole\nsystem of koan exercises is based upon the generation and then the break through of this \"doubt-\nsensation.\" \"Doubt\" as used here, is not doubt in the ordinary sense of the word; it is, rather, a special\ntype of doubt- a doubt without content-or, more succinctly, the pure sensation of doubt.\nSometimes Zen Buddhists also use the term \"doubt-mass\" to denote that this sensation is like a great\nmass or load weighing upon one's mind.\nThough i ching in it original useage denotes the doubt brought about by koan exercise, Master Po Shan\nseems to have used it here in a much wider sense.\n2.The six senses are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.\n3. Hua tou (the essence of the sentence) Although both koan and hua tou may be used to denote the\n\"inquiry exercise of Zen,\" the latter is original and more accurate. \"Koan\" implies the entire Zen story,\nincluding all the events, plus the main question at issue, and therefore is a general term, while \"hua tou\"\nis very specific. Hua tou denotes only the question, not the whole story, and in most cases only the gist,\nhighlight, or essence, so to speak, of the question is implied. Hua tou also means before a word or\nthought and the ends or edges of a sentence.\nSource:\nThe Practice of Zen\nBy: Chang Chen-Chi 1960\nElana\nAs sometimes happens in seeking the journal, what starts out as a fine piece causes some sense of pause\ngiving rise to \"hummm, something's missing here.\" And sometimes an earlier translator seems to have a\nmore balanced presentation of the original teacher's heart/mind. And sometimes entire sections are\nomitted!\nAt any rate, here we have a reading that encourages us to raise this doubt mass. This term alone causes\none to wonder what is this \"doubt\" they are talking about? Even exploring \"what is it?\" as a starting point\nis not a bad place to begin. All too often we think we understand a concept, but upon delving deeper we\nsee ours is a superficial understanding at best.\n153\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nClassical koan practice consisted of a teacher giving a historical koan to a student to work on. While these\nencounters from the past represent powerful break-throughs, they happened spontaneously, on the spot\nbetween a teacher capturing a moment to engender awakening. I have often wondered what someone\nelse's koan could possibly do for later generations. And yet it is a part of Rinzai Zen that is still presently\npracticed.\nEven if you don't have a teacher to give you a koan to \"work on,\" life and our own questioning provide\nvery potent material that causes us to stop and wonder. It enters koan quality when there is no easy\nanswer to your question and you sit with it for years and years. Because it is so personal, it can haunt you\nand return as your spiritul theme.\nJust because there is no easy answer or quick solution, though, is no reason to abandon your efforts or to\ntrivialize your question. Your own questions have the most power if you can allow them to stay close. For\neach of us there is a burning question/ koan that is our own to lead us to enlightenment. Our biggest\nstumbling block is our tendency to fool ourselves and think we know more than we really do....we stop\nand congratulate ourselves too early in the process.\nMay our minds be clear!\nElana” - https://www.dailyzen.com/journal/discourses-of-master-po-shan\n“Awakening the extremely intense desire for Freedom is the most important key in the book you are now\nreading… ...The extremely intense desire for the direct experience of the absolute Truth… ...The extremely\nintense desire to experience who or what you really are at your core and to live eternally as your true\nSelf… ...When you drop all unnecessary activities every day and use all of the free time thus created to\nactually practice every day the most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss, you will know the extremely\nintense desire for Freedom has been awakened… ...If you turn your attention away from thought and\ntowards awareness watching awareness and sustain that look for many hours every day, eventually the\nego dream will end and the true Self will be experienced. Then all suffering ends and what remains is the\neternal perfection of awareness-love-bliss.” - Michael Langford, The Direct Means to Eternal Bliss\n“ANNAMALAI SWAMI – FINAL TALKS\nAnnamalai Swami: Self-inquiry must be done continuously. It doesn't work if you regard it as a part-time\nactivity. You may be doing something that doesn't hold your interest or attention, so you think, ‘I will do\nsome self-inquiry instead'. This is never going to work. You may go two steps forward when you practice,\nbut you go five steps backward when you stop your practice and go back to your worldly affairs. You must\nhave a lifelong commitment to establish yourself in the Self. Your determination to succeed must be\nstrong and firm, and it should manifest as continuous, not part-time, effort.\nFor many lifetimes you have been immersed in ignorance. You are habituated to it. All your deeply rooted\nbeliefs, all your patterns of behavior reinforce ignorance and strengthen the hold it has over you.\nThis ignorance is so strong, so deeply enmeshed in all your psychological structures, it takes a massive\neffort over a long period of time to break free from it. The habits and beliefs that sustain it have to be\nchallenged again and again.\n154\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIgnorance is ignorance of the Self, and to remove it Self-awareness is required. When you come to an\nawareness of the Self, ignorance vanishes. If you don't lose contact with the Self, ignorance can never\narise.\nIf there is darkness, you remove it by bringing light. Darkness is not something real and substantial that\nyou have to dig out and throw away. It is just an absence of light, nothing more. When light is let into a\ndark room, the darkness is suddenly no longer there. It did not vanish gradually or go away piece by\npiece; it simply ceased to exist when the room became filled with light.\nThis is just an analogy because the Self is not like other lights. It is not an object that you either see or\ndon't see. It is there all the time shining as your own reality. If you refuse to acknowledge its existence, if\nyou refuse to believe that it is there, you put yourself in imaginary darkness. It is not a real darkness. It is\njust your own willful refusal to acknowledge that you are light itself. This self-inflicted ignorance is the\ndarkness that has to be banished by the light of the Self within until we become one with it.\np. 18\n……\nATMA SWARUPA\nThe Heart, the birthplace of the ego, is the ground for the appearance, sustenance, and subsidence of the\nentire moving and unmoving universe. It (the Heart) therefore does not become a form in the way the\nignorant believe. It is indeed the transcendental firmament (Paramakasa), the shining of pure being that\nis complete and full.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 257\nThe mind that has died in one’s Heart, the ocean of jnana-swarupa, is eternal silence [mauna]. The\ntranscendental expanse, the true Heart, the rapturous sea of bliss supreme, is one’s true ‘I’ [aham], which\nis replete with love.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 258\nThe Heart alone, true bliss, which exists and shines without thinking any thought, is ‘Annamalai, my Self’.\nIt is impossible for you to measure with your mind that which abides as the unbroken absolute fullness,\nwhich has nothing else existing apart from it.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 259\n257. Heart, the Source, is the beginning, the middle, and the end of all. Heart, the Supreme Space, is never\na form, It is the Light of Truth.\n258. The death of the mind drowned in the Ocean of Self-Consciousness is the eternal Silence. The real ‘I’\nis the Supreme Heart-Space which is the great Ocean of Bliss.\n259. You [the mind] cannot cognize Self, which is the perfect unbroken Existence and the One without a\nsecond. The Heart, Sat-Chit-Ananda, which is the same thought-free Self, is Annamalai.\n155\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSince, through the inquiry ‘Who am I?’ the ego is destroyed in those who have known and reached the\nHeart that is the source of the rising ego, the dualistic pairs of opposing thoughts that exist depending on\nthe ego, which together comprise the notion of bondage, are also totally destroyed. [Within such people]\nthe darkness of ignorance that was the basis of the ego is also annihilated and they become the swarupa,\nthe Supreme Self, the Heart that is eternally free of defilement. As they have attained the surging of the\ntrue and supreme bliss within themselves, at that very moment they are freed from the sorrow of birth.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 260\nMuruganar: As the Heart is the Supreme, and as those who reach it become it, it has been said, ‘Those\nwho have known and reached the Heart…become the swarupa, the Supreme Self’.\n‘The dualistic pairs of opposing thoughts’ refers to vikshepa [the restlessness of the mind and the\nmultiplicity it produces].\nThe collection of ancient vasanas that resides in the Heart orifice as the source of vikshepa is referred to\nas ‘the notion of bondage’. Since vasanas themselves evolve as thoughts, the notion of bondage is\nequated with the dualistic pairs of opposing thoughts.\nWhen one has experienced the cutting of the Heart-knot, one knows and reaches the Heart. As Ulladu\nNarpadu Anubhandham, verse 19, declares, the darkness of avidya [ignorance] and the collection of\nvasanas remain in the orifice of the Heart. As soon as the knot is cut, the Heart that remained in the\norifice of the Heart. As soon as the knot is cut, the Heart that remained closed like a lotus bud, blossoms,\nannihilating vasanas and avidya completely, and shines as the light of being, the exalted expanse. This is\nthe state of absolute liberation.\nBecause it shines, without diminution, as supreme bliss, it has been said, ‘They have attained the surging\nof the true and supreme bliss within themselves.’\nBecause there is no room in that place for the sorrow of birth that arises through ignorance, it has been\nsaid, ‘They are freed from the sorrow of birth’.\nDualistic pairs of opposing thoughts refer to joy and misery, darkness and light, and so on. They arise in\none’s mind through the ancient collection of vasanas and are the cause of one’s sorrow. If the vasanas die\nand the pairs of thoughts cease, then misery also ceases. What exists then is the ocean of bliss. It has\ntherefore been said that those who are freed from the thought-pairs experience the surging of supreme\nbliss.\nWhile that [Heart] abides, pervading both within and without, it exists neither within nor without. The\nbody that appears as the source for the distinction of ‘within and without’ is itself a concept of the\nthinking mind.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 261\nAlthough the body exists in the Self, the ignorant man, who is bound by anava [ego] thinks that the Self\nexists within the body. This is like someone who believes that the screen, the abiding fundamental\nsubstratum, is present within one of the many shadowy picture-[people] who appear on the screen.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 262\n156\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nBhagavan : The body exists within the Self, but he who thinks he exists inside the insentient body is like\nsomeone who regards the screen, the base for the [projected] pictures, as being within one of those\npictures.\nMuruganar: Believing that the base for all the other [cinema] pictures is within one of the pictures is an\nerroneous perspective. Similarly, through ajnana, a person thinks he is within the body, whereas his body\nis actually in the Self, like any other perceived object.\nTherefore, only those mighty ones [jnanis] who have experienced the complete annihilation of the ego\nthat assumes the form of the body will attain eminence, having known its [the Heart’s] omnipresence\nthrough a subtle intelligence [buddhi] whose veiling has been completely cleared.\nGuru Vachaka Kovai v. 263\n- Quotes taken from Ramana Hridayam | Facebook“\n“BASSUI’S FIRST LETTER TO THE ZEN PRIEST IGUCHI\nI have read your presentations at length, but it misses the point of the koan. The Sixth Patriarch said: 'The\nflag doesn't move, the wind doesn't move, only your mind moves.' To realize this clearly is to perceive that\nthe universe and yourself are of the same root, that you and every single thing are a unity. The gurgle of\nthe stream and the sigh of the wind are the voices of the master. The green of pine, the white of snow,\nthese are the colors of the master, the very one who lifts the hands, moves the legs, sees, hears. One who\ngrasps this directly without recourse to reason or intellection can be said to have some degree of inner\nrealization- But this is not yet full enlightenment.\nAn ancient Zen master [Rinzai] said: \"You should not cling to the idea that you are Pure-essence.\" And\nagain: \"Your physical body, composed of the four basic elements, can't hear or understand this preaching.\nThe empty-space can't understand this preaching. Then what is it that hears and understands?\" Meditate\nfully and directly on these words. Take hold of this koan as though wielding the jewel-sword of the Vajra\nking. Cut down whatever appears in the mind.\nWhen thoughts of mundane matters arise, cut them off. When notions of Buddhism arise, likewise lop\nthem off. In short, destroy all ideas, whether of realization, of Buddhas, or of devils, and all day long\npursue the question \"What is it that hears this preaching?\"\nWhen you have eradicated every conception until only emptiness remains, and then cut through even the\nemptiness, your mind will burst open and that which hears will manifest itself. Persevere, persevere-\nnever quit halfway-until you reach the point where you feel as though you have risen from the dead. Only\nthen will you be able to wholly resolve the momentous question \"What is it that hears this preaching?\"\nI am afraid it may be inconvenient for you to write me often, so I am writing you this [kind of detailed]\nletter. After you have read it drop it into the fire.\n- Bassui Tokusho in 'The Three Pillars of Zen'”\nBASSUI’S SECOND LETTER TO THE ZEN PRIEST IGUCHI\n157\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nI have read your letter carefully. Having long admired you for your determination to come to Self-\nrealization. I was highly gratified to learn that you have not forgotten the great question. Your answer has\nbeen noted in all respects.\nHere I want to tell you to make this your koan: ''What is the substance of my fundamental nature?\" In\nyour search for the master that hears and speaks, though thousands of thoughts arise don't entertain\nthem but only ask \"What is it?\" Every thought and all self-awareness will then disappear, followed by a\nstate, not unlike a cloudless sky.\nNow, mind itself has no form. What is it, then, that hears and works and moves about? Delve into yourself\ndeeper and deeper until you are no longer aware of a single object. Then beyond a shadow of a doubt,\nyou will perceive your True-nature, like a man awakening from a dream. Assuredly at that moment,\nflowers will bloom on withered trees, and fire flame up from ice. All of Buddhism, all worldly concern, all\nnotion of good and evil, will have disappeared like last night's dream, and your fundamental Buddha-\nnature alone will manifest itself.\nHaving come to such an inner understanding, you must not then cherish the notion that this Mind is\nfundamentally Buddha-nature. If you do you will be creating for yourself another thought-form.\nOnly because I regard your desire for Self-realization so highly do I write in such detail. Thank you for\nsending the five hundred packets of caked rice and the pound of tea.\n- The Three Pillars of Zen\nBASSUI’S LETTER TO LORD NAKAMURA - GOVERNOR OF AKI PROVINCE\nYou ask me how to practice Zen with reference to this phrase from a sutra: \"Mind, having no fixed abode,\nshould flow forth.\" There is no express method for attaining enlightenment. If you but look into your Self-\nnature directly, not allowing yourself to be deflected, the Mind flower will come into bloom. Hence the\nsutra says: \"Mind, having no fixed abode, should flow forth.\" Thousands of words spoken directly by\nBuddhas and Patriarchs add up to this one phrase. Mind is the True-nature of things, transcending all\nforms. The True-nature is the Way. The Way is Buddha. Buddha is Mind. Mind is not within or without or\nin between. It is not being or nothingness or non-being or non-nothingness or Buddha or mind or matter.\nSo it is called the abodeless Mind. This Mind sees colors with the eyes, hears sounds with the ears. Look\nfor this master directly!\nA Zen master [Rinzai] of old says: \"One's body, composed of the four primal elements can't hear or\nunderstand this preaching. The spleen or stomach or liver or gall bladder can't hear or understand this\npreaching. Empty-space can't understand it. Then what does hear and understand?\" Strive to perceive\ndirectly. If your mind remains attached to any form or feeling whatsoever, or is affected by logical\nreasoning or conceptual thinking, you are as far from true realization as heaven is from earth.\nHow can you cut off at a stroke the sufferings of birth-and-death? As soon as you consider how to\nadvance, you get lost in reasoning; but if you quit you are adverse to the highest path. To be able neither\nto advance nor to quit is to be a \"breathing corpse.\" If in spite of this dilemma you empty your mind of all\nthoughts and push on with your zazen, you are bound to enlighten yourself and apprehend the phrase\n158\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n\"Mind, having no fixed abode, should flow forth.\" Instantly you will grasp the sense of all Zen dialogue a\nwell the profound and subtle meaning of the countless sutras.\nThe layman Ho asked Baso: \"What is it that transcends everything in the universe?\" Baso answered: ' I will\ntell you after you have drunk up the waters of the West River in one gulp.' Ho instantly became deeply\nenlightened. See here, what does this mean? Does it explain the phrase \"Mind, having no fixed abode,\nshould flow forth,\" or does it point to the very one reading this? If you still don't comprehend, go back to\nquestioning, \"What is hearing now?\" Find out this very moment! The problem of birth-and-death is\nmomentous, and the world moves fast. Make the most of time, for it waits for no one.\nYour own Mind is intrinsically Buddha. Buddhas are those who have realized this. Those who haven't are\nthe so-called ordinary sentiant beings. Sleeping and working, standing and sitting, ask yourself \"What is\nmy own Mind?\" looking into the source from which your thoughts arise. What is this subject that right\nnow perceives, thinks, moves, works, goes forth, or returns? To know it you must intensely absorb\nyourself in the question. But even though you do not realize it in this life, beyond a doubt you will in the\nnext because of your present efforts.\nIn your zazen think in terms of neither good nor evil. Don't try to stop thoughts from arising, only ask\nyourself; 'What is my own Mind?\" Now, even when your questioning goes deeper and deeper you will get\nno answer until finally you will reach a cul-de-sac, your thinking totally checked. You won't find anything\nwithin that can be called \"I\" or \"Mind.\" But who is it that understands all this? Continue to probe more\ndeeply yet and the mind that perceives there is nothing will vanish; you will no longer be aware of\nquestioning but only of emptiness. When awareness of even emptiness disappears, you will realise there\nis no Buddha outside Mind and no Mind outside Buddha. Now for the first time you will discover that\nwhen you do not hear with your ears you are truly hearing, and when you do not see with your eyes you\nare really seeing Buddhas of the past, present, and future. But don't cling to any of this, just experience it\nfor yourself!\nSee here, what is your own Mind? Everyone's Original-nature is not less than Buddha. But since men\ndoubt this and search for Buddha and Truth outside their Mind, they fail to attain enlightenment, being\nhelplessly driven within cycles of birth-and-death, entangled in karma both good and bad. The source of\nall karma bondage is delusion i.e. the thoughts, feelings, and perceptions (stemming from ignorance). Rid\nyourself of them and you are emancipated. Just as ash covering a charcoal fire is dispersed when the fire\nis fanned, so these delusions vanish once you realize your Self-nature.\nDuring zazen neither loathe nor be charmed by any of your thoughts. With your mind turned inward, look\nsteadily into their source and the delusive feelings and perceptions in which they are rooted will\nevaporate. This is not yet Self realization, however, even though your mind becomes bright and empty\nlike the sky, you have awareness of neither inner nor outer, and all the ten quarters seem clear and\nluminous. To take this for realization is to mistake a mirage for reality. Now even more intensely search\nthis mind of yours which hears. Your physical body, composed of the four basic elements, is like a\nphantom, without reality, yet apart from this body there is no mind. The empty-space of ten quarters can\nneither see nor hear; still, something within you does hear and distinguish sounds,\nWho or what is it?\n159\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWhen this question totally ignites you, distinctions of good and evil, awareness of being or emptiness,\nvanish like a light extinguished on a dark night. Though you are no longer consciously aware of yourself,\nstill you can hear and know you exist. Try as you will to discover the subject hearing, your efforts will fail\nand you will find yourself at an impasse. All at once your mind will burst into great enlightenment and you\nwill feel as though you have risen from the dead, laughing loudly and clapping your hands in delight. Now\nfor the first time you will know that Mind itself is Buddha.\nWere someone to ask, \"What does one's Buddha-mind look like?' I would answer: \"In the tree fish play, in\nthe deep sea bird are flying.\" What does this mean? If you don't understand it, look into your own Mind\nand ask yourself: \"What is he, this master who sees and hears?\"\nMake the most of time: it waits for no one!\n- The Three Pillars of Zen\n“c. Venerable Ones, get to know the one who plays with these configurations. He is the original source of\nall the Buddhas. Knowing him, wherever you are is home. Your physical body, formed by the four\nelements, cannot understand the Dharma you are listening to; nor can your spleen, stomach, liver or gall;\nnor can the empty space.\nWho then can understand the Dharma and can listen to it? The one here before your very eyes, brilliantly\nclear and shining without any form — there he is who can understand the Dharma you are listening to.\nIf you can really grasp this, you are not different from the Buddhas and patriarchs. Ceaselessly he is right\nhere, conspicuously present.28”\n- Ch’an Master Linji (Zen Master Rinzai)\n“Inquiry: “Who?”\nWhen in the introduction we examined what is meant by the word kensho, I said that deep inquiry into\nthe nature of one’s own existence is itself an important method of Zen practice. “What is the nature of\nthis mind that experiences?” “Who is it that carries this body around?” “Who or what am I?” These are\nexpressions of fundamental and essential human questions, not at all limited to Zen.\nCertainly, inquiring into these questions in any manner is a worthy undertaking. But it should be made\nclear that such inquiry becomes Zen practice only when it is done in the yogic manner encompassing\none’s whole body-mind. Unifying the body, mind, breath, and subtle energetic system, and making use of\nconcentrated samadhi power to then enter with one’s entire being into these questions—becoming one\nwith them and so penetrating them to their core—is the only way we could be justified in calling our\ninquiry Zen practice.\nInquiry done like this in an integrated state, with great energetic effort and commitment, immediately\nconfirms something important: we could never arrive at acceptable answers to our pressing existential\nquestions through intellectual analysis and learned knowledge alone. Nothing that we could read, think,\ncontemplate, or conceive will lead us by itself to a truly satisfying resolution. Only answers that explode\n160\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nforth from the deepest totality of one’s integrated being can satisfy and liberate. Whatever outward forms\nour path of Zen practice may take, the essential inner point of all practice is like this. Here we may indeed\nglimpse the footsteps of all the great masters before us, regardless of tradition.\nNaturally, Zen preserves many explicit instructions for accomplishing this that we may receive from a\nqualified teacher. In part two we will revisit this kind of practice, exploring how the methods of internal\nenergetic cultivation inform such an embodied way of working with wato and koan.\nBut with all that said, I think it not harmful for beginners to take up a general practice of inquiry. In its\nessence, such inquiry is really another way of turning around the light of our awareness such that we\nfixate less on perceived objects and instead begin to see at the source of seeing, hear at the source of\nhearing, and trace back thoughts to the source of thinking. For our purposes here I will thus give simple\ninstructions that could be sufficient for beginners to temporarily use on their own, until they are able to\nfind a teacher.\n1. The essential point of this method is to release one’s usual rigid fixation on outer circumstances and\njust look with great energy into the source of all one’s experiences. This is to be done within whatever\nactivity one is doing. When you eat, for example, focus completely on the act of eating, bringing your\nattention to the sensations and tastes, attending to them with your whole body-mind. But as you do this,\ngive rise to a simple thought—or more accurately, a feeling—of inquiry: Who is eating? Who or what is it\nthat is experiencing this? Who is tasting the food?\n2. When you are walking about, spread your vision out and attend to the act of walking. Inhabit it with\nyour whole body-mind and enter the samadhi of that activity. While doing so, give rise to the simple\ninquiry again and again with great energy: Who is walking?\n3. All activities are like this. As you throw yourself into your daily work, sparing nothing of your attention\nand fully engaging your entire body and senses to completely “taste” the situations you encounter,\ninquire constantly in the background and observe with a feeling of wishing fervently to know: Who is\ndoing this? Who (or what) is it? What is this?\n4. In the beginning you will find that you often forget to set up this mind of inquiry. It is easy to be taken\nup by the wonderful taste of the food, the sights that meet the eye (or the thoughts that arise) while\nwalking, the stressful situations of work, and so on. But just keep reminding yourself to observe and ask:\nWho is this? Who am I? What is this thing that is experiencing, seeing, hearing, eating, working, shitting,\nsleeping, growing old? If you like, you could even hang up the single word “Who?” or the words “What is\nthis?” someplace like your desk at work. Seeing them repeatedly, you may be reminded to look closely at\nyour life while engaged within the midst of it.\nIf you practice inquiring into your daily affairs like this, you may begin from time to time to have a strange\nfeeling. It is something like glancing at a word on a page or at one’s own outstretched hand: normally a\nfeeling of familiar recognition arises. But if we look intently at one of these things long enough, our\nhabitual recognition—that is, the conceptual fabrication we make and project onto the sight of these\nthings—falls somewhat away. A word then suddenly looks odd and foreign, a collection of lines and\nshapes rather than something with meaning. A hand suddenly looks strange and unrecognizable, as\nwondrous and odd as the appendage of any alien creature in a science fiction movie. Practicing inquiry of\n161\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nthe kind I have described, we will start to have moments when our whole existence and being suddenly\nseem foreign, unrecognizable, and alien in such a way. We will realize that we really have no idea at all\nwhat this strange existence is, and we actually haven’t the slightest clue who or what this one who\nexperiences, lives, and dies actually is.\nIn such a way we can enter the “great doubt”* often spoken of in Zen. And it is crucial to do so, because it\nis just this fundamental, pressing, existential inquiry that will drive our Zen practice most quickly to\nfruition. Stepping out from the illusory, projected world of fantasy within which most people unknowingly\nlive, we must come to see clearly that there is nothing we know for certain at all. It is an odd but quite\ngood place at which to arrive, this state of utter nonknowing. It is a state pregnant with the possibility of\nwisdom.\nTo sum up this method most simply, the following words from Torei Enji—the great master who helped\nrefine the koan method of practice used in Rinzai Zen today—are incredibly useful. Taking Torei at his\nword, putting these simple instructions into practice and engaging the entire body-mind as best we can,\nthere is no doubt that we will draw closer to the gate of kensho.\nLook at what is, at who sees, hears, walks, sits—now, here! With all your heart, look at everything. Without\ngiving rise in the heart to [concepts of] being and not being, to yes and no, without discrimination and\nwithout reasoning, just look! When the time is ripe, it will appear of itself, requiring neither knowledge nor\ndiscrimination.24”\n- Excerpt from Meido Moore’s Hidden Zen book (chapter 2)\nZen Master Dogen:\nhttp://www.oceanmoon.org/zen.html\nConsider the Buddha: although he was wise at birth, the traces of his six years of upright sittingcan yet be seen.\nAs for Bodhidharma, although he had received the mind-seal, his nine years of facing a wall is celebrated still. If\neven the ancient sages were like this, how can we today dispense with wholehearted practice?\nTherefore, put aside the intellectual practice of investigating words and chasing phrases, and learn to take the\nbackward step that turns the light and shines it inward. Body and mind of themselves will drop away, and your\noriginal face will manifest. If you want to realize such, get to work on such right now.\n“21th June 2010\nThank a lot!\nYour self-inquiry instruction is almost like a hint. It is rather hard for low-intelligent people like to comprehend\nand follow. :) RM and Adya also gave out instructions like yours. Could you give a couple of examples and\ndescribe the detailed steps you do self-inquiry from the beginning to the end?\nFor example,\n162\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nHear a bird chirping\nWho hear that?\nIt is me.\nNo.\n.......\nHi,\nSteps are not necessary in self inquiry, because this method is meant to cut through all steps, thought-\ninference-process, conceptualizations, to directly awaken to your True Self. This is why Koan and Zen is\nknown as the method and school of Sudden or Instantaneous Awakening, not gradual or step-by-step\nawakening. This is the Direct Path.\nFor example,\nHear a bird chirping.\nWhat/who is hearing?\n(silence)\nSilence means you aren't trying to answer the question using your mind (because the answer cannot be\nfound there - the more you try to figure out with your mind the more time is wasted because you are\nlooking at the wrong direction), but instead you are directly looking at 'What Hears' and experiencing your\nTrue Self, your Hearing-Nature/Pure Awareness. The inner cognizer (I AM) turns within and cognizes itself,\nits true nature.\nThe pure silence underneath the sound is your true nature, but it is not an inert nothingness, in fact not\neven silence as such, but more accurately a featureless wide-awake space which perceives all sounds, all\nsights, all thoughts, etc. It cannot be understood by the mind. You have to trace the hearing, the radiance,\nthe seeing, to its Source.\nIf you truly and successfully traced all perceptions to its Source, you will realize and experience a\nCertainty of Being, an undeniability of your very Consciousness which is formless and intangible but at\nthe same time a most solid self-evident fact of your being.\nHowever if during the process of self-inquiry a thought arise like \"could this be it, what is Awareness, etc\",\njust ignore the thought, don't attempt to answer them using the mind/logic, but continue turning the light\naround, asking \"Who am I\" or \"Who is aware of the thought?\" and so on. Turn away from all doubts to the\nDoubtless Certainty/Undeniability of Being/Consciousness, and all your doubts and questions are\nresolved in an instant.\nAs Jason Swason said:\n163\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“By turning the attention to the mind, immediately there are doubts. More thoughts rush in to question the\nquestions, confirm or contradict other thoughts. A maddening cycle...\nNotice when thoughts are paused there are no doubts; the certainty of (doubtless) Being is obviously present;\nthe unquestionable FACT of EXISTENCE. Notice that the Being is ALWAYS presently shining, effortlessly and\nspontaneously. Stay with that undeniable non-conceptual confidence. Your Being has always been present for\nevery single experience. That natural cognition in which all experiences arise is not a person.\nBe as you ARE and not what you imagine yourself to be.”\nAnd as Ramana Maharshi instructed:\n“If other thoughts arise, one should, without attempting to complete them, enquire, 'To whom did they occur?'\nWhat does it matter if ever so many thoughts arise? At the very moment that each thought rises, if one vigilantly\nenquires 'To whom did this appear?' it will be known 'To me'. If one then enquires 'Who am I?' the mind will turn\nback to its source and the thought that had arisen will also subside. By repeatedly practising in this way, the\nmind will increasingly acquire the power to abide at its source. When the mind, which is subtle, is externalised\nvia the brain and the sense organs, names and forms, which are material, appear. When it abides in the Heart,\nnames and forms disappear. Keeping the mind in the Heart, not allowing it to go out, is called 'facing the Self' or\n'facing inwards'. Allowing it to go out from the Heart is termed 'facing outwards' When the mind abides in the\nHeart in this way, the 'I', the root of all thoughts, [vanishes]. Having vanished, the ever-existing Self alone will\nshine. The state where not even the slightest trace of the thought 'I' remains is alone swarupa [one's real\nnature]. This alone is called mauna [silence]. Being still in this way can alone be called jnana drishti [seeing\nthrough true knowledge]. Making the mind subside into the Self is 'being still'. On the other hand, knowing the\nthoughts of others, knowing the three times [past present and future] and knowing events in distant places -\nthese can never be jnana drishti.”\nDon't try to comprehend the process intellectually. Don't stop at any thought-conclusion, like \"to me\"\n(which is simply an inferred thought), but trace all thoughts and perceptions to its source by asking \"Who\nam I?\" to discover your True Self. Spending more time trying to figure out how this works in the mind is\njust going to prevent you from directly realizing and experiencing your True Mind. The purpose is to trace\nthe radiance back to the source, then abide at the Source as Ramana Maharshi said. This is what I warned\nyou earlier (as I know you will have such doubts and questions which I myself did earlier on):\nhttp://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/390582?page=4#post_9849278\nNevertheless, the method is indeed important to give rise to realization. Any method that leads to realization\nmust be direct - means it must be a means that makes a practitioner bypass all the mind's conceptualizations\nand inference processes which are all indirect and secondary (which is not a direct realization and experience of\nyour true essence and hence leaves doubts), so that you can touch directly and with certainty the essence of\nyour Being without intermediary. On hindsight there was a period when I first started practicing self-\ninquiry where I was still intellectualizing about this, like how should I practice self inquiry, what\ndoes asking 'Before birth Who am I' mean and leads to, etc, which are all sidetracks and\n164\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ndistractions because it is still using the mind and indirect inference and hence not a 'direct'\napproach to realize the essence of Being.\nSo do beware of intellectualizing these things, because it will not lead to Self-Realization - only the\ndirect approach to investigate and look (a non-conceptual exploration) into the essence of Self\nleads to realization.\nDon't worry about doing it the wrong way, if you keep asking 'Who am I?' and turn the light around to its\nSource instead of intellectualizing it or following the mind, you are certainly on the right path.\nAnyway I don't know if you read this before, you probably did, but anyway here's a good article by Ken\nWilber:\n“There are many things that I can doubt, but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My\nconsciousness IS, and even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doubting. I can imagine that my\nsenses are being presented with a fake reality – say, a completely virtual reality or digital reality, which looks\nreal but is merely a series of extremely realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the consciousness that is\ndoing the watching…\nThe very undeniability of my present awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers to\nme a certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt\nconsciousness and Being in this moment, for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all existing…\nWho am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of\neverything?\nIf you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is actually that which is thinking both of those\nthoughts. So you can doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt the doubter, never\nreally doubt the Witness of the entire display. Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows\nGod or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-\nmind. The certainty lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not in the objects\nthemselves. You will never, never, never see God, because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object\nthat can be seen…\nThis pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never\nreally be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not\nhard to find but impossible to avoid: it is that which is looking at this page right now. Can’t you feel That One?\nWhy on earth do you keep looking for God when God is actually the Looker?\nSimply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?\nI am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am aware of my thoughts, so I am not my\nthoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body – and\nI am none of those because I can Witness them all.\n165\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nMoreover, I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can doubt that objects of thought exist –\nbut I cannot doubt that the Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there to witness\nthe doubt.\nI am not objects in nature, not feelings in the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am\nthat Witness – a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent Openness that impartially notices all that arises,\nas a mirror spontaneously reflects all its objects…\nYou can already feel some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of witnessing this moment, you\nalready feel that you are free from the suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts –\nthey all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open Witness of them all, untouched by their torments\nand tortures.\nThis is actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the formless Witness, causal nothingness, the\nvast Emptiness in which the entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are not the body,\nnot the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that – you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and\nLiberation.\nWith this discovery… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any and all finite objects; you rest as\ninfinite Consciousness. You are free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted, drenched in a\nblissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality\nand suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss, the unqualifiable Ground of all that\nis, and all that was, and all that ever shall be.\nBut why is that only halfway home? Because as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously\naware of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the\nWitness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the\nearth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos\nbecause One Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the palm of your hand;\nsupernovas swirl in your heart and the solar system replaces your head…\nYou are One Taste, the empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly\nvast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…\nSo the primary Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between… in here and out there, subject and\nobject, the empty Witness and all things witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once\nyou actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then – can it be transcended into radical Nonduality,\nand halfway home becomes fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…\nAnd so how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if you\nreally overcome the Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking at\nthe world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of that; you actually feel that you are one with\neverything that is arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face looking out there. “In\n166\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhere” and “out there” have become One Taste with a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels\nlike a five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling hard to miss.\nAt that point, which is actually your ever-present condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular\norganism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction that makes it seem that “you” are in the\nhead looking at the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the personal bodymind:\ninstead, consciousness is one with all that is arising – a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and\ninfinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject and every single object are\nerotically united in the Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and\nyou become the All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity is everything that is arising moment to\nmoment (just as previously you felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal coil of flesh\nyou call a body). Inside and outside have become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!”\n(Source: Boomeritis, Sidebar E: “The Genius Descartes Gets a Postmodern Drubbing: Integral Historiography in a\nPostmodern Age”.

Yet the earnest seeker plods on in spite of all. What can the\ngnani do for such a seeker?\n167\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nM: If the seeker is earnest, the light can be given. The light is for all and always there, but the seekers are\nfew, and among those few, those who are ready are very rare. Ripeness of heart and mind is\nindispensable.\nQ: Did you get your own realisation through effort or by the grace of your Guru?\nM: His was the teaching and mine was the trust. My confidence in him made me accept his words as true,\ngo deep into them, live them, and that is how I came to realise what I am. The Guru’s person and words\nmade me trust him and my trust made them fruitful.\nQ: But can a Guru give realisation without words, without trust, just like this, without any preparation?\nM: Yes, one can, but where is the taker? You see, I was so attuned to my Guru, so completely trusting\nhim, there was so little of resistance in me, that it all happened easily and quickly. But not everybody is so\nfortunate. Laziness and restlessness often stand in the way and until they are seen and removed, the\nprogress is slow. All those who have realised on the spot, by mere touch, look or thought have been ripe\nfor it. But such are very few. The majority needs some time for ripening. Sadhana is accelerated ripening.\nQ: What makes one ripe? What is the ripening factor?\nM: Earnestness of course, one must be really anxious. After all, the realised man is the most earnest\nman. Whatever he does, he does it completely, without limitations and reservations. Integrity will take you\nto reality.\n.............\nQ: In the beginning we may have to pray and meditate for some time before we are ready for self-inquiry.\nM: If you believe so, go on. To me, all delay is a waste of time. You can skip all the preparation and go\ndirectly for the ultimate search within. Of all the Yogas it is the simplest and the shortest.\n.............\nM: The seeker is he who is in search of himself.\nGive up all questions except one: 'Who am I?' After all, the only fact you are sure of is that you are. The 'I\nam' is certain. The 'I am this' is not. Struggle to find out what you are in reality.\nTo know what you are, you must first investigate and know what you are not.\nDiscover all that you are not - body, feelings, thoughts, time, space, this or that - nothing, concrete or\nabstract, which you perceive can be you. The very act of perceiving shows that you are not what you\nperceive.\nThe clearer you understand that on the level of mind you can be described in negative terms only, the\nquicker will you come to the end of your search and realize that you are the limitless being.” - Soh’s E-\nJournal entries in 2010 https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html\nCh’an/Zen master Xu Yun said:\n168\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“There are many hua t’ous, such as: ‘All things are returnable to One, to what is (that) One\nreturnable?’ 1 ‘Before you were born, what was your real face?’2 but the hua t’ou: ‘Who is repeating\nBuddha’s name?’ is widely in use (today).\nWhat is hua t’ou? (lit. word-head). Word is the spoken word and head is that which precedes word.\nFor instance, when one says ‘Amitabha Buddha’, this is a word. Before it is said it is a hua t’ou (or\nante-word). That which is called a hua t’ou is the moment before a thought arises. As soon as a\nthought arises, it becomes a hua wei (lit. word-tail). The moment before a thought arises is called\n‘the un-born’. That void which is neither disturbed nor dull, and neither still nor (one-sided) is called\n‘the unending’. The unremitting turning of the light inwards on oneself, instant after instant, and\nexclusive of all other things, is called ‘looking into the hua t’ou’ or ‘taking care of the hua t’ou’.\nWhen one looks into a hua t’ou, the most important thing is to give rise to a doubt. Doubt is the\ncrutch of hua t’ou.3 For instance, when one is asked: ‘Who is repeating Buddha’s name?’ everybody\nknows that he himself repeats it, but is it repeated by the mouth or by the mind? If the mouth\nrepeats it, why does not it do so when one sleeps? If the mind repeats it, what does the mind look\nlike? As mind is intangible, one is not clear about it. Consequently some slight feeling of doubt\narises about ‘WHO’. This doubt should not be coarse; the finer it is, the better. At all times and in all\nplaces, this doubt alone should be looked into unremittingly, like an ever-flowing stream, without\ngiving rise to a second thought. If this doubt persists, do not try to shake it; if it ceases to exist, one\nshould gently give rise to it again. Beginners will find the hua t’ou more effective in some still place\nthan amidst disturbance. However, one should not give rise to a discriminating mind; one should\nremain indifferent to either the effectiveness or ineffectiveness (of the hua t’ou) and one should\ntake no notice of either stillness or disturbance. Thus, one should work at the training with\nsingleness of mind.\n(In the hua t’ou): ‘Who is repeating the Buddha’s name?’ emphasis should be laid upon the word\n‘Who’, the other words serving only to give a general idea of the whole sentence. For instance (in the\nquestions): ‘Who is wearing this robe and eating rice?’, ‘Who is going to stool and is urinating?’, ‘Who\nis putting an end to ignorance?’, and ‘Who is able to know and feel?’, as soon as one lays emphasis\nupon (the word) ‘Who’, while one is walking or standing, sitting or reclining, one will be able to give\nrise to a doubt without difficulty and without having to use one’s faculty of thought to think and\ndiscriminate. Consequently the word ‘Who’ of the hua t’ou is a wonderful technique in Ch’an\ntraining. However, one should not repeat the word ‘Who’ or the sentence ‘Who is repeating the\nBuddha’s name?’ like (adherents of the Pure Land School) who repeat the Buddha’s name. Neither\nshould one set one’s thinking and discriminating mind on searching for him who repeats the\nBuddha’s name. There are some people who unremittingly repeat the sentence: ‘Who is repeating\nthe Buddha’s name?’; it would be far better merely to repeat Amitabha Buddha’s name (as do\nfollowers of the Pure Land School) for this will give greater merits. There are others who indulge in\nthinking of a lot of things and seek after everything here and there, and call this the rising of a\ndoubt; they do not know that the more they think, the more their false thinking will increase, just\n169\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nlike someone who wants to ascend but is really descending. You should know all this.” -\nhttps://buddhismnow.com/2009/12/22/hua-tou/\n“Our questions become more and more subtle and soon begin to obsess us. Who am I? How do I know who\nI am? These questions go round and round in our minds like tired and angry boxers. Sometimes, we may\nwant to quit thinking about the Hua Tou, but we find we can't get it out of our mind. The bell won't ring and\nlet us rest. If you don't like pugilistic metaphors you could say that the Hua Tou begins to haunt us like a\nmelody that we just can't stop humming.\nSo there we are - always challenged, always sparring. Needless to say, a Hua Tou should never degenerate\ninto an empty expression. Many people think they can shadowbox with their Hua Tou and just go through\nthe motions of engagement. While their minds are elsewhere, their lips say, \"Who is repeating the Buddha's\nname? Who is repeating the Buddha's name? Who is repeating the Buddha's name?\" This is the way of\nfeisty parrots, not of Chan practitioners.\nThe Hua Tou has meaning. It is a question that has an answer and we must be determined to find that\nanswer. I know that \"Who am I?\" sounds like a simple question, one we ought to be able to answer without\ndifficulty. But it is not an easy question to answer. Often it is extremely puzzling.”\n- Ch’an/Zen Master Hsu Yun\nNafis Rahman\nI like these instructions from Lama Surya Das’s book “Natural Radiance”. Very clear and direct imo (found\nit first in the Atr guide):\nOnce your mind is calm, focused, lucid, and clear, abruptly turn the mind on itself—mind the mind and\nturn it inward, with laserlike self-inquiry questions: “Who is thinking my thoughts? Who is trying to\nmeditate? Who is it; what is it; where is it? Who is experiencing my experience right now?”\nThere is no need to analyze too much—just abruptly pop the question and observe what happens. Let go\nand see if you can startle yourself into a new way of seeing and being, short-circuiting your usual\noutward-looking, dualistic thought process of self and other. See through the seer, directly experience the\nexperiencer, and be free; rest in luminous centerless openness, the natural Great Perfection, pure\npresence, rigpa.\nAgain cutting even deeper, abruptly turn the mind upon itself again: Who is experiencing? Who and what\nis hearing? Who and what is seeing, thinking, and feeling? Who is having these physical sensations? Who\nis it; what is it; where is it? Is it in the head; is it in the body; is it in the heart; is it in the mind and\nconsciousness? Who is experiencing? Who or what am I? How is it happening? See if you can enter the\nbottomless gap between thoughts, beneath thoughts. See if you can directly experience whatever is not\nthought—the luminous awareness that exists prethought or beyond or beneath thought, or after all\nthought has ceased. Trace the source of all of your thoughts, feelings, experiences, physical sensations,\nand perceptions. Notice how they arise, and, after they arise, where they are in your present experience\nand where they go. See if you can follow the disillusion point back into the luminous void that is\n170\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ncenterless—the openness that is everything’s ultimate identity, the great Who, the great What that is\nknown as buddha nature. And if you cannot find anything to follow, just rest in that great silence, and be\nnothing for just one instant. Being nothing but pure awareness for an instant would be transformative in\nitself, and more than enough. Emaho!\nWhen the mind starts to move, as it will, and thoughts and feelings and physical sensations again begin to\nproliferate, turn the mind upon itself again instead of looking outward at outer phenomena, projections,\nand perceptions. Turn the searchlight inward and mind the mind, becoming more keenly aware of\nawareness itself. Continue this laserlike questioning of who and what is experiencing, who is thinking,\nwho is hearing, who, what, where, how and then let go and release—drop everything: drop body and\nmind—and sense who or what is present between thoughts and when thought has ceased, even for a\nmoment. If you discover that you really do not know who you are, then that is enough. That is what is true\nfor you in this moment, and that is sufficient truth for now.\nAlso:\nIn order to answer the question “Who am I?”, in order to go back to before the beginning within your own\nexperience, you have to put your attention on the deepest sense of what it feels like to be yourself right\nnow, and simultaneously let everything else go. Letting go means falling so deeply into yourself that all\nthat is left is empty space.\nTo discover that infinite depth in your own self, you must find a way to enter into a deep state of\nmeditation—so deep that your awareness of thought moves into the background and eventually\ndisappears. As your awareness detaches itself from the thought-stream, your identification with emotion\nand memory begins to fall away. When awareness of thought disappears, awareness of the passing of\ntime disappears along with it. If you keep penetrating into the infinite depths of your own self, even your\nawareness of your own physical form will disappear.\nIf you go deep enough, letting your attention expand and release from all objects in consciousness, you\nwill find that all the structures of the created universe begin to crumble before your eyes. Awareness\nitself—limitless, empty, pristine—becomes the only object of your attention.\nAs your attention is released from the conditioned mind-process, freed from the confines of the body and\nthe boundaries of the personal self-sense, the inner dimension of your own experience begins to open up\nto an immeasurable degree. Imagine that you have been fast asleep in a small, dark chamber, then\nsuddenly awaken to find yourself floating in the infinite expanse of a vast, peaceful ocean. That’s what this\njourney to the depths of your own self feels like. You become aware of a limitless dimension that you did\nnot even know was there. Moments before, you may have experienced yourself as being trapped, a\nprisoner of your body, mind, and emotions. But when you awaken to this new dimension, all sense of\nconfinement disappears. You find yourself resting in, and as, boundless empty space.\nIn that empty space, the mind is completely still; there is no time, no memory, not even a trace of\npersonal history. And the deeper you fall into that space, the more everything will continue to fall away,\nuntil finally all that will be left is you. When you let absolutely everything go—body, mind, memory, and\ntime—you will find, miraculously, that you still exist. In fact, in the end, you discover that all that exists is\nyou!”\nFrom: https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary.../dp/1590792092\n171\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAMAZON.COM\nEvolutionary Enlightenment: A New Path to Spiritual Awakening\nEvolutionary Enlightenment: A New Path to Spiritual Awakening\n2\n• ·\nReply\n• · 5h\n• ·\nEdited\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nNafis Rahman\nSecond section from Andrew Cohen, first section from Lama Surya Das?\n• ·\nReply\n• · 3h\n•\nNafis Rahman\nSoh Wei Yu Yes!\nTwo other sections I really liked:\n“The contemplation of consciousness—which is the contemplation of no-thing whatsoever—is endlessly\nfascinating. It’s like staring at a candle in a dark night—you find yourself mesmerized by something that is\nunchanging yet infinitely compelling. You feel drawn into something you don’t understand rationally but\nthat your heart or soul grasps completely. You are drawn into it, and as you are drawn into it, the only\nthing you experience as real is the eternal or timeless nature of Being itself. You find yourself in a state of\nrapture, because the deepest part of yourself has been released from your ego’s endless fears and\nconcerns, and drawn out of the time process altogether.”\n_______________\n172\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“The secret of enlightenment is the absolute, unequivocal conviction that it exists.\nWhat does that mean? It means you have discovered an unshakable confidence in the fact of\nnonduality—in the perennial mystical revelation that IT IS . . . and I AM THAT. A confidence in that which\ncan never be seen or known is the very ground of the enlightened state. Being is ungraspable, it’s\nunknowable, it’s ever elusive, and yet it is the only place you can find true confidence in life. Why?\nBecause it is the very source of life itself.\nThe conscious experience of Being, which is what enlightenment is, has always been the ultimate answer\nto the most fundamental spiritual questions: Who am I? and Why am I here? Those who have tasted\nenlightened awareness find that in that experience, any trace of existential doubt and all the questions\nthat go along with it instantaneously disappear. It’s not even that they are answered, but rather, the\nquestions lose their meaning. When you locate the nonrelative, or absolute, nature of consciousness in\nthe depths of your own self, it is experienced as a clarity that is empty of content; a weightiness that is full\nof nothing in particular; a profound knowing that dissolves all questions. In that questionless state, you\nfind yourself profoundly rooted and radically free, supported by an absolute confidence in the knowing of\nno-thing that changes everything. The experience of that empty ground is the answer—the one answer\nthat always liberates each and every one of us. You simply know, unequivocally, before thought, that I am.\nThat’s the only answer: I AM. There is no why.”\nThe book has a few other sections that are helpful for triggering I AM.\n1\n·\nReply\n· 8m\nSoh’s e-book has a chapter on Self-Inquiry: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-\njournal.html\nAlso read: The Direct Path to Your Real Self - https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-direct-\npath-to-your-real-self.html , A Fan in Winter, A Straw Dog -\nhttp://diamondsutrazen.blogspot.com/2019/05/a-fan-in-winter-straw-dog.html ,\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/01/awakening-to-natural-state-guest.html ,\nhttps://youtu.be/1wMHiPqSYt0 , https://youtu.be/tiIYI2i_CGs\nThe Sixth Ch’an/Zen Patriarch’s Instructions to Hui Ming in the Platform Sutra\nHui Neng said, \"Since you have come for the Dharma, you may put aside all conditions.

If you reply, as most do,\nthat it is Mind or Nature or Buddha or one’s Face before birth or one’s Original Home or Koan or Being or\nNothingness or Emptiness or Form-and-Color or the Known or the Unknown or Truth or Delusion, or say\nsomething or remain silent, or regard it as Enlightenment or Ignorance, you fall into error at once. What is\nmore, if you are so foolhardy as to doubt the reality of this master, you bind yourself though you use no\nrope. However much you try to know it through logical reasoning or to name or call it, you are doomed to\nfailure. And even though all of you becomes one mass of questioning as you turn inward and intently search\nthe very core of your being, you will find nothing that can be termed Mind or Essence. Yet should someone\ncall your name, something from within will hear and respond. Find out this instant who it is!\nIf you push forward with your last ounce of strength at the very point where the path of your thinking has\nbeen blocked, and then, completely stymied, leap with hands high in the air into the tremendous abyss of\nfire confronting you — into the ever-burning flame of your own primordial nature — all ego-consciousness,\nall delusive feelings and thoughts and perceptions will perish with your ego-root and the true source of\nyour Self-nature will appear. You will feel resurrected, all sickness having completely vanished, and will\nexperience genuine peace and joy.” –Bassui\n…\nIf you want to realize your own Mind, you must first of all look into the source from which thoughts flow.\nSleeping and working, standing and sitting, profoundly ask yourself, \"What is my own Mind?\" with an\nintense yearning to resolve this question. This is called \"training\" or \"practice\" or \"desire for truth\" or\n\"thirst for realization.\" What is termed Zazen is no more than looking into one's own mind. It is better to\nsearch your own mind devotedly than to read and recite innumerable sutras and dharani every day for\ncountless years.\n…\n174\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAt work, at rest, never stop trying to realize who it is that hears. Even though your questioning becomes\nalmost unconscious, you won’t find the one who hears, and all your efforts will come to naught.\nYet sounds can be heard, so question yourself to an even profounder level.\nAt last, every vestige of self-awareness will disappear and you will feel like a cloudless sky. Within yourself\nyou will find no “I,” nor will you discover anyone who hears. This Mind is like the void, and yet it hasn’t a single\nspot that can be called empty.\nThis state is OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR Self-realization. (Comments by Soh: mistaking experience for\nrealization, as I explained the difference between experience and realization above)\nCast off what has been realized. Turn back to the subject that realizes, to the root bottom, and resolutely go\non.\nWhat is this mind? Who is hearing these sounds? Your physical being doesn’t hear, nor does the void.\nThen what does?\nKeep asking with all your strength, \"What is it that hears!?\" Only when you have completely exhausted the\nquestioning will the question burst; now you will feel like a man come back from the dead.\nThis is true Realization.\n-- Rinzai Zen master Bassui Tokusho, 1327-87\nRead the whole discourse by Bassui on Self-Enquiry here: https://www.thedaobums.com/topic/12089-\nzen-master-bassuis-one-mind/ . This teaching by Bassui also appears in “Three Pillars of Zen”, a\nrecommended reading.\nExcerpt from Three Pillars of Zen\nExcerpts from recommended reading, Three Pillars of Zen:\n“ROSHI [SHARPLY]: Who are you? [No answer.] Who are you!STUDENT [PAUSING]: I don’t know.ROSHI:\nGood! Do you know what you mean by “I don’t know”?STUDENT: No, I don’t.ROSHI: You are You! You are\nonly You—that is all.STUDENT: What did you mean by “Good!” when I answered “I don’tknow”?ROSHI: In\nthe profoundest sense, we can know nothing.STUDENT: Yesterday when you told me you were going to\nask mewho I am, I concluded that I must have some answer prepared, so Ithought of various responses,\nbut just now when you asked “Who are you?” I couldn’t think of a single thing.ROSHI: Excellent! It shows\nyour mind is emptied of all ideas. Now you can respond with your whole being, not with just your head.\nWhen I said I would ask you who you are, I didn’t want you toreason out an answer but only to penetrate\ndeeper and deeper intoyourself with “Who am I?” When you come to the sudden inner realization of your\nTrue-nature, you will be able to respond instantly without reflection.\n175\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWhat is this [suddenly striking tatami mat with baton]? [No answer] Probe further! Your mind is almost\nripe.\nSTUDENT: I have been asking and asking “Who am I?” until I feel there is just no answer to this question.\nROSHI: You won’t find an entity called “I.” STUDENT [HEATEDLY]: Then why am I asking the question!\nROSHI: Because in your present state you can’t help yourself. The ordinary person is forever asking\n“Why?” or “What?” or “Who?” There are many koans in which monks ask “What is Buddha?” or “Why did\nBodhidharma come from India to China?” The aim of the master’s response is to break open the monk’s\ndeluded mind so that he can realize his question is an abstraction.\nSTUDENT: I have been reading the English translation of the Bassui letters23 during your morning lecture,\nas you suggested I do. At onepoint Bassui says: “Who is the Master that moves the hands?” ROSHI: There\nis no real answer to “Who?” “What?” or “Why?” Whyis sugar sweet? Sugar is sugar. Sugar! STUDENT: You\ntold me earlier, “You are You!” All right, I am I—I accept that. Isn’t this enough? What more need I do? Why\nmust Ikeep struggling with this question? ROSHI: Because this understanding is external to you—you\ndon’treally know what you mean by “I am I.” You must come up againstthis question with the force of a\nbomb, and all your intellectualnotions and ideas must be annihilated. The only way to resolve\nthisquestion is to come to the explosive inner realization thateverything is [ultimately reducible to]\nNothing. If yourunderstanding is merely theoretical, you will forever ask “Who?”“What?” and “Why?”\n…\n6.

We want to know “how” precisely to do that\ninquiry, which is completely understandable. The thing is that it’s not wholly conveyable by describing a\ncertain technique. Really it’s a matter of finding that sweet spot where surrender and intention meet. I will\ndescribe an approach here, but it’s important to keep in mind that in the end, you don’t have the power\n(as what you take yourself to be) to wake yourself up. Only Life has that power. So as we give ourselves to\na certain inquiry or practice it’s imperative that we remain open. We have to keep the portals open to\nmystery, and possibility. We have to recognize that the constant concluding that “no this isn’t it, no this\nisn’t it either...” is simply the activity of the mind. Those are thoughts. If we believe a single thought then\nwe will believe the next one and on and on. If however we recognize that, “oh that doubt is simply a\nthought arising now,” then we have the opportunity to recognize that that thought will subside on its\nown... and yet “I” as the knower of that thought am still here! We can now become fascinated with what is\nhere once that thought (or any thought) subsides. What is in this gap between thoughts? What is this pure\nsense of I, pure sense of knowing, pure sense of Being? What is this light that can shine on and illuminate\na thought (as it does thousands of times per day), and yet still shines when no thought is present. It is self\nilluminating. What is the nature of the one that notices thoughts, is awake and aware before, during, and\nafter a thought, and is not altered in any way by any thought? Please understand that when you ask these\nquestions you are not looking for a thought answer, the answer is the experience itself.\nWhen we start to allow our attention to relax into this wider perspective we start to unbind ourselves\nfrom thought. We begin to recognize the nature of unbound consciousness by feel, by instinct. This is the\nway in.\nAt first we may conclude that this gap, this thoughtless consciousness is uninteresting, unimportant. It\nfeels quite neutral, and the busy mind can’t do anything with neutral so we might be inclined to purposely\nengage thoughts again. If we recognize that “not interesting, not important, not valuable” are all thoughts\nand simply return to this fluid consciousness, it will start to expand. But there is no need to think about\nexpansion or watch for it. It will do this naturally if we stay with it. If you are willing to recognize every\nthought and image in the mind as such, and keep your attention alert but relaxed into the “stuff” of\nthought that is continuous with the sense of I, it will all take care of itself. Just be willing to suspend\njudgement. Be willing to forego conclusions. Be willing to let go of all monitoring of your progress,\nbecause these are all thoughts. Be open to the pure experience. Just return again and again to this place\nof consciousness with no object or pure sense of I Am. If you are willing to do this it will teach itself to you\nin a way that neither I nor anyone I’ve ever seen can explain, but it is more real than real.\nHappy Travels.\nWhat the I AM Realization Is Not\n177\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe key aspect that distinguishes I AM realization from I AM experience is that there is the quality of\ncomplete doubtless certainty of Self that is unshakeable, a Eureka moment where you have found out what\nyou truly are, and that certainty remains from that point onwards.\nFurthermore - the I AM is not a fabricated state. It is Unfabricated Presence-Awareness. You do not\n“cultivate” the I AM Presence. It is not merely a state of Witnessing to be maintained. It is not a maintenance\nstate. It is not a state to be reached through effort and cultivation. Instead it is discovered and directly\nrealized to be one’s doubtless shining core of Existence, much like the clouds dissipating (our\nmisidentification with perceived objects of mind and body as self) revealing the shining sun that was all\nalong present but never noticed.\nIf one has an experience of being a Witness or enter into a state of Witnessing, but it needs to be\n“maintained” or is felt to be “gained” or “lost”, even if one intuits that Witness to be ever-present, that is still\nan “experience” but not “realization” (see the classifications above). This does not mean after the I AM\nrealization one can never be distracted by thoughts ever, it just means there is a kind of unshakeable\ncertainty of Being that is never lost. You realized this is You without a shadow of doubt, as the ground of\nBeing. As John Tan puts it, “Being freed from individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all phenomenon\nmerely pop in and out from the background of the AMness. The AMness is not experienced as an ‘entity’ residing\nanywhere, neither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take\nplace. Even in the moment of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing\nthe ‘Real’ as clear as it can be. We cannot lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-emerges\nfrom it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going. This \"AMness\" is God.”\nThe I AM is also not something that one can only “experience” during a state of meditative trance at a\nfaraway mountain shielded from daily life. Someone who realized I AM will come to understand, as John\nTan puts it in 2007, “AMness has limitless potential and must be expressed in a relative world in constant\ninteraction.” As the source and ground of everything, AMness is seen to have infinite potentiality to express\nin, through and as everything.\nThe I AM Presence as discovered in Self-Realization is a non-dual, Self-Aware Presence of Being. You realize\nyourself to be a shining Aware-Presence, but it is not a subject-object awareness where “you” know you are\na “presence” that is “aware”, it is not ‘you’ knowing Presence (subject knowing object) but there is only You\nBeing Presence-Awareness. It is a non-dual direct realization and direct taste of Mind. At a later phase, this\nnon-dual luminous taste of ‘existence’ is brought from the background to the foreground into all\nmanifestation, which will be elaborated on in the further chapters of this guide.\n“After Self-Realization, there is a doubtless certainty of Being that was never lost, so I no longer needed to\ndo self inquiry. I had a certainty that Awareness is what I am, and it is not a maintenance state, not\nsomething I can 'gain' and 'lose'.” - Soh, 2018\n178\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“You experience of 'Iness\" has not come to a point of stillness yet. That is why it is not that sort of Realization\nI am looking at.” - John Tan to Soh in 2009, one year prior to Soh’s realization of I AM\nIf you are still unsure if what you had is a glimpse of recognition or experience of I AM or the doubtless Self-\nRealization, check out this article - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/i-am-\nexperienceglimpserecognition-vs-i.html.\n'Watch your mind, how it comes into being, how it operates. As you watch your mind, you discover your\nself as the watcher. When you stand motionless, only watching, you discover your self as the light behind\nthe watcher. The source of light is dark, unknown is the source of knowledge. That source alone is. Go\nback to that source and abide there'\nNM, Page 151, 'I am That'\nThe I AM realization is not the same as mundane meditative experiences of clarity, bliss and non-thought.\nIf one experiences meditative states, they should be abruptly interrupted with a KATZ, a Phat, or a Zen\nmaster’s whack so that you snap out of that meditation mood or any coarse or subtle thought into Instant\nPresence prior to concepts.\n“Not fixating outwardly or holding inwardly is the shamatha without support, an indiffernet state that needs\nto be blown apart. After shouting PHAT, the abiding is destroyed. Here, when you simply rest, there is no\nthought going on, but there is still some subtle fixation on that stillness and that has to collapse. After you\nshout a sudden, very strong, and sharp PHAT, the abiding and not abiding are destroyed. It shatters that\nfixation so there is only the dharmakaya awareness left. Then there is a blank and free state, which is\nindescribable. Recognize this as the dharmakaya awareness. This is the introduction to naked dharmakaya\nthrough stillness.\nThere are two different ways of recognizing the essence of mind: when it is still and when it is thinking. The\nintroduction through movement is when a thought arises; here you recognize the one who has thoughts.\nBy recognizing the knower, you are introduced through movement. At that time, simply remain naturally\nfree. In recognizing your own rigpa, the movement disappears. Recognize the dharmakaya awareness.\nAll sentient beings have arising and ceasing (of thought); mind will not only stay or only move. A thought\ndoesn’t arise by itself. It needs the circumstances of a mental or external object, our senses, and our\nconscious mind directed toward that – these three are the basis of movement. There have to be some\nfactors coming together or a thought to arise. Movement comes when there is the external grasped object\nand the internal fixating mind. When thoughts of happiness and sadness arise, if you simply look directly,\nas it is said in the very well-known Mahamudra teachings, then the essence of thought is the dharmakaya.\nWhen a thought arises, if you immediately recognize who is it that thinks, the thought self-vanishes, self-\nevaporates. Once the thought vanishes, there is nothing but unimpeded awareness.\n179\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThoughts do arise and there are different ways of recognizing essence, as I previously mentioned – through\na strong emotion like devotion or compassion, or with the strong exclamation of PHAT, or simply\nrecognizing who it is that thinks. Through any of these ways, the thought will disappears. Recognize (the\nessence of) the thought and the thought will vanish. It will be traceless, as in the example of writing in space.\nIt does not stay; this is the example.” – Dzogchen teacher Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche\nDzogchen teacher Tenzin Wangyal (1997, 29) points out:\n“The gap between two thoughts is essence. But if in that gap there is a lack of presence, it becomes\nignorance and we experience only a lack of awareness, almost an unconsciousness. If there is presence in\nthe gap, then we experience the dharmakaya [the ultimate].”\n(It should be noted that although the I AM realization is the preliminary or beginning realization in many\ndirect paths in Buddhism and outside Buddhism, the I AM realization is not considered the final realization\nin the Dzogchen tradition as explained in Acarya Malcolm on Dzogchen and Advaita Vedanta and The\nDegrees of Rigpa)\n“…the second variety- this need not be said - because such expressions as\n\"scrutiny of mind,\" \"resting in naked awareness\" and so forth are\ncharacteristics of this second type of instruction or approach.\nThe main emphasis in this section of the text and the main emphasis\nin the presentation of such instructions as \"scrutiny of the mind\" and\n\"resting in naked, direct awareness\" is to let go of intellectual contrivance\nsuch as inferential reasoning. Yet, at the same time, having let go of\nintellectualization per se it is possible to deviate in a further way, namely\ninto attachment to experience. While we say that we are concerned with\nexperiential guidance, then there is a type of experience that can arise\nthat can be deceptive, deceptive in a sense that this experience itself can\nalso veil naked awareness, can prevent one from contacting naked\nawareness or experiencing naked awareness directly.\nThere are three different experiences that can arise which can veil\nawareness in that way. The first is an experience of bliss; a traditional\nterm for this is \"being stuck to the glue of the disturbing emotions.\"\nThis is an experience in meditation where, because of the process of\npractice, there is some comfort, bliss and joy, and being delighted in\nthis, one identifies with it. But this bliss is not rig-pa, it is not \"awareness.\"\nA similar thing that can happen is an experience of intense lucidity or\nclarity. One identifies with ir and insists, \"I see this.\" There is an\nexperience of some kind of lucid insight and that can also obscure the\ndirect experience of awareness. There can also be an obscuration through\nthe experience of non-conceptuality. All of these are experiences that are\n180\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ndistinct from realization. While the nature that is realized when one has\nactual realization cannot be said not to be blissful and certainly not to\nbe not lucid, nevertheless the quality of this is very different from the\nquality of mere experience. Mere experience is something the siddhas of\nthe past have said does not last; it is here today and gone tomorrow.\nGetting caught up in experience does veil one's awareness -\n2\nSoh Wei Yu\nbadge icon\nThe last paragraph is great. The difference between experience and realization. The term \"awareness\" here\nseems to be a reference to rigpa. Rigpa is jnana, which Malcolm says should be translated as \"knowledge\"\ninstead of \"awareness\". It means to recognise your true essence.\nRigpa also comes in degrees, as Malcolm pointed out. The initial rigpa is the I AM then later matured into\nanatta/emptiness.\n2\nAnother word is 'gnosis'. It's not intellectual knowledge\nRigpa is also distinguished from other neutral indeterminate states of alaya, a state of indifference and\nnon-recognition even if accompanied with other meditative experiences of clarity, non-thought and bliss.\nRigpa is accompanied with clear certainty about the essence/nature of awareness/mind (and even this\ncomes in various degrees as stated above).\nFor example, as Mipham Rinpoche pointed out here (do read the whole text).\nhttps://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/mipham/mipham-lamp\n\"When you leave your mind in a state of natural rest, without thinking any particular thought, and at the\nsame time maintain some kind of mindfulness, you can experience a state of vacant, neutral, apathetic\nindifference, called “lungmaten”, (a ‘no-man’s land’), where your consciousness is dull and blank.\nIn this, there is not any of the clear insight of vipaśyanā, which discerns things precisely, and so the masters\ncall it marigpa (“non-recognition, ignorance, unknowing”). Since you cannot define it and say “This is what\nit’s like”, or “This is it!” such a state is called lungmaten (“undecided, indeterminate”). And since you cannot\nsay what kind of state it is you are resting in, or what your mind is thinking, it is also called tha mal tang\nnyom (“an ordinary state of apathetic indifference”). In fact, you are stuck in an ordinary state within the\nālaya.\nYou need to use such a means of resting the mind, as a stepping stone, so as to give rise to the non-\nconceptual state of primordial wisdom. However, if there is not the self-recognition of primordial wisdom\n181\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nwhich is our rigpa, then it cannot count as the main (meditation) practice of Dzogchen. As The Aspiration\nPrayer of Samantabhadra says:\nA blank state, devoid of any thought whatsoever—\nThat is marigpa, the cause of delusion.\nTherefore, when mind experiences this kind of dull state that lacks any thought or mental activity, by\nallowing your attention to turn naturally and gently towards the one who is aware of this state—the one\nwho is not thinking—you discover the pure awareness of rigpa, free of any movement of thought, beyond\nany notion of outside or inside, unimpeded and open, like the clear sky.\nAlthough there is no dualistic separation here between an experience and an experiencer, still the mind is\ncertain about its own true nature, and there is a sense that, “There is nothing whatsoever beyond this.”\nWhen this occurs, because you can not conceptualize it or express it in words, it is acceptable to apply such\nterms as: “free from all extremes”, “beyond description”, “the fundamental state of clear light” and “the pure\nawareness of rigpa.”\nAs the wisdom of recognizing your own true nature dawns, it clears away the blinding darkness of\nconfusion, and, just as you can see clearly the inside of your home once the sun has risen, you gain\nconfident certainty in the true nature of your mind.\"”\nQuestion: “\"So the direct path watches the watcher watch the watching . This is \"I am\"?\"\nSoh: In the I AM, there is no watcher-watched, just pure Presence, Being. In other words, in the moment\nof authenticating Presence, you are not watching Presence as if a watcher, you are just Presence Being\nPresence. Self-Aware Beingness/Presence, non-dual. It is pure Awareness, the Witness, etc, but it is not\nmerely a state of witnessing.\nQuestion: \" I'm definitely still fabricating. Subtle fine fabrications. Watching the watcher watch the watcher\nwatch. I feel like I need to go back to. Metta/Bodhi-citta meditation. That was working. Lately meditation is\ncontrived and the relaxation feels like trying to relax in to awareness isn't working.\"\nSoh: I AM is the unfabricated Presence, without the recursive watching the watcher watching the watcher\netc.\nAt the moment you pause all concepts, all fabrication, what is left? There is an undeniable naked luminous\nsheer sense of Existence, Presence-Awareness, without a trace of separation into a watcher and object\nwatched.\nAwareness aware of itself is simply awareness being itself. Self-aware presence.\nThe mistake you seem to make is objectifying the watcher or awareness. Awareness is not an object outside\nof yourself to be sought or watched. There is no duality in it. It is pure naked Presence. It is You, your very\nessence.\n182\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nYou may find these pointers by Ken Wilber useful: https://www.lionsroar.com/so-who-are-you/ and\nhttps://integrallife.com/always-already-the-brilliant-clarity-of-ever-present-awareness/\n….\n“\"If We talk of knowing the Self, there must be two selves, one a knowing self, another the self which is\nknown, and the process of knowing. The state we call realisation is simply being oneself, not knowing\nanything or becoming anything. If one has realised, one is that which alone is and which alone has always\nbeen. One cannot describe that state. One can only be that. Of course, we loosely talk of Self-realisation,\nfor want of a better term. How to 'real-ise' or make real that which alone is real?'” – Ramana Maharshi, ‘Be\nAs You Are’ – a highly recommended book for those practicing Self-Enquiry https://www.amazon.com/Be-\nAs-You-Are-Teachings/dp/0140190627\nWhy Realize the I AM (Can I skip straight away to more “advanced stages” like anatta?)\nSome people wonder if it is necessary to go through the I AM realization before they realize further stages\nof insight like Anatta (Stage 5). While possible, it is easy to miss out certain aspects like the luminous\nPresence. One can have non-dual experiences but it is dry and barren without the luminous taste of\nPresence-Awareness. Furthermore, as discussed towards the end of this document, the stages are not to\nbe seen as purely linear progression nor as a measurement of importance -- even the first phase of I AM\nRealization is important as it brings out the luminous essence. Actually, the taste of Stage 1 (I AM) and Stage\n4 and 5 is similar, only the insight and view is different. At Stage 4, John Tan wrote that it is the same\nluminous taste as the direct taste of Mind (called “I AM”) but now extended to all six senses.\n“[11:25 AM, 6/6/2020] John Tan: People that do not go through the phases of insights between I AM will not\nknow the difference but it is important to go through I AM to realize the intensity.” - \"Frank Yang\" Eating\nShow (Enlightened Mukbang)\nIn 2009, John Tan wrote:\n\"Hi Teck Cheong,\nWhat you described is fine and it can be considered vipassana meditation too but you must be clear what\nis the main objective of practicing that way. Ironically, the real purpose only becomes obvious after the\narising insight of anatta. What I gathered so far from your descriptions are not so much about anatta or\nempty nature of phenomena but are rather drawn towards Awareness practice. So it will be good to start\nfrom understanding what Awareness truly is. All the method of practices that you mentioned will lead to a\nquality of experience that is non-conceptual. You can have non-conceptual experience of sound,\ntaste...etc...but more importantly in my opinion, you should start from having a direct, non-conceptual\nexperience of Awareness (first glimpse of our luminous essence). Once you have a ‘taste’ of what Awareness\n183\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nis, you can then think of ‘expanding’ this bare awareness and gradually understand what does ‘heightening\nand expanding’ mean from the perspective of Awareness.\nNext, although you hear and see ‘non-dual, anatta and dependent origination’ all over the place in An\nEternal Now’s forum (the recent Toni Packer’s books you bought are about non-dual and anatta), there is\nnothing wrong being ‘dualistic’ for a start. Even after direct non-conceptual experience of Awareness, our\nview will still continue to be dualistic; so do not have the idea that being dualistic is bad although it prevents\nthorough experience of liberation.\nThe comment given by Dharma Dan is very insightful but of late, I realized that it is important to have a first\nglimpse of our luminous essence directly before proceeding into such understanding. Sometimes\nunderstanding something too early will deny oneself from actual realization as it becomes conceptual. Once\nthe conceptual understanding is formed, even qualified masters will find it difficult to lead the practitioner\nto the actual ‘realization’ as a practitioner mistakes conceptual understanding for realization.\nRgds,\nJohn\"\n“The anatta I realized is quite unique. It is not just a realization of no-self. But it must first have an intuitive\ninsight of Presence. Otherwise will have to reverse the phases of insights.” - John Tan, 2018\n“(1:28 AM) Thusness: complete stillness, ultimate, without thoughts\ncomplete certainty.

This will prevent their progress as they\nwill fail to appreciate and realize the depth of luminous presence, and their understanding of anatta and\nemptiness remains intellectual. It should be understood that the I AM realization does not contradict Anatta\nrealization but complements it. It is the “original face before your parents were born” of Zen, and the\nunfabricated clarity in Dzogchen that serves as initial rigpa, it is also the initial certainty of Mind discovered\nin the first of the four yogas of Mahamudra (see: Clarifying the Natural State by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal).\nCalling it “I AM” is just another name for the same thing, and you should also know that AtR’s definition of I\nAM is different from Buddhism’s term “conceit of I Am” or Nisargadatta’s I Am. The I AM of AtR is a direct\ntaste and realization of the Mind of Clear Light.\nThe view gets refined and the taste gets brought to effortless maturity and non-contrivance in all\nmanifestation as one’s insights deepen.\nAs John Tan also said in 2011:\n“John: what is \"I AM\"\nis it a pce? (Soh: PCE = pure consciousness experience, see glossary at the bottom of this document)\nis there emotion\nis there feeling\nis there thought\nis there division or complete stillness?\nin hearing there is just sound, just this complete, direct clarity of sound!\nso what is \"I AM\"?\nSoh Wei Yu: it is the same\njust that pure non conceptual thought\nJohn: is there 'being'?\nSoh Wei Yu: no, an ultimate identity is created as an afterthought\nJohn: indeed\nit is the mis-interpretation after that experience that is causing the confusion\nthat experience itself is pure conscious experience\nthere is nothing that is impure\nthat is why it is a sense of pure existence\n186\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nit is only mistaken due to the 'wrong view'\nso it is a pure conscious experience in thought.\nnot sound, taste, touch...etc\nPCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) is about direct and pure experience of whatever we encounter in\nsight, sound, taste...\nthe quality and depth of experience in sound\nin contacts\nin taste\nin scenery\nhas he truly experience the immense luminous clarity in the senses?\nif so, what about 'thought'?\nwhen all senses are shut\nthe pure sense of existence as it is when the senses are shut.\nthen with senses open\nhave a clear understanding\ndo not compare irrationally without clear understanding”\n“...There is nothing underneath everything, in the state of I AM, it is just I AM. The rest of the 5 sense doors\nare shut. Everything else is excluded. It is called I simply because of the koan, nothing else.\nWhat’s experienced is similar to hearing sound without the sense of hearer. So keep the experience but\nrefine the view.” - John Tan to someone in Awakening to Reality Discussion Group (note: this group is now\nclosed, however you can join to access the old discussions.

The so called formless is\nreally another appearance, another manifestation, not any different from the appearance of a color, a\nsound. A sound is not a sight, but a sound is a manifestation, an appearance. A sight is not a sound, but a\nsight is a manifestation, an appearance. A sensations is not a sound, but it is manifestation, appearance.\nThe I AM is likewise just another appearance, it is of the Mind door and therefore you say it is not a sight,\nnot a sound. That I AM or Mind (pure sense of formless Presence-Awareness even when five senses are\nshut) is formless because it is not visually seen nor auditorily heard (because it is the Mind door, not the\nvisual or auditory sense door) but it is still a manifestation. But it is really just another appearance, a\nmanifestation. You do not say Presence allows appearance, for Presence is just appearances in all its\ndiversities. In other words, Presence has not just one particular face but ten thousand faces.”\nThe view of anatta, dependent origination and emptiness is very different from Advaita, so while you\nintellectually understand this point, continue to do self enquiry which works on a different set of\nassumptions. Don't get disturbed by whether Presence is self or not self while doing self enquiry, or on\nanatta, etc. Just direct realize the Awareness/Presence/I AM first. If you get disturbed by thinking or\nconcepts, you will never come to the Certainty of Being-Existence. As a matter of fact, that doubtless taste\nof luminous Presence does not contradict anatta, but complements it when properly understood. Merely\nunderstanding anatta without the direct taste of Presence is dry and nihilistic or merely intellectual.\nHowever after you realize Presence (I AM), then non dual, then anatta and dependent origination and\nemptiness, you will start to see and appreciate that Buddha's view and insight is profound.\nJohn Tan told me in 2008, “Although the 'teaching of anatta' helps to prevent you from landing into wrong\nviews, the downside is it also denies you from experiencing that deep and ultimate conviction, that certainty\nbeyond doubt of your very own existence -- \"I AM'. This is a very important factor for Advaita practitioners.\nThe next important factor is the duration of this non-dual experience must be prolonged; long enough for\nyou to enter into a sort of absorption that the experience becomes 'oceanic'.”\n191\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAlthough I had an intellectual understanding of anatta, emptiness and dependent origination since 2006, I\n(Soh) did not let it disturb my self-enquiry and my self enquiry between 2008 to February 2010\nculminated in Self-Realization.\nFurthermore, someone just asked me (Soh) about self-enquiry vs noting path.\nHe asked, “Do you guys recommend self inquiry over mahasi-style noting? If so, why?”\nI (Soh) wrote in reply:\n“There is something sweet, beautiful and attractive in Awareness teachings even back when I was\nbeginning to explore spirituality in 2004-2006. I was naturally drawn to it. I was also brought to dharma by\nmy mother and took refuge in the triple gems under Venerable Shen Kai whose lineage is the Ch’an\ntradition. His teachings is heavily Awareness-centered and it resonated with me then. That was also when\nI first met John and he told me about his insights. I was very happy when I discovered The Power of Now\nby Eckhart Tolle in 2006, which I felt to be a potent book at bringing readers to a direct glimpse and state\nof Presence. (This is now still my ‘starter book’ which I pass to my friends and relatives as an introduction\nto spirituality)\nPure noting would not suit me or my character because it would have felt dry and barren to me. That taste\nof Presence, a direct taste of Spirit or the Heart seems missing in those practices. Which I was already\nhaving glimpses of, as early as 2006-2007 (a few years before doubtless Self-Realization arose)\nBut through awareness teachings and the practice of self-enquiry when I AM realization arose, all further\nprogressions are based on the maturing of insight in relation to that nondual luminous taste of presence.\nHowever if you are drawn to MCTB approach there is nothing wrong pursuing noting and the path as\noutlined there. The luminosity aspect is eventually brought forth at the 3rd path of MCTB and matures at\n4th and post-4th (Daniel’s exploration of AF practices).\nYou have to gauge and see for yourself which approach you felt more resonance with.”\n“Soh Wei Yu\nAngelo Gerangelo\nshared this days ago in his group:\nThe practices I recommend are usually momentary and arise from the conditions of the interaction at\nthat moment. I do recommend simple meditation / presence practice on a consistent daily basis. You can\nuse a technique or not (shikan taza). Also it’s good to develop a sense of when inquiry is most relevant\n192\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nand when practicing no practice is most relevant. This can take some time to hone the intuition, but it’s\ncertainly possible. The practice of no-practice is spontaneity, alertness, contact, and innocent regard for\nmomentary flow of life.\nA few books I often recommend: Emptiness Dancing, Power of Now, Three Pillars of Zen.\nEmotion work such as focusing can be very useful as well.\nJeff Foster talks about acceptance in similar ways to focusing techniques. I like his book The Deepest\nAcceptance as well.\nAny kind of body/energy work such as hatha yoga, qi gong, tai chi also valuable.\nTry things and feel into what you resonate with the most. Trust your own innate awake nature, it knows...\nit got you this far\nThat’s what’s coming to mind currently.\n4\nMichael Zaurov\nTo learn focusing I highly recommend the book The Power of Focusing by Ann Weiser Cornell. It's short\nand practical and gives you all the tools you need for emotional work (which i've found to be very very\nimportant for awakening)\n3\nAngelo Gerangelo\nI also added this:\nIn my experience the most important aspect of your approach to awakening and realization is the\ncommitment to it-not learning about it, understanding it, or even attaching rigidly to specific practices\nsuch as meditation. This means an intent and commitment to break through the barriers of what you\ntake yourself to be. If you prioritize that, the right practices, teachers, and life events will coalesce to\ndeliver it. Trusting in realization, the process itself, trusting the intuition that you aren’t here to suffer.\nCall it a heart level commitment. It’s willingness to go through what you’ll have to got through to let reality\nsort you out, even if you don’t like some aspects of it.\nBe willing to let go of any beliefs and views you have, even those about spirituality.\nThis is the price of admission.\n3\nThomas Arta\nMichael Zaurov\nyes to Ann Weiser Cornell. Focusing is an incredibly powerful tool. Thanks for mentioning this.\n2\nSoh Wei Yu\n193\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nI havent read emptiness dancing, but i can recommend the power of now and three pillars of zen\nAngelo Gerangelo\nHey Chris. There are very good answers here to your question. I would take all of them into consideration.\nHere’s something that may or may not be helpful.\nIt’s very common to approach awakening through analytical means initially. Indeed it’s almost impossible\nnot to. The fact that you recognize that it’s not going to get you where you want to go is more profound\nthan maybe you realize. While it’s frustrating, your instinct to go beyond that analytical approach,\nespecially for initial awakening, is right on the money. The good news is that going beyond thought, that\nwill always happen right now. If you think in terms of strategies that will take some time, that’s sort of\ndelaying things and not recognizing the opportunity immediately here.\nFor instance when you notice you are contemplating a specific topic about spirituality, whether it’s about\nhow you can wake up, what is the best technique, what book should I read etc, even the thought “I’m too\nlogical”, THAT is your opportunity! Recognize the fact that you just recognized a thought. The fact that you\nrecognized it as a thought means you aren’t identified with it at least in that moment. So then clarify the\nthought, like speak it internally. “I wish I knew the best book to read about Buddhism” or “I wander what\nI’m doing something wrong” Doesn’t matter the actual thought, just that you clearly see it as a thought.\nNow once you do that, you can Inquire in several ways. You can try and see which seem to get traction\n(meaning lead to a thoughtless state, an awake gap, a living movement in consciousness that is not\nlanding on any thought and yet you are still totally alert). Even if this is for a few seconds, you’re on the\nright track. Keep at it.\nSo once you are in Contact with that thought here are some inquiry questions. Obviously you aren’t\nlooking for a thought answer only experiential. If you find yourself answering with thought that’s fine, just\nrecognize that next thought as the point of inquiry and start over.\nWhat is this thought made out of?\nCan I come into contact with that thought stuff ?\nThese two questions can be regarded as if you were watching thoughts like images on a movie screen. It\nwould be as if you are walking closer and closer to that screen like you wanted to see what that light stuff\nis that’s shining on the screen. With a movie screen you could walk right up until it blurs out, try it with a\nthought. You can even try to turn right around into that source of light.\nYou can ask:\nHow would it feel if I never resolved this question or thought? , then look/feel there.\nWhat if stepped off the end of that question/thought and never looked back? Try it\nWhat if I ask and then had no desire to answer bc the answer would be another thought? Where can you\nlook now?\nYou can ask what is in the gap between this thought and the one right before, then put your attention\ninto that gap and keep it there.\nYou can ask who is it that wants to resolve this question?\n194\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAnd try to find that one (me) experientially like you dropped a pin on the carpet and you got down on\nyour hands and knees to look\nYou can ask what right HERE is not a concept or a thought?\nYou can ask what does a thought form IN? Then watch for the next thought to form and then watch it\ndissipate. What is that medium in which that occurred?\nAsk: who’s thoughts are these? Then look for that one?\n______\nA couple of important points.\nOne is it’s actually not hard to find that gap and even stay in it for a few seconds. What deters most\npeople, is we actually begin to feel uncomfortable if we really work it this, especially at first. You can have\nan intense physiologic reaction or a fear respond sometimes. Often before we even realize that’s what’s\nhappening we just get distracted and go do some thing else. So it can be valuable to work past emotional\nor physiological responses. Meaning just recognize them and let them be but don’t let them deter you.\nOn the contrary it can be “suspiciously” neutral experience without thoughts. At least initially. The thinking\nmind can’t do anything with thoughtless awakeness so it deems it unimportant or even thinks it didn’t\nhappen. Don’t let that deter you, keep on. It won’t stay neutral. Rather, it will remain neutral in one sense,\nbut that opens a very important space for some shifts to occur that you can’t think your way into.\nGood luck. Let me know if any of that is helpful or need more pointers\n5\n·\nReply\n· 2d\n·\nEdited“\n“Regarding whether it is important to go through I AM realization or can we skip to anatta -- John Tan and I\nand Sim Pern Chong have had differing and evolving opinions about this over the years (I remember Sim\nPern Chong saying he thinks people can skip it altogether, John also wondered if it is possible or advisable\nas certain AF people seem to have skipped it but experience luminosity), however after witnessing the\nprogress of people it seems to us that those who went into anatta without the I AM realization tend to miss\nout the luminosity and intensity of luminosity. And then they will have to go through another phase. For\nthose with I AM realization, the second stanza of anatta comes very easily, in fact the first aspect to become\nmore apparent. Nowadays John and my opinion is that it is best to go through the I AM phase, then nondual\nand anatta..\nThere was also the worry that by leading people into the I AM, they can get stuck there. (As John Tan and\nSim Pern Chong was stuck there for decades)\n195\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nBut I have shown that it is possible to progress rather quickly (in eight months) from I AM to anatta. So the\nbeing stuck is due to lack of right pointers and directions, not inherently an issue with I AM.” - Soh, 2020\nOn a related topic, John Tan wrote in Dharma Overground back in 2009,\n“Hi Gary,\nIt appears that there are two groups of practitioners in this forum, one adopting the gradual approach and\nthe other, the direct path. I am quite new here so I may be wrong.\nMy take is that you are adopting a gradual approach yet you are experiencing something very significant in\nthe direct path, that is, the ‘Watcher’. As what Kenneth said, “You're onto something very big here, Gary.\nThis practice will set you free.” But what Kenneth said would require you to be awaken to this ‘I’. It requires\nyou to have the ‘eureka!’ sort of realization. Awaken to this ‘I’, the path of spirituality becomes clear; it is\nsimply the unfolding of this ‘I’.\nOn the other hand, what that is described by Yabaxoule is a gradual approach and therefore there is\ndownplaying of the ‘I AM’. You have to gauge your own conditions, if you choose the direct path, you cannot\ndownplay this ‘I’; contrary, you must fully and completely experience the whole of ‘YOU’ as ‘Existence’.\nEmptiness nature of our pristine nature will step in for the direct path practitioners when they come face\nto face to the ‘traceless’, ‘centerless’ and ‘effortless’ nature of non-dual awareness.\nPerhaps a little on where the two approaches meet will be of help to you.\nAwakening to the ‘Watcher’ will at the same time ‘open’ the ‘eye of immediacy’; that is, it is the capacity to\nimmediately penetrate discursive thoughts and sense, feel, perceive without intermediary the perceived. It\nis a kind of direct knowing. You must be deeply aware of this “direct without intermediary” sort of\nperception -- too direct to have subject-object gap, too short to have time, too simple to have thoughts. It\nis the ‘eye’ that can see the whole of ‘sound’ by being ‘sound’. It is the same ‘eye’ that is required when doing\nvipassana, that is, being ‘bare’. Be it non-dual or vipassana, both require the opening of this 'eye of\nimmediacy'.”\n“2007:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../normal-0-false... -\nThusness: Ok, there are two things you must know. In the three (or four) dharma seals, the universal seals\n(characteristics of existence), there is the understanding of no-self, there is impermanence, there is\nsuffering and there is nirvana. Entering from the door of impermanence is different from entering the\ndoor of no-self.\n196\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nParticipant 1: If I observe how the thoughts behave and realise it from there?\nThusness: Now you see, there are two things. One thing is that when you observe the arising and the\npassing away of the moment. Of every arising of your thoughts. When you observe the arising and\npassing away, it can also lead to the understanding of no-self, but from the door of impermanence. This\nmeans that Self is seen as a series: Self1, Self2, Self3, that does not remain, from moment to moment it\nchanges. You see what I mean?\nParticipant 1: Yep.\nThusness: However, a person that enters through the door of no-self, means understanding no-self\ndirectly, he enters through luminosity. That is more like a mirror bright, but he cannot understand the\nluminosity due to momentum, then he separates the external world and the internal world. But the no-\nself itself will break this mirror, then he will see that everything is the Mind. Do you get it? One is from the\nluminosity door. No-self leads to the mirror bright, and then breaking the mirror and then experience\neverything as the nature. The other one that leads to no-self is through the understanding of\nimpermanence.\nParticipant 1: {inaudible}\nThusness: Ok. Now, the understanding of these two is important, it must later be fused into one to\nunderstand what Emptiness about. This means there is no point of reference, there is no centricity, there\nis no where, there is no when, there is no I, but there is manifestation all and everywhere. If you enter the\ngate of impermanence, later you have to experience no-self from luminosity, then you have to fuse the\ntwo, then you have to stabilise the two, then you can understand Emptiness.\nParticipant 1: It’s like, I tend to want to see and perceive things without concept through the door of the\nmantra, the momentum. How does that relate?\nThusness: If you want to do that, you are going into mindfulness. That means you are slowly from\nimpermanence seeing that things arises and ceases, leading to no-self, and then leading you to insight.\nThat is the luminosity aspect already.”\nFor those interested in Vipassana practice, see chapter Vipassana, John Tan’s Style but keep in mind that\nthe luminosity, and luminous manifestation needs to be brought out.\n2006 Conversations with Thusness:\n(10:41 PM) John: AMness to no-self, no-self to emptiness, spontaneous arising\n(10:41 PM) John: this must be the steps\n(10:42 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:42 PM) John: it is no good to skip level\n(10:42 PM) AEN: oic\n(10:42 PM) John: cause there will be no true understanding.\n(10:42 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:44 PM) AEN: is AMness a stage tat all buddhists also go through?\n(10:44 PM) John: nope...but it is better to go through...i think it is a very important stage.\n(10:45 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:45 PM) AEN: how come important?\n197\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(10:46 PM) John: without no-self as a yuan, it is really difficult to go beyond AMness and refine our\nexperience and understanding of pristine awareness\n(10:46 PM) AEN: oic\n(10:46 PM) John: i do not know how to if one did not come into contact with buddhism doctrine of no-self\nand emptiness\n(10:47 PM) John: it is very very subtle\n(10:47 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:47 PM) John: even one has entered the stream, it still require quite a period for one to stabilize the\nexperience.\n(10:47 PM) AEN: oic\n(10:48 PM) John: but mindfulness can lead directly to no-self\n(10:48 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:48 PM) John: without going through AMness\n(10:48 PM) AEN: oic\n(10:48 PM) John: I AMness is a mystical path.\n(10:48 PM) AEN: shamatha can lead to amness?\n(10:49 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:49 PM) John: yes but a person if has the correct \"yuan\" entering into \"AMness\" will know the No-Self is\nthe way and the correct path.\n(10:50 PM) AEN: oic\n(10:50 PM) John: it is like finding the correct medicine for a disease....when one taste it, one will know...\n(10:50 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:50 PM) John: one will know it is the next stage when one experience\n(10:51 PM) John: and when no-self is stabilized, one knows about emptiness is the next stage\n(10:51 PM) AEN: oic..\n(10:52 PM) John: and spontaneous arising though is experienced in each and every stage, one after\nthorough understanding, one knows that after the purification of no-self and emptiness, it can then be\nconsidered the real experience of unconditioned arising...the still water flows...(i like this description)\n(10:52 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:54 PM) John: you may want to ask longchen himself.\n(10:54 PM) John: it is like a medicine for \"I AMness\"\n(10:54 PM) AEN: ask him about ?\n(10:54 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:55 PM) John: it is like the natural progression for the next stage\n......\n(12:08 AM) John: it is okie to tok about the One Mind.\n(12:09 AM) John: i tell you this is because i don't want you to think that \"I AMness\" is wrong.\n(12:09 AM) AEN: oic\n(12:09 AM) John: it is a natural progression.\n(12:09 AM) AEN: icic\n(12:10 AM) John: you must also realised that even if one get trained to quite a high stage in mindfulness in\nsensing and being present, he is unable to fuse into everything\n(12:10 AM) AEN: how come?\n(12:11 AM) John: but if he experience \"I AMness\" and go into mindfulness, his progress will be more\nthorough and profound.\n(12:11 AM) John: his understanding will be deeper.\n198\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(12:11 AM) John: because he will struggle between the source and no-self and emptiness until true\nunderstanding arise\n(12:11 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:12 AM) John: from \"I AMness\" to experiencing presence, one must know anatta and emptiness\n(12:13 AM) John: but when when go directly into anatta, one cannot really appreciate...this is what i find\nout after reading so much books by great meditator.\n(12:14 AM) John: why?\n(12:14 AM) John: because of the cultural setting\n(12:14 AM) John: india has a very strong cultural background on the 'Self'\n(12:14 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:15 AM) John: so many great mystics if given the yuan when they experience no-self knows the depth\n(12:15 AM) AEN: icic..\n(12:15 AM) John: this you must be aware.\n(12:16 AM) John: that is why i sense his condition for breaking-through no-self is pretty strong.\n(12:16 AM) John: but his yuan in buddhism is strong.\n(12:16 AM) John: unlike bob.\n(12:16 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:16 AM) AEN: how you know bob no yuan with buddhism?

There are some other descriptions however that state that to be a hua-tou the\nfocus/looking-into should be done in that moment before the thought arises?”\nSoh replied, “In Self Enquiry, I asked \"Before birth, Who am I?\"\nThe point of self enquiry is really to investigate (and this process of investigation consists of an earnest\ncuriosity and inquisitiveness) and direct the mind to the Source. The Source which is prior to everything -\nthoughts, perceptions, etc. So that That which is what you truly are, the I AM prior to \"I am this\" or \"I am\nthat\", can be directly realized in complete certainty without a trace of doubt.\nJesus said, “Before Abraham was, I AM”. That I AM that I AM is what's present five millenias ago, present five\nminutes ago, present Now, present before the koan is asked, in fact the original face before your parents\nwere born, before the big bang, before time and space, before everything perceivable and conceivable.\nThe purpose of generating doubt is not to create endless doubt but to direct the mind to the Source so that\nthe very doubt resolves into the Doubtless Self/Beingness that is revealed in its shining radiance.\nThe doubt is itself the inquisitiveness and curiosity (an important key element to successful self-enquiry -\notherwise the thought 'Who am I?' will just be a monotonous and robotic mental chanting like a mantra\nrather than lead the mind to the Source) to really find out the truth of your Being. You have to ask \"Who\nam I?\" like you really, really mean it, like you really, really want to find out what you truly are at the core of\nyour Being and unlock the secret of Existence. Like, what the hell, after all these years living on this planet,\nwhat is at the core of this wondrous Life itself? What is this Existence? What am I??? I've seen many things\nin life and lived for so many years, but WHO is living this Life? Who is seeing, hearing, smelling? Who is\ndragging this corpse along? That's the meaning of doubt, nothing else.\n200\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nTo use an analogy of Ramana Maharshi, the doubt is the stick used for stirring the funeral pyre, to be finally\ndissolved in the end (into the Source).\n\"The mind will subside only by means of the enquiry 'Who am I?'. The thought 'Who am I?', destroying all\nother thoughts, will itself finally be destroyed like the stick used for stirring the funeral pyre.\" - Ramana\nMaharshi””\nSomeone else asked, “Why is \"before birth, what am I?\" being advocated? Why would we assume we were\nanything \"before birth\"?”\nSoh replied, “Before any observable five senses or conceptual phenomena, what are you? There is a\ndoubtless Presence before senses. But don’t intellectualize the question or ponder conceptually while\nenquiring. The purpose of self-enquiry is to have a direct non-conceptual realization of Self/Presence, so\nany conceptual rumination will be an obstruction during the practice of self-enquiring.\n“When the Body Disappears.\nRemember \"con men,\" \"con women\" as well. These con men can sell you anything! There's one living in your mind\nright now, and you believe every word he says! His name is Thinking. When you let go of that inner talk and get\nsilent, you get happy. Then when you let go of the movement of the mind and stay with the breath, you experience\neven more delight. Then when you let go of the body ,all these five senses disappear and you're really blissing out.\nThis is original Buddhism. Sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch completely vanish. This is like being in a sensory\ndeprivation chamber but much better. But it's not just silence, you just don't hear anything. It's not just blackness,\nyou just don't see anything. It's not just a feeling of comfort in the body, there is no body at all.\nWhen the body disappears that really starts to feel great. You know of all those people who have out of the body\nexperiences? When the body dies, every person has that experience, they float out of the body. And one of the\nthings they always say is it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful. It's the same in meditation when the body\ndisappears, it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful when you are free from this body. What's left? Here there's no\nsight, sound, smell, taste, touch. This is what the Buddha called the mind in deep meditation. When the body\ndisappears what is left is the mind.\nI gave a simile to a monk the other night. Imagine an Emperor who is wearing a long pair of trousers and a big\ntunic. He's got shoes on his feet, a scarf around the bottom half of his head and a hat on the top half of his head.\nYou can't see him at all because he's completely covered in five garments. It's the same with the mind. It's\ncompletely covered with sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. So people don't know it. They just know the garments.\nWhen they see the Emperor, they just see the robes and the garments. They don't know who lives inside them. And\nso it is no wonder they're confused about what is life, what is mind, who is this inside of here, where did I come\nfrom? Why? What am I supposed to be doing with this life? When the five senses disappear, it's like unclothing the\nEmperor and seeing what is actually in here, what's actually running the show, who's listening to these words,\n201\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nwho's seeing, who's feeling life, who this is. When the five senses disappear, you're coming close to the answer to\nthose questions.\nWhat you're seeing in such deep meditation is that which we call \"mind,\" (in Pali it's called Citta). The Buddha\nused this beautiful simile. When there is a full moon on a cloudy night, even though it's a full moon, you can\nhardly see it. Sometimes when the clouds are thin, you can see this hazy shape shining though. You know there is\nsomething there. This is like the meditation just before you've entered into these profound states. You know there\nis something there, but you can't quite make it out. There's still some \"clothes\" left. You're still thinking and doing,\nfeeling the body or hearing sounds. But there does come a time, and this is the Buddha's simile, when the moon\nis released from the clouds and there in the clear night sky you can see the beautiful full disc of the moon shining\nbrilliantly, and you know that's the moon. The moon is there; the moon is real, and it's not just some sort of side\neffect of the clouds. This is what happens in meditation when you see the mind. You see clearly that the mind is\nnot some side effect of the brain. You see the mind, and you know the mind. The Buddha said that the mind\nreleased is beautiful, is brilliant, is radiant. So not only are these blissful experiences, they're meaningful\nexperiences as well.\nHow many people may have heard about rebirth but still don't really believe it? How can rebirth happen? Certainly\nthe body doesn't get reborn. That's why when people ask me where do you go when you die, \"one of two places\"\nI say \"Fremantle or Karrakatta\" that's where the body goes! [3] But is that where the mind goes? Sometimes people\nare so stupid in this world, they think the body is all there is, that there is no mind. So when you get cremated or\nburied that's it, that's done with, all has ended. The only way you can argue with this view is by developing the\nmeditation that the Buddha achieved under the Bodhi tree. Then you can see the mind for yourself in clear\nawareness - not in some hypnotic trance, not in dullness - but in the clear awareness. This is knowing the mind\nKnowing the Mind.\nWhen you know that mind, when you see it for yourself, one of the results will be an insight that the mind is\nindependent of this body. Independence means that when this body breaks up and dies, when it's cremated or\nwhen it's buried, or however it's destroyed after death, it will not affect the mind. You know this because you see\nthe nature of the mind. That mind which you see will transcend bodily death. The first thing which you will see for\nyourself, the insight which is as clear as the nose on your face, is that there is something more to life than this\nphysical body that we take to be me. Secondly you can recognise that that mind, essentially, is no different than\nthat process of consciousness which is in all beings. Whether it's human beings or animals or even insects, of any\ngender, age or race, you see that that which is in common to all life is this mind, this consciousness, the source of\ndoing.\nOnce you see that, you have much more respect for your fellow beings. Not just respect for your own race, your\nown tribe or your own religion, not just for human beings, but for all beings. It's a wonderfully high-minded idea.\n\"May all beings be happy and well and may we respect all nations, all peoples, even all beings.\" However this is\n202\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhow you achieve that! You truly get compassion only when we see that others are fundamentally just as ourselves.\nIf you think that a cow is completely different from you, that cows don't think like human beings, then it's easy to\neat one. But can you eat your grandmother? She's too much like you. Can you eat an ant? Maybe you'd kill an ant\nbecause you think that ants aren't like you. But if you look carefully at ants, they are no different. In a forest\nmonastery living out in the bush, close to nature, one of the things you become so convinced of is that animals\nhave emotions and , especially, feel pain. You begin to recognise the personality of the animals, of the\nKookaburras,(Australian bird) of the mice, the ants, and the spiders. Each one of those spiders has a mind just\nlike you have. Once you see that you can understand the Buddha's compassion for all beings. You can also\nunderstand how rebirth can occur between all species - not just human beings to human beings, but animals to\nhumans, humans to animals. You can understand also how the mind is the source of all this.”\n- Ajahn Brahmavamso,\nhttps://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:p0B7NPPnQBsJ:https://www.budsas.org/eb\nud/ebmed065.htm+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=sg ”\nHowever, it should be noted that it is not necessary to enter certain states of meditation to shut off the\nfive senses before realizing I AM. As Ramana Maharshi said before, it is not necessary to lose body\nconsciousness to realise Self, although doing so simply intensifies the samadhi or absorption in Self.\n“Right now, as you read this, you exist and you are aware that you exist. You are undoubtedly present and\naware. Before the next thought arises, you are absolutely certain of the fact of your own being, your own\nawareness, your own presence. This awareness is what you are; it is what you always have been. All thoughts,\nperceptions, sensations and feelings appear within or upon that. This awareness does not move, change or shift\nat any time. It is always free and completely untouched. However, it is not a thing or an object that you can see\nor grasp. The mind, being simply thoughts arising in awareness, cannot grasp it or know it or even think about\nit. Yet, as Bob says, you cannot deny the fact of your own being. It is palpably obvious, and yet, from the time we\nwere born, no one has pointed this out. Once it is pointed out it can be grasped or understood very quickly\nbecause it is just a matter of noticing, ‘Oh, that is what I am!’ It is a bright, luminous, empty, presence of\nawareness; it is absolutely radiant, yet without form; it is seemingly intangible, but the most solid fact in your\nexistence; it is effortlessly here right now, forever untouched. Without taking a step, you have arrived; you are\nhome. No practice can reveal this because practices are in time and in the mind. Practices aim at a result, but\nyou (as presence-awareness) are here already, only you don’t recognize it till it is pointed out. Once seen, you\ncan’t lose it, and you don’t have to practice to exist, to be. This is, in essence, what Bob pointed out to me in the\nfirst conversation I had with him.\nOnce I saw this, I felt very clear and free immediately. Later, some thoughts came up, some old personality\npatterns, some old definitions of who I thought myself to be. I seemed to lose the clear understanding of my\nnature as presence-awareness. The next day, I talked to Bob about it. He said, ‘Let’s have a look. Do you exist?\nAre you aware? What is illumining the thought that you have lost it?’ Then I realized that thoughts of suffering\nwere only passing concepts being illumined by the ever-present awareness. I hadn’t lost anything at all. The\nawareness that we are is never obscured! Suffering seems real because we don’t have a clear understanding of\n203\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nour true nature. Instead, we believe the passing thoughts, such as ‘I am no good,’ ‘I am not there yet,’ ‘I am stuck’\nor whatever the thought may be. Eventually we understand that we are not those thoughts. Once our real self is\npointed out, the suffering loses its grip.\nBob pointed out that there is no person here at all. The person that we think we are is an imaginary\nconcept. There are thoughts and feelings and perceptions, but they are not a problem. They just rise and fall like\ndust motes in the light of the presence-awareness that we are.\nThe closest that the mind can come to representing who we are is the thought ‘I am’. But that thought is not\nwho we really are. Whether that thought is there or not, we still exist. We know the thought ‘I am’. That thought\nis the start of the false sense of an individual, a separate ‘I’. Because we didn’t know any better, the mind\nattached other labels to this ‘I’ thought, such as ‘I am good,’ ‘I am bad,’ ‘I have this problem,’ and so on. But\nthose thoughts don’t have anything to do with us, because the very ‘I’ thought itself, the sense of separation, is\nnot actually who we are. Once you see the falseness of the ‘I’ thought, that what we are is not an individual\nperson at all, the identifications and ideas of a lifetime all collapse because they are all based on a false\npremise.” - John Wheeler, https://awakeningclaritynow.com/awakening-to-the-natural-state-guest-\nteaching-by-john-wheeler/\nLikewise, another practitioner by the name of Wayne has described this realization of I AMness:\nhttp://waynedhamma.blogspot.com/2007/02/original-face.html\n“The Original Face\nWhat is the Original Face? It is the face all of us have before our parents gave birth to us. Before we even have the\n6 sense organs of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body & brain to perceive the 6 sense objects of form, sound, smell,\ntaste, feeling & thought. Before we even know good & evil, happiness & suffering, samsara & nirvana. Simply the\npure awareness untainted by all 6 senses - that is the real YOU. That is also me, that is also all sentient beings &\nall Buddhas.\nThis is the Dharma that the 6th Patriarch revealed to his pursuer Hui Ming on Da Yu mountain. By temporarily\nshutting down your 6 sense organs and blocking out the 6 sense objects, by abandoning duality, what is left at\nthat instant is your true nature. Like the still lake without a single ripple, or like the clear blue sky without a single\ncloud; the original face is vast, limitless, formless & completely free. It is not dull nothingness like an unconscious\nperson, but a living, unmoving awareness that pervades all things, yet remaining unaffected by all things. Besides\nthis, there is no other esoteric teachings that the Buddha & the Patriarches can impart to us.\nBut alas, for all of us, after we have picked up a physical body in our mother's womb, we have totally forgotten\nour original face. We started to grasp on to our sense organs, believing that to be our Self, our Ego. This is where\nthe ignorance without a beginning - Avijja takes over. When our sense organs contact the sense objects, we\n204\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ninstinctively allow the objects to enslave the organs, such that craving & aversion develops without an end,\nengulfing the entire universe. From Avijja arises craving & aversion, & from craving & aversion arises endless\nsuffering.\nThus realizing this, the Zen practitioner should, in a single thought understand his or her own mistake, &\nimmediately detach oneself from one's senses & its objects from within. Throwing away all concepts, directly\npenetrate the veil of Avijja & recover your original face. This is the common hope of all Buddhas & Patriarches for\nall sentient beings. Let none of us disappoint them, sadhu.”\nSomeone asked,\n“Is it possible to achieve stream entry with bipolar disorder? I've been recently diagnosed and it has heavily\ndiscouraged me from continuing my practice. Is there any hope? I've yet to learn about anyone with this\ndisorder who has achieved higher insights.”\nKyle Dixon replied,\n“I don’t see why not. Stream entry involves recognition of the true nature of the clear, bright, knowing,\ncognizance of your mind.\nAs your practice progresses you should begin to familiarize with that knowing capacity. Even with bipolar,\nin the height of happiness, the depths of depression, in the intensity of anger, that knowing capacity is\nalways the same, stable, bright, clear. Like the surface of a mirror.\nAnger, sadness, happiness and everything else are like reflections that appear in the surface of the mirror\nbut don’t affect it.\nBe the mirror and don’t get caught up in the reflections.\nThis is not yet stream entry. But it can be a basis for practice that will help you get there.\n…\nIn initial practice, if you treat your knowing conscious clarity of mind as something like the surface of a\nmirror, and the sensory stimuli as reflections that appear on the mirror, anchor your view as being the\nmirror and the view will always be stable no matter what appears.”\nAditya Prasad\nSoh Wei Yu I don't understand this quote. \"Stream entry is X. This is not yet stream entry.\" I think I am\nmisunderstanding which parts describe stream entry and which do not. Is the distinction here the same\nas initial rigpa vs mature rigpa ( = stream entry)? Kyle Dixon · 49m\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nAditya Prasad\nKyle Dixon is saying that recognising the clarity aspect of rigpa is not stream entry but is an important\npreliminary realisation. Realising the empty nature (i.e. anatman) of that clarity of mind is stream entry.\n205\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWarning by Soh: those with serious mental conditions should read this before practicing - Can\nSchizophrenics (and people with other mental illnesses) Practice? -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/12/can-schizophrenics-practice.html\nSomeone asked, \"I often hear people saying that more than a decade has passed between the I AM realization\nand the subsequent ones. It's very often between 10 and 20 years. Does that mean that there's a sort of maturation\nprocess happening very slowly after the first realization? I just wonder if I'm stuck or whether I will make progress\"\nI (Soh) said,\n\"Yes it is common for people to get stuck at I AM for 10-20 years, that's the case for John and many others.\nBut for me, it took me only 8 months from initial I AM realization to anatta. This is because I had pointers\nfrom John. It is possible to progress much faster and avoid dangerous pitfalls and sidetracks when there\nare certain pointers and directions, and I think this blog will quicken your progress.\"\nThe same person realized I AM but was facing this issue,\n\"Though I sort of do feel stuck right now, I have difficulty finding interest in anything, including spiritual matters.\nI find that everything is hollow and without meaning, and for some reason I keep settling into a sort of zombie\nmode where I just do things automatically without really caring. It doesn't feel right, but I don't have the willpower\nor energy needed to get myself out of it.\nI don't know if this sounds familiar, is this also just a stage, or have I gone wrong somewhere along the way?\"\nI (Soh) said,\n\"In my blog the latest post on book recommendations there is a link to the Four Aspects of I Am and in it\none of it is the intensity of luminosity. And I put an article there describing the intensity of luminosity. You\nshould practice that and the joy will come. You will marvel at the aliveness of simple things like the blueness\nof the sky, the colours of flowers and having a simple meal, the tastes. Everything becomes imbued with a\nsense of magnificence and significance and awe, rather than dullness and meaninglessness. If you realized\nThe I Am then you should practice all four aspects and do the Two Types of Nondual Contemplation. That\nis the way to progress.\nIt is also possible to fall into the dark nights in the I Am phase like what happened to Suzanne Segal (or:\nsome form of dissociation, depersonalization or derealization - though these also depends on factors like\n206\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\none’s personal history and childhood traumas). The Four Aspects of I AM and Two Types of Nondual\nContemplation after I AM leading to nondual insight is the remedy\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/dark-night.html \"\nOn the other hand, not all such problems are “spiritual dark nights” but may be related to other personal\nissues, depressions, so on and so forth. In this case, consider seeking expert advice from various fields, not\nlimited to spirituality - it can be in terms of psychology, psychiatry, health, yoga and energy practices, etc.\nAlso relevant are some of the old comments by John Tan in 2006/2007 on dark nights:\n\"Soh Wei Yu\nbadge icon\nThusness:\n25 Jan `07, 2:47PM\n(commenting on some of Suzanne Segal's descriptions) If someone draws a line in the thin air and is able\nto plant a seed into a lay person’s inmost consciousness that “he can’t go beyond this line”, that lay\nperson will feel that the so called ‘imaginary’ boundary is as solid as a physical wall. The way we are\n‘bonded’ to dualistic view of a ‘Self’ is similar. A strong sense of Witnessing Presence without going beyond\nthat \"invisible line\" is not the experience of “no-self” in Buddhism and therefore I would not call her\nexperience an “insight” into no-self. The negative experiences she had seem more like very strong\n‘self/Self’ propensities, it is a form of split, a separation.\nStaying in no-self is to be fully authenticated by all things and as all things. Fear arises because of this lack\nof authentication. She sank too deeply into the 'content'. This is the case of \"dark nights\" where\npropensities rushed into manifestations. Her attempt to reason herself out will not work. Logical\nreasoning cannot break that 'bond' and she just couldn't help reacting to it.\nOne way out is to practice and develop the mental habit of \"dissolving\" every moment before \"content\"\narise. The mental habit of dissolving will become a strength of it own to counter this problem.\nIn true no-self experience, the first aspect is the cognitive mind loses its charm and is replaced with\nintuitive and direct experience. Only the qualities of our nature are experienced (clarity, radiance,\npresence and vitality), nothing about symbols, labels and content. Second, the illusionary view of a \"Self'\non top of manifestation is dissolved; There is complete rest in appearance. Nothing needs be done and\ntherefore there can only be the experience of liberation as that boundary, that separation disappeared.\nNothing is obstructing anything in the experience of no-self.\nEdited by Thusness 25 Jan `07, 11:57PM\n· Reply\n· 2d\n207\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nCharlie Birns\nAuthor\nSoh Wei Yu\nThank you Soh very helpful.\n· Reply\n· 2d\nWrite a reply…\nSoh Wei Yu\nbadge icon\nAlso John Tan experienced dark nights which I didn’t go through or not that I noted:\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2013/12/part-2-of-early-forum-posts-by-thusness_3.html\n“Yes, the thinking mind will mistake the “Eternal Witness” as the ultimate. Smile If without the correct\ninsight and understanding of our emptiness nature, somehow the thinking mind is able to ‘sway’ the\nexperience into thinking ‘No-Self’ as the absence of personality and ego. It is this ‘personality’ or Ego, the\ntotality of all our cultural makeup, that does not exist; but that Reality behind all forms, thinking, mental\nformations and feelings is very real; it is the ultimate background of all existence. This is false and in\nBuddhism, this is the “big Self” that should be eliminated through the experience of non-duality (anatta).\nOur pristine nature is not what the linear mode of reasoning can understanding. However “seeing in raw”\ndoes not necessarily lead to the experience of true non-duality; the experience of “AMness” is also a very\ncrucial condition. Together with the realization of 'the sense of self is not the doer of action' , then the\nconditions are ready. They are all part of the progress.\nThe dark nights described by Dharma Dan are very real for many reasons but then it still depends on\none’s conditions. I experienced most of the problems. It took me more than 9 months to overcome them.\nThis self-claim Arahat is truly experience, he has all my respects! All is still due to the propensities of the\n“Self’, they are working at a very subtle level. It is not detectable at the conscious level and it is for this that\nI must commend you for not being misled by the non-dual experience. You are mindful that the karmic\npatterns still hover around. This is very important. Deeper insight must come from understanding how\nconsciousness works. It is not at the conscious level alone. So deep are these propensities then even with\nthe non-dual experience that is so clear and vivid, the propensities still persist and manifest from\nmoment to moment. They do not go even after death. It is these patterns that we must be aware. Once\nrooted, they cannot be easily overcome. The antidote is to habituate the non-dual insight deep down into\nour consciousness. Do not push yourself too hard but make more regular meditations. It is not easy to\nsubmerge entirely into the luminous-bliss of arising and dissolving from moment to moment in day to\nday working life. Though you can’t completely fuse the experience into daily working life, you will still be\nauthenticated.\n208\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSaw some of your posts in other forums. Not many will understand your experience even in the mystic\ncircle, just let it be. Happy Journey. :)\" – John Tan, 2006\nAnother person said, \"I’m curious what was the drive for you to look any deeper? I seem to be content where I\nam..and it seems to be that a certain level of discontentment would need to be present in order to want to go\nfurther. What are your thoughts?\"\nI (Soh) replied, \"Once the I AM is realized, I'm guided by the taste of a pure, original, primordial, non-\nconceptual and non-dual luminous state of existence.\nTo bring it into natural, effortless, full-blown spontaneous perfection and intensity in all experience,\nmanifestation, activities, the way I found out (thankfully not very long process due to pointers by John) is\nthrough deepening of insights into nondual, anatta and emptiness.\"\n\"All those are about I AM and the rank of apparent within the real. (See: Five Ranks of Tozan\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html) After the initial\nrealization, I AM becomes stagnant water as one becomes fixed on a dead Absolute. This is where Zen\nMaster Hakuin criticised about an evil spirit watching over the corpse and being stuck in stagnant waters.\nAnatta realisation is different, it sees through the view that an ultimate background exists and everything\n- the myriad forms are the bright radiance of buddha nature, the real in the apparent\" - Soh, 2020\n“Awareness aware of itself soon becomes dead...lol. The measure of one's depth is in the ineffability and\nmarvelous manifestation in activity. Anatta and emptiness cannot be dead.” – John Tan, 2013\n\"The sense of 'Self' must dissolve in all entry and exit points. In the first stage of dissolving, the dissolving\nof 'Self' relates only to the thought realm. The entry is at the mind level. The experience is the 'AMness'.\nHaving such experience, a practitioner might be overwhelmed by the transcendental experience,\nattached to it and mistaken it as the purest stage of consciousness, not realizing that it is only a state of\n'no-self' relating to the thought realm.\" - John Tan, decade+ ago\n“The direct realization of Mind is formless, soundless, smell-less, odourless, etc. But later on it is realised\nthat forms, smells, odours, are Mind, are Presence, Luminosity. Without deeper realisation, one just\nstagnates in the I AM level and get fixated on the formless, etc. That is Thusness Stage 1.\nThe I-I or I AM is later realised to be simply one aspect or 'sense gate' or 'door' of pristine consciousness.\nIt is later seen to be not any more special or ultimate than a color, a sound, a sensation, a smell, a touch, a\nthought, all of which reveals its vibrant aliveness and luminosity. The same taste of I AM is now extended\n209\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nto all senses. Right now you don't feel that, you only authenticated the luminosity of the Mind/thought\ndoor. So your emphasis is on the formless, odourless, and so on. After anatta it is different, everything is\nof the same luminous, empty taste.\nAnd the 'I AM' of the mind door is not any more different than any other sense door, it is only different in\nthat it is a 'different' manifestation of differing conditions just like a sound is different from a sight, a\nsmell is different from a touch. Sure, the Mind door is odourless, but that's not any different from saying\nthe vision door is odourless and the sound door is sensationless. It doesn't imply some sort of hierarchy\nor ultimacy of one mode of knowingness over another. They are simply different sense gates but equally\nluminous and empty, equally Buddha-nature.” – Soh, 2020\n\"When consciousness experiences the pure sense of “I AM”, overwhelmed by the transcendental\nthoughtless moment of Beingness, consciousness clings to that experience as its purest identity. By doing\nso, it subtly creates a ‘watcher’ and fails to see that the ‘Pure Sense of Existence’ is nothing but an aspect of\npure consciousness relating to the thought realm. This in turn serves as the karmic condition that prevents\nthe experience of pure consciousness that arises from other sense-objects. Extending it to the other senses,\nthere is hearing without a hearer and seeing without a seer -- the experience of Pure Sound-Consciousness\nis radically different from Pure Sight-Consciousness. Sincerely, if we are able to give up ‘I’ and replace it with\n“Emptiness Nature”, Consciousness is experienced as non-local. There isn't a state that is purer than the\nother. All is just One Taste, the manifold of Presence.\nThe ‘who’, ‘where’ and ‘when’, the ‘I’, ‘here’ and ‘now’ must ultimately give way to the experience of total\ntransparency. Do not fall back to a source, just the manifestation is sufficient. This will become so clear that\ntotal transparency is experienced. When total transparency is stabilized, transcendental body is\nexperienced and dharmakaya is seen everywhere. This is the samadhi bliss of Bodhisattva. This is the\nfruition of practice.\" – John Tan, 2006, 3) Buddha Nature is NOT \"I Am\"\n\"LongChen has experienced the pure Presence to a certain level. :) LongChen [Sim Pern Chong] will not\neasily summit himself/herself to a master. He has reached a certain level of attainment.\nDo not belittle what he [Sim Pern Chong] experiences. Pure sense of existence is most sacred. It is difficult\nto develop penetrating insight into the different layers of consciousness. To go beyond the \"I AM\" is rare. :)\nIt's a lonely journey. I told you it will be a struggle for him. Because he will not easily submit himself now\nto a master. :)\nThe True Buddha Nature is the Pure Presence, however when the mind attempts to grasp its essence after\nits initial experience, it creatively creates the \"I AM\". An Entity having all the properties of, yet still stubbornly\nattached to the \"I'. It is the tricks of the monkey mind’s unwillingness to let go yet trying to recapture the\nPure Presence experience. As such when it turns inwards to break layer by layer of its own boundaries, it\nwill have all these hurdles to clear.\n210\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIt is too subtle to differentiate the I AM from Thusness. :) Eliminate the I from \"I AM\", AMness has no\nmeaning without \"I\".

Anyway it will take many years. :)\" - John Tan, 2004\n“In lesser than a year, he [Sim Pern Chong] will break through [into anatta]. But he must extend it to the\nrest of the 5 senses, and experience it in clarity. :)” – Accurate prediction by John Tan, January 2006\nAfter the maturity of anatta insight and twofold emptiness (which will be discussed later in this document),\neventually there is effortless, ongoing and intense experience of \"everything as Self\", \"As in that experience\nof I AM powerfully present at this moment\", \"As if like Awareness clear and open like space, without\nmeditation yet powerfully present and non-dual. Where the 4 Aspects of I AM are fully experienced in this\nmoment. This experience will become more and more powerful later yet effortless and uncontrived. How\nso? If it is not correct insights and practice, how is it possible for such complete and total experience of\neffortless and uncontrived Presence be possible?\". \"Indeed and this is being authenticated by the\nimmediate moment of experience. How could there be doubt about it. The last trace of Presence must be\nreleased with seeing through the emptiness nature of whatever arises. After maturing and integrating your\ninsights into practice, there must be no effort and action.... The entire whole is doing the work and arises\nas this vivid moment of shimmering appearance, this has always been what we always called Presence.\"\n\"Yes and you should in all moment of 6 entries and exits experience all coming together for this moment\nto arise....this will dissolve all senses of holdings and will lead you effortless and maha experience of\nsuchness effortlessly\", \"interpenetration, open, boundless, effortless and uncontrived.\" (John, 2012)\n“So this experience is not a normal experience, correct? I mean, within the probably 15 years of my life or\n17 years of my life, my first... when I was 17, when you first experienced that, wah, what is that? So, it is\nsomething different, it is non conceptual, it is non dual, and all these. But it is very difficult to get back the\nexperience. Very, very difficult, unless you're in when you're in meditation, because you reject the relative,\nthe appearances. So, it is, although they may say no, no, it is always with me, because it's Self, correct? But\nyou don't actually get back the authentication, just pure sense of existence, just me, because you reject\nthe rest of that appearances, but you do not know during that time. Only after anatta, then you realize\nthat this, when you when you hear sound without the background, that experience is exactly the same,\nthe taste is exactly the same as the presence. The I AM Presence. So, only after anatta, when the\nbackground is gone, then you realize eh, this has the exact same taste as the I AM experience. When you\nare not hearing, you are just in the vivid appearances, the obvious appearances now, correct. That\nexperience is also the I AM experience. When you are even now feeling your sensation without the sense\nof self directly. That experience is exactly the same as I AM taste. It is nondual. Then you realize, I call,\nactually, everything is Mind. Correct? Everything. So, so before that, there is an ultimate Self, a\nbackground, and you reject all those transient appearances. After that, that background is gone, you\nknow? And then you are just all these appearances.\nWilliam Lam: You are the appearance? You are the sound? You are the…\n211\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nJohn Tan: Yes. So, so, that is an experience. That is an experience. So after that, you realize something.\nWhat did you realise? You realise all along it is the what, that is obscuring you. So… in a person, for a\nperson that is in I AM experience, the pure presence experience, they will always have a dream. They will\nsay that I hope I can 24 by 7 always in that state, correct? So when I was young, 17. But then after 10 years\nyou are still thinking. Then after 20 years, you say how come I need to always meditate? You always find\ntime to meditate, maybe I don't study also meditate, you give me a cave last time I will just meditate\ninside.\nSo, the the thing that you always dream that you can one day be pure consciousness, just as pure\nconsciousness, live as pure consciousness, but you never get it. And even if you meditate, occasionally\nprobably you can have that oceanic experience. Only when you after anatta, when that self behind is\ngone, you are not 24 by 7, maybe most of your day, waking state, not so much of 24 by 7, you dream that\ntime still very karmic depending on what you engage, doing business, all these. (John mimics dreaming)\nHow come ah, the business…\nSo, so, in normal waking state, you are effortless. Probably that is the, during I AM phase, what you think\nyou are going to achieve, you achieve after the insight of anatta. So you become clear, you are probably in\nthe right path. But there are further insights you have to go through. When you try to penetrate the… one\nof them is, I feel that I become very physical. I am just narrating, going through my experience. Maybe\nthat time… because you experience the relative, the appearances directly. So everything becomes very\nphysical. So that is how you come to understand the meaning, how concepts actually affect you. Then\nwhat exactly is physical? How does the idea of physical come about, correct? That time I still do not know\nabout emptiness, and all these kind of things, to me it is not so important.\nSo, I start going into what exactly is physical, what exactly is being physical? Sensation. But why is\nsensation known as physical, and what is being physical? How did I get the idea of being physical? So, I\nbegan to enquire into this thing. That, eh, actually on top of that, there is still further things to\ndeconstruct, that is the meaning… that, just like self, I’m attached to the meaning of self, and you create a\nconstruct, it becomes a reification. Same thing, physicality also. So, you deconstruct the concepts\nsurrounding physicality. Correct? So, when you deconstruct that, then I began to realize that all along, we\ntry to understand, even after the experience of let’s say, anatta and all these… when we analyze, and\nwhen we think and try to understand something, we are using existing scientific concepts, logic, common\nday to day logic and all these to understand something. And it is always excluding consciousness. Even if\nyou experience, you can lead a spiritual path you know, but when you think and analyze something,\nsomehow you always exclude consciousness from the equation of understanding something. Your\nconcept is always very materialistic. We always exclude consciousness from the whole equation.” - ATR\nMeeting 28 October 2020 - Google Docs\n“[21:45] <^john^> true quality of meditation comes when there is this sudden awareness of the 'I'. A mere\nsense of pure existence. The Isness that Merely IS without any sense of thought. And this is what one\nshould treasure most. :) But when the experience is mixed with the content of thought, it becomes pretty\nconfusing. Because thought cannot touch its realm. When one tries to capture this experience out of his\nmeditative state, he will suffer great pain.\n[21:53] <^john^> what i can tell you is that Buddhism has profound insight into the nature of 'I'. And it is\ntrue about whatever that is taught. :)\n212\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n[21:54] <^john^> Pure awareness is the only peace there is.\n[21:55] AEN: the nature if \"i\" is also non-dualistic. and any concept and perspective and view of the \"i\" is\nnaturally delusioned. rite?\n[21:56] <^john^> yes but knowing must not come from thinking. It must come from a direct perception.\nBefore entering into buddhism, I thought it is not possible to recapture this state of non-dual. But\nconstant practice will proof this wrong. In fact we can, by vipassana meditation.” – John Tan, 2004\n\"There is nothing wrong with the Isness experienced as “I AM” except that it is skewed towards the\n‘thought’ realm. The cognitive mind is overwhelmed by the transcendental experience and wants to\nmonopolize the entirety of Presence. As such the purity is distorted. Full and equal authentication of\nIsness as experienced in “I AM” must also be fully experienced in all appearance and to all moments of\nmanifestation. When the ‘center’ is dissolved, no preference can be made between “Amness” and\nAppearances”, nothing can be more clear, All is it!\" - John Tan to JonLS [Din Robinson], 2007\n\"Isness that arises from “I AM” is a sensation of not wanting to add or subtract anything from present\nmoment but still with a strong sense of object and subject split intact. It is the act of letting things be as it\nis. However as the experience has not dissolved the subject-object split, there is still a clear separation of\n“I AM” and object and that already is not as it is. For in truth reality is always non-dual so when there is a\nsplit, it is already not \"as it is\".\" - John Tan, 2007\nJohn Tan's reply on something Malcolm wrote in 2020:\n“This is like what I tell you and essentially emphasizing 明心非见性. 先明心, 后见性. (Soh: Apprehending\nMind is not seeing [its] Nature. First apprehend Mind, later realise [its] Nature).\nFirst is directly authenticating mind/consciousness 明心 (Soh: Apprehending Mind). There is the direct\npath like zen sudden enlightenment of one's original mind or mahamudra or dzogchen direct\nintroduction of rigpa or even self enquiry of advaita -- the direct, immediate, perception of\n\"consciousness\" without intermediaries. They are the same.\nHowever that is not realization of emptiness. Realization of emptiness is 见性 (Soh: Seeing Nature). Imo\nthere is direct path to 明心 (Soh: Apprehending Mind) but I have not seen any direct path to 见性 (Soh:\nSeeing Nature) yet. If you go through the depth and nuances of our mental constructs, you will\nunderstand how deep and subtle the blind spots are.\nTherefore emptiness or 空性 (Soh: Empty Nature) is the main difference between buddhism and other\nreligions. Although anatta is the direct experiential taste of emptiness, there is still a difference between\nbuddhist's anatta and selflessness of other religions -- whether it is anatta by experiential taste of the\ndissolution of self alone or the experiential taste is triggered by wisdom of emptiness.\nThe former focused on selflessness and whole path of practice is all about doing away with self whereas\nthe latter is about living in the wisdom of emptiness and applying that insight and wisdom of emptiness\nto all phenomena.\n213\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAs for emptiness there is the fine line of seeing through inherentness of Tsongkhapa and there is the\nemptiness free from extremes by Gorampa. Both are equally profound so do not talk nonsense and\nengaged in profane speech as in terms of result, ultimately they are the same (imo).”\nDalai Lama - \"Nature - there are many different levels. Conventional level, one nature. There are also, you\nsee, different levels. Then, ultimate level, ultimate reality... so simply realise the Clarity of the Mind, that is\nthe conventional level. That is common with Hindus, like that. So we have to know these different\nlevels....\" - Dalai Lama on Anatta and Emptiness of Buddha Nature in New Book\nSomeone asked, \"I think I understand. So all of these aspects [Four Aspects of I AM] can be experienced without\nthe realization of \"I Am\"? Does the realization of \"I Am\" mean all of these aspects are actualized all at once, but\njust not fully? What is stream-entry in Buddhism pointing to? Is that an \"I am\" realization, or just an aspect of \"I\nam\"?\"\nSoh: \"No, the four aspects do not come simultaneously with I AM realization. The aspect of impersonality\n(like being lived by a cosmic and impersonal Life/Spirit/Intelligence/God) is experienced for some before I\nAM realization, and for me it is experienced a few months after the I AM realization. They complement each\nother and a mature state of I AM will include impersonality.\nSome Indian Advaita masters distinguish 'Self-Realization' from 'God-Realization', with the latter being a\nmore advanced phase. God-Realization is the Impersonality aspect being experienced after initial I AM\nrealization.\nTo me, the scriptural version (as opposed to other versions like MCTB, which is rather defined as the 4th\npath) of stream entry requires realization of anatta, a thorough seeing through of self view. Thusness Stage\n5. Otherwise it cannot be called the end of self view. All stages before Thusness Stage 5 still does not\novercome the false view of self and extreme views like eternalism thoroughly, therefore fall into various\nnon-Buddhist views.\nI AM is absolutely *not* Buddhist stream entry. It is also not found in some maps like MCTB, nor does it\nfeature as a stage of enlightenment in the earliest Buddhist teachings, although it is very likely that Buddha\nwent through that phase while studying under two Samkhya meditation teachers but that’s another story.\"\n(Also related: [insight] [buddhism] A reconsideration of the meaning of \"Stream-Entry\" considering the data\npoints of both pragmatic Dharma and traditional Buddhism , Definition of First Bhumi)\nSomeone said, \"It's interesting, whenever I practice \"I am,\" I feel an *increased\" sense of localization behind the\neyes, not a move toward nonduality. I am doing other practices (such as the \"sheer miracle of experience\") to\ndeepen nondual recognition. This is despite the fact that Soh would diagnose me as not having stabilized \"I AM\"\nrealization.\"\n214\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSoh replied, \"There are different levels of I AM. At a deeper level, it reveals its nonlocalised, diffused, infinite\nand all pervading aspect\nAlso at the I AM, you feel like the luminous void background containing all sceneries.

I’m reaching that thoughtless state and\nwhen I inquire “Who’s aware of this experience?” there’s no change. Is just this boundless space where\nthere’s just awareness.\nI read your journal and you describe being in a blank and asking “Who is aware of this experience?” and\nhaving a experience of being.\nI wouldn’t say that the “place” I dwell it’s blank because it is very clear. And there’s a feeling of just being\nThat. But at the same time I don’t feel anything really different in my perception of reality (beyond few\nthoughts and higher space awareness)\nAm I missing something?\n215\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThank you\nSoh replied:\nWhat you experience is good. Continue inquiring.\nSession Start: Sunday, 25 October, 2009\n(2:07 AM) AEN: just now it occurred to me that the places i've been are hazy like a dream, they come and\ngo.... then i realised my thoughts also are like a dream, they come and go... when i dropped that theres\nonly my own existence and presence left which is real and not hazy at all and doesnt come and go\n(2:34 AM) AEN: then for a short while i was only aware of my own existence... until i got distracted :P\n(5:16 AM) Thusness: not bad... That is the beginning phase of I AM.\n(5:19 AM) Thusness: first drop your thoughts, drop all sort of mental chattering, drop everything, don't\nthink of non-dual.

This is the first phase.\n(5:19 AM) AEN: icic..\n(5:20 AM) Thusness: then you will realize what existence is.\nMr. C:\nThat’s good to hear. I’ll keep working\nYou said to keep inquiring, but this advice from Jon about dropping everything and allowing to be filled\nwith sense of existence, to do this I need to stop the Inquiry right?\nTo clarify, this state of Being is different from the blank state. If it is the blank state I should keep inquiring\nbut if it is the Being (sense of existence) should I let go of Inquiring?\nSoh replied:\ndoesnt mean stop inquiry\ni still inquired all the way to February 2010 when I realized I AM\ninquiry is supposed to lead to the non-conceptual taste and realization of Existence, so its non\ncontradictory\nas long as there is slightest doubt what Existence is then continue inquiry. if you are just resting as\nExistence then just go into it\nMr. C:\n216\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nYeah my question is during practice.

That is, he did not say ‘ask to whom’ or ‘ask who am I’ but ‘investigate to\nwhom’ and ‘investigate who am I’, as he wrote in the following portion of the sixth paragraph of Nāṉ Ār?:\nபிற வெண் ணங்க வெழுந்தா லெற்றறப் பூரத் ்தி பண் ணுெதற்கு எத்தனியாமல் அறெ யாருக்\nகுண் டாயின என்று விசாரிக்க வெண் டும். எதத் றன எண் ணங்க வெழினு வமன்ன?\nஜாக்கிரறதயாய் ஒெ்வொ வரண் ணமும் கிெம்பும்வபாவத இது யாருக்குண் டாயிற்று என்று\nவிசாரித்தால் எனக்வகன்று வதான்றும். நானார ்என்று விசாரிதத் ால் மனம் தன்\nபிறப்பிடத்திற்குத ்திரும்பிவிடும்; எழுந்த வெண் ணமு மடங்கிவிடும். இப்படிப் பழகப் பழக\nமனத்திற்குத் தன் பிறப்பிடத்திற் றங்கி நிற்கும் சக்தி யதிகரிக்கின்றது.\npiṟa v-eṇṇaṅgaḷ eṙundāl avaṯṟai-p pūrtti paṇṇuvadaṟku ettaṉiyāmal avai yārukku uṇḍāyiṉa eṉḏṟu vicārikka\nvēṇḍum. ettaṉai eṇṇaṅgaḷ eṙiṉum eṉṉa? jāggirataiyāy ovvōr eṇṇamum kiḷambum-pōdē idu yārukku\nuṇḍāyiṯṟu eṉḏṟu vicārittāl eṉakkeṉḏṟu tōṉḏṟum. nāṉ-ār eṉḏṟu vicārittāl maṉam taṉ piṟappiḍattiṟku-t tirumbi-\nviḍum; eṙunda v-eṇṇamum aḍaṅgi-viḍum. ippaḍi-p paṙaga-p paṙaga maṉattiṟku-t taṉ piṟappiḍattil taṅgi\nniṟgum śakti y-adhikarikkiṉḏṟadu.\nIf other thoughts rise, without trying to complete them it is necessary to investigate to whom they have\noccurred. However many thoughts rise, what [does it matter]? Vigilantly, as soon as each thought\n217\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nappears, if one investigates to whom it has occurred, it will be clear: to me. If one investigates who am I\n[by vigilantly attending to oneself, the ‘me’ to whom everything else appears], the mind will return to its\nbirthplace [namely oneself, the source from which it arose]; [and since one thereby refrains from\nattending to it] the thought that had risen will also cease. When one practises and practises in this\nmanner, for the mind the power to stand firmly established in its birthplace increases.\nThe verb he used here that I have translated as ‘investigate’ is விசாரி (vicāri), which in some contexts can\nmean enquire in the sense of ask, but in this context means enquire only in the sense of investigate.\nAsking questions is a mental activity, because it entails directing our attention away from ourself towards\na question, which is a thought and hence other than ourself, so as long as we are asking questions we are\nstill floating on the surface of the mind by attending to things other than ourself, whereas investigating\nourself means being keenly self-attentive, which causes the mind to sink deep within and thereby return\nto its ‘birthplace’, the source from which it had risen, namely our real nature (ātma-svarūpa), which is our\nfundamental and ever-shining awareness of our own existence, ‘I am’.\nTherefore what Bhagavan is pointing out in this passage is the direction in which we should send our\nattention. Instead of allowing our attention to go out following whatever thoughts may arise, we should\nturn it back towards ourself, the one to whom all thoughts appear. ‘To whom?’ is not intended to be a\nquestion that we should ask ourself but is a very powerful pointer indicating where we should direct our\nattention. Asking the question ‘to whom?’ may sometimes be an aid if it helps to remind us to turn our\nattention back towards ourself, but self-investigation (ātma-vicāra) is not merely asking such questions\nbut only fixing our attention on ourself alone.\nAnother point worth noting here is that what Bhagavan means by ‘thought’ is anything other than our\nfundamental awareness ‘I am’, so it includes all perceptions, memories, feelings, ideas and other mental\nimpressions of any kind whatsoever. As he says in the fourth paragraph of Nāṉ Ār?, ‘நிறனவுகறெத்\nதவிரத் ்து ஜகவமன்வறார ்வபாருெ் அன்னியமா யில்றல’ (niṉaivugaḷai-t tavirttu jagam eṉḏṟu ōr\nporuḷ aṉṉiyam-āy illai), ‘Excluding thoughts, there is not separately any such thing as world’, and in the\nfourteenth paragraph, ‘ஜக வமன்பது நிறனவெ’ (jagam eṉbadu niṉaivē), ‘What is called the world is\nonly thought’, so when he says here ‘பிற வெண் ணங்க வெழுந்தால்’ (piṟa v-eṇṇaṅgaḷ eṙundāl), ‘If other\nthoughts rise’, or ‘ஒெ்வொ வரண் ணமும் கிெம்பும்வபாவத’ (ovvōr eṇṇamum kiḷambum-pōdē), ‘As\nsoon as each thought appears’, he means that if or as soon as anything other than ourself appears in our\nawareness, we should turn our attention back towards ourself, the one to whom all such things appear.\n6. If we are vigilantly self-attentive, as we should try to be, we will thereby ward off both thoughts and\nsleep, but when we are tired we are naturally less vigilant, so we may then fall asleep as a result of our\ntrying to be self-attentive\nYou ask, ‘Should I keep doing Self-Enquiry all day for hours in seated position? Should I continue the\nenquiry in bed as well before sleep? Or should I stop the enquiry from time to time to give some rest to\n218\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nthe body?’ Firstly, self-investigation has nothing to do with the body, so we can practise it whether the\nbody is lying, sitting, standing, walking or doing anything else. For the same reason, we do not have to\nstop being self-attentive in order to give some rest to the body, because being self-attentive cannot strain\nthe body in any way. In fact, when the body and mind are resting is a very favourable condition for us to\nbe self-attentive.\nRegarding your question about continuing the practice in bed before sleep, that is also good, but since we\nare generally very tired at that time, we usually subside into sleep soon after trying to be self-attentive.\nThere is no harm in that, because when we need to sleep we should sleep. There is no time and no\ncircumstance that is not suitable for us to be self-attentive, so we should try to be self-attentive as much\nas possible whatever the time or circumstances may be, but we should not try to deprive ourself of\nhowever much sleep we may need.\nIf we are vigilantly self-attentive, as we should try to be, we will thereby ward off both thoughts and sleep,\nbut when we are tired we are naturally less vigilant, so we may then fall asleep as a result of our trying to\nbe self-attentive. As Sadhu Om often used to say, when we are sleepy we should sleep, because when we\nwake up again we will be fresh, and we should then make use of that freshness by trying to be vigilantly\nself-attentive.\nI do not know whether anything I have written here is of any use to you, but I hope some of it at least may\nhelp to point you in the right direction.\n7. What the word ‘I’ essentially refers to is only what is aware, so if we are just being aware of what is\naware, we are thereby meditating on ‘I’\nIn reply to my first reply (which I adapted as the previous six sections) my friend wrote again about how\nhe was trying to practise self-enquiry and the problems he was facing, in reply to which I wrote:\nWhen you say ‘The practice of Self-Enquiry, especially in seated position (just being aware of awareness\nitself, not meditating in any object or form etc, simply just being, not even “I” in the “I am”) boosted my\nkundalini’, it is not clear to me what you are actually practising, because you say you are ‘just being aware\nof awareness itself’ but then seem to say that you are not meditating even on ‘I’. Meditating on ‘I’ means\nattending only to yourself, or in other words, just being self-attentive, so if you are not meditating on ‘I’,\nwhat do you mean by saying that you are ‘just being aware of awareness itself’?\nIn this context ‘awareness’ means what is aware, and what is aware is always aware of itself as ‘I’, so what\nthe word ‘I’ essentially refers to is only what is aware. Therefore if you are not meditating on ‘I’, what is the\n‘awareness’ that you are being aware of? Unfortunately ‘awareness’ is a potentially ambiguous term,\nbecause it could be taken to mean awareness in the sense of awareness of objects or phenomena, so\n219\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nwhen you are ‘just being aware of awareness itself’, are you just being aware of what is aware, namely\nyourself, or are you being aware of your awareness of objects or phenomena?\nIf you are being aware only of what is aware, namely yourself, then you are meditating on ‘I’. That is, what\nyou are meditating on is not the word ‘I’, but what the word ‘I’ refers to, namely yourself, who are what is\naware. If you are not meditating on what the word ‘I’ refers to, then whatever ‘awareness’ you are being\naware of is something other than what is aware.\nThis is why Bhagavan gave us the powerful pointer ‘to whom’, about which I wrote in my previous reply. If\nwe understand this pointer correctly, it is directing our attention back towards ourself, the one to whom\nall other things appear. In other words, it is pointing our attention back to what is aware, away from\nwhatever we were hitherto aware of.\nIf you are aware of any phenomenon, such as the boosting of your kuṇḍalinī, your attention has been\ndiverted away from yourself, so you need to turn it back to yourself, the one to whom all phenomena\nappear. If you turn your attention back to yourself and hold firmly to yourself (that is, if you just remain\nfirmly self-attentive), whatever phenomena may have appeared will thereby disappear, because no\nphenomenon can appear or remain in your awareness unless you attend to it at least to a certain extent.\n8. No matter what may distract us or seem a problem to us, let us not be concerned about them but just\npatiently and persistently continue trying to be self-attentive, unmindful of everything else\nRegarding the boosting of your kuṇḍalinī you say, ‘By boosting I mean that I feel an energy in the spine\npassing through the chakras’, but the energy, the spine, the cakras and the energy’s movement are all\nobjects or phenomena, so you should ignore all such things by trying to be keenly self-attentive. However\nmuch such things appear, they need not concern you. To whom do they appear? Only to you, so you\nshould just persevere in trying to attend only to yourself.\nWhatever may appear or disappear is other than ourself, so it should not interest or concern us. Such\nthings distract us and become a problem for us only to the extent that we take interest in them or are\nconcerned about them. Why should we be concerned about them? Our only concern should be to\ninvestigate and know what we ourself are. If we are not interested in or concerned about anything else,\nwe will not attend to them, and hence they will not be a problem.\nIf we find ourself being concerned about such things and therefore distracted by them, that is due to the\nstrength of our viṣaya-vāsanās, and the most effective means to weaken our viṣaya-vāsanās and thereby\nwean our mind off its interest in all other things is just to persevere in this simple practice of being self-\nattentive. Therefore, no matter what may distract us or seem a problem to us, let us not be concerned\nabout them but just patiently and persistently continue trying to be self-attentive, unmindful of\neverything else.\n220\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhttps://happinessofbeing.blogspot.com/2021/05/can-self-investigation-boost-mind-or.html\n....\nMr C: Yeah, it seems that I was still inquiring even when I was aware of Being. That's why I was feeling\nstuck.\nI will now Inquire only there's something othar than \"myself\" appearing.\nThis pointer \"To whom?\" is really good. Short and direct.\nThank you!\nHey Soh, just wanna say that those last instructions made a huge difference.\nPractice now is really sharp and asking “To whom?” has been the perfect inquiry to return to Being.\nOutside formal practice the sense of self is expanding everywhere even though there was no “eureka”\nmoment yet. There’s a feel of awareness being 360 degrees specially behind my head and shoulders.\nSoh: (thumbs up)\nTold someone something similar today:\n[5:19 PM, 8/4/2021] Mr. W: Trying to find the unfindable \"me\"...\n\"Where\" the hell is this \"awareness\" if it is not inside my head?\n[7:03 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: If you are trying to locate it in your field of experience thats like looking in\nthe display for the screen. Looking for the experiencer in the experience. I AM realization is the realization\nof You, so you don’t look for You outside anywhere\n[7:03 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Find out to whom does head and everything appear to/in\n[7:05 PM, 8/4/2021] Mr. W: I suppose that's being aware of being aware?\n[7:06 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: You can say so. Turn your attention around to realize what\nYou/Awareness is\n[7:11 PM, 8/4/2021] Mr. W: Yah, will focus on this\n[7:11 PM, 8/4/2021] Mr. W: As in one of your recent comments... it's not an intellectual questioning yah?\n221\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n[7:24 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: You need to investigate but investigation is not verbally repeating a\nquestion\n[7:24 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Investigate means you distinguish what is you and what is not you\n[7:25 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Then you turn away from the not you to realise you\n[7:25 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: All these is done in a non verbal manner\n[7:35 PM, 8/4/2021] Mr. W: I know the answer is the one that is aware of experience. But what is missing?\n[8:06 PM, 8/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Realization comes with total certainty and direct taste\n[8:25 PM, 8/4/2021] Mr. W: Okay, keep trying. Hope the Eureka moment happens sooner rather than\nlater.\n…\nAs Jayson pointed out, with any of these perceptions, experiences you can simply inquire “who is the one\nperceiving?” Then look “there.” Also can just notice the vantage FROM which you seem to be perceiving\neach experience and rest there. Often this comes with a sort of stepwise inward moving experience but\nhold that description loosely. When you come to a truly contentless experience there will be nothing to do\nno where specific to look and an alertness to any arising thought or perception which will be immediately\ndiscounted as such. Once this is clear there’s not a lot more to do but stay with it, stay alert but don’t\nstrain. There are a few expected “reactions” at this point one being physiologic fear/terror. If it comes and\nyou remain in thoughtless clarity it will pass. Practice this way and let me know what you find. I’ve\nworked with a handful of people in exactly the way you are practicing in last couple weeks who all broke\nthrough. You got this. But you gotta go where you no longer know where you are\n- Angelo Dilullo\nLabels: I AMness, Self Enquiry 0 comments | |\nComplementary Practices to Self-Enquiry\nRamana Maharshi teaches that the most direct path to self-realization is self-enquiry. That is what Ramana\nwould teach first. However if the seeker says he/she has trouble inquiring properly, Ramana may advice on\nother methods like controlling the breath. Other secondary practices are useful, such as breath control, if\none is unable to get the mind to a relatively silent stable state for effective inquiry. A wandering monkey\nmind (a chattery mind) is not able to effectively inquire into what you truly are prior to thinking. However\none must come back to inquiry at the end.\nAlso, someone asked Nisargadatta, “Q: In the beginning we may have to pray and meditate for some time\nbefore we are ready for self-inquiry.\n222\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nM: If you believe so, go on. To me, all delay is a waste of time. You can skip all the preparation and go\ndirectly for the ultimate search within. Of all the Yogas it is the simplest and the shortest.”\n“Jun 20\nTaste of I AMness and Integration with the Somatic\n[3:03 PM, 6/20/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Albert Hong\nAlbert Hong I'm not sure if OP got his answer yet. Probably, but I can add another opinion to the mix. To\nget access to AMness or Beingness one has to distinguish the vital energy from the body. Then the\nessence of that vital energy, which is the life force or your sense of being alive is your BeingNess.\nSo you can think of it this way. You have a body. You also breath air or prana. When the air accumulates\nwithin you, due to spiritual practice. Which is basically coarse body identification becoming more subtle.\nThen from that arises the sense of Being. It is the most subtle substance that is arisen from your body,\ndue to you eating food.\nI'm not sure what your \"practice\" is. But if you do anything body based or breath based then naturally you\nwill understand what is meant by inner vitality. An inner sense of aliveness or well being or just having\nmore energy due to spiritual practice.\nIf you give you attention to that life energy then it will naturally become more subtle until your whole\nsense of a body is just bliss and knowingness.\nthen Amness becomes the very most subtle substance of everything. but it all begins with coarse to\nsubtle to AMness.\nA large part of isolating the sense of YOYou ARE is due to interacting with being abiding in such state.\nThen it becomes clear what that taste or flavor is. Then it becomes a process of distinguishing that from\ncoarse body identification, which is nothing but muscular tensions. Those tensions then when recognized\nas the YOYou ARE become bliss, become nothing but YOYou ARE.\nSo fundamentally the quickest way to recognize that is to get into the physical presence of a teacher.\nThen the work is isolating it apart from all the possible experiences and in particular the different bodies\nfrom coarse to subtle. Then reintergrating that sense into all the bodies again.\nThe emphasis is also on somatic practices. You don't just live with your thinking mind. You live as a\nbody. There are modalities of knowing that mostly are not spoken in spirituality due to the heavy\nemphasis on intellectualism.\nDevotion for instance is a great access point to realize AMness. When you truly love something without\nboundaries, without desire then the aliveness or soul essence of what you love shines forth.\n223\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSo if Who am I doesn't work just note that there are many, many ways.\n[3:58 PM, 6/20/2020] John Tan: This is very good.

You are looking at just AMness. But\nAlbert put it quite well for both, total exertion as well as this comment. Did you get what Albert is trying\nto say? OP is about Frank?\n[5:08 PM, 6/20/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Its about discovering the taste of amness then reintegrating that taste\ninto somatic.. like after anatta\n[5:08 PM, 6/20/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Someone asking about self enquiry\n[5:11 PM, 6/20/2020] John Tan: Yes. Did I tell you that at certain phase you have to switch to somatic and\nenergy practice and that is the turn point where intellectual is replaced by sensing energy and somatic-\nbody presence.\n[6:03 PM, 6/20/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. I think so.. last year\n[6:04 PM, 6/20/2020] John Tan: It is the time when I told you to practice yoga.\nLabels: Albert Hong, Anatta, Energy, I AMness, Luminosity 0 comments | |”\nSomeone asked, “In the spirit of a recent thread considering the heart, metta, etc., I was considering that, for me,\nan inquiry alone approach to insight is not skillful. That is, not only are other practices important for balanced\ndevelopment, but inquiry simply will not yield insight without certain other practices to help it penetrate to the\nnecessary depth. I was wondering what others' experiences are in this regard, particularly those further along in\ntheir inquiry. Were there other practices you did that you know were crucial in your inquiry yielding insight? What\nwere they? Did it change at different stages of insight?\nFor me, at my beginner level, I can tell that for \"Who am I\" inquiry to be successful I have to come more into myself\non all levels. Come fully into the body, fully into the heart, fully into the senses, fully into a mind without thought.\nSo I do practices related to these things.”\nSoh replied, “It is possible to skew to certain aspects but must catch up with the others later.\nFor me I skewed towards self enquiry and awareness in earlier years. I would inquire both in formal sittings\nand even in daily activities whenever circumstances permit. But in later years I had to look into other\naspects.\nThis is similar to the Buddha saying that there are a few possibilities -- someone may master insight before\nsamadhi (meditative absorption), may master samadhi before insight, may master both in tandem. Both\nare important and necessary to master for the purpose of liberating one's afflictions/defilements and put\na complete end to suffering.\n224\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe Buddha did not say 'you have to do insight first before samadhi' or 'you have to do samadhi first before\ninsight' or 'you must definitely do both in tandem', nor does he say 'you must definitely focus on metta\n(loving-kindness) first'. He simply listed the possibilities and taught the different practices, and his students\nwere made of various groups, each group were drawn to different practices (some focused on metta\n(loving-kindness), some anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), some trained on insight under Sariputta\nand others in samadhi under Moggallana, etc).\nHowever, many were sent to the arahant Sariputta first to train in insight in order to attain stream entry,\nfollowed by training under the other arahant Mogallana in order to develop the samadhi necessary for the\nattainment of arahantship.\nAs a side note, John Tan basically informed me (Soh) many years back that his depth of clarity in insights is\nvery thorough, in fact we can’t find it described in books (Especially the part of view, realization and\nexperience, and the integration of +A and -A). However if you are seeking advice on developing very deep\nsamadhi, like deep mastery of jhanas, samadhi, and so on like Mogallana, or being able to remain in\nabsorption for days and months like Ramana Maharshi, then perhaps you should find some other guide or\nperson to train under in those areas.\nTherefore how each person's journey unfolds is different and equally valid. Walk the path you feel drawn\nto (as long as it leads to insight and tranquility), what feels right to you, and what you find most effective\nfor you based on your experience. But be aware of what is lacking and continue to work towards a balanced\nand mature practice in all areas - wisdom, compassion, samadhi, energy practices, conduct, etc. I think it is\ngood however to have a balanced approach from the start if possible.\nFor example, right now I need to focus more on somatic and energy practices because certain issues\n(energy imbalances) surfaced recently (but thankfully resolved in a week). Perhaps if I mastered them from\nthe beginning I will face less problems. Yet by facing those energy imbalances, I've learnt something, so it's\nboth good and bad, the good side being that I've learnt the importance of release on the energetic level,\nbeing light as feather and immense as universe, and the harmfulness from the wrong approach of\noverfocusing on the experience (especially in intense PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) in the senses,\nor the I AM) as that pattern of overfocused intense radiance is itself tenseness/tension and subtle clinging.\nThe bad side - well, it's going to disrupt your life, it's going to be unpleasant, you may not be able to function\nas normal, and if unsolved and gone to the extreme (usually the case if one does not have a good teacher\n-- fortunately I had John Tan to guide me), it's going to be a very painful experience for a prolonged period\nof time (sometimes years).\nYesterday I just had a very short transient period where the caffeine in tea (I drank one cup of coffee and\nthen tea a couple of hours later) triggered a slight re-run of the energy imbalance episode, however\nfortunately it resolved itself not too long later. A reminder also to be more somatic and circulate my\n225\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nenergies. I'm ok today. (Also it is wise to refrain or reduce on caffeine if your energy and radiance is already\nheightened)\nI would go as far to say that even the Buddha was experimental in his approach to teaching various\nmethods to students. For example, after teaching the contemplation on the impurity of body, 60 monks\nwent to commit suicide out of disgust of their own body. After he found out about this, the Buddha then\nswitched to teaching anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). But the contemplation on the impurity of the\nbody is quite a good way of practicing (especially as a means of overcoming lust and passion, but I have no\nexperience in this method of practice and therefore cannot advise others on it), however just that like many\nmethods, it comes with certain dangers when done by the wrong type of people. So what resonates or is\nsuitable for one person may not be so for another. For example, Ajahn Maha Boowa wrote about his\nsuccess in practicing the contemplation on the impurity of the body.\nIn short, what works for one may not work as well for another, so you have to experiment and find what\nworks best for yourself.\n…\nRamana and Eckhart Tolle realised the Self the very first time they spontaneously did self enquiry. I\npracticed self enquiry for almost two years. So... each person is different. Ramana became more devotional\nafter Self-Realization. Some people were devotional before Self-Realization, e.g. Greg Goode mentioned\nabout devotion leading to some opening of the heart that facilitated his non-dual inquiry. Metta definitely\nhas the same heart opening potential and can definitely aid inquiry and other non dual contemplations.\nPersonally I'm never the really devotional kind but I still pray to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas at times.\n…\nAlso as an alternative to Self-Enquiry, John Tan back then asked me to look into the Do Nothing method by\nShinzen Young as another alternative way to realize the Self. However I did not focus on that practice.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/9z75xwl111jntey/Shinzen%20young%20ReturntotheSource.pdf?dl=0\n…\nA conversation with John Tan more than 10 years ago:\nMe: By the way is it possible to experience I AMness without self inquiry? for example the person who wrote\n\"awareness watching awareness\" just focus on awareness alone then experienced I AMness. He didn’t ask\n\"Who am I\". but I think \"Who am I\" is very useful\n226\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThusness: it is possible but the sort [of practice] it is a more gradual approach. It will not have that sort of\n'Eureka' factor. The next step (into non-dual) is to bring this into the foreground by practicing bare attention\nof our body sensations. The Eureka factor is very important part for Realization. Self Inquiry is the Direct\n(not gradual) method to Self-Realization.\n…\n16th October 2010\nSomeone asked, “AEN, I remember you said without practicing self-inquiry, it is impossible to attain I AM\nstage. If this is true, how do you explain Michael Langford's AWA method? J”\nMy reply:\nIt will lead to the I AM realization but will be a gradual path. Self inquiry is the direct path. Not long ago I\nhad a conversation with Thusness about this:\nAEN: btw what you think about what I said about kundalini?\nThusness: what did you say about kundalini?\nAEN: I said kundalini related practices may lead to experience but for realization you need to do some kind\nof investigation like self inquiry or koan. I mean I told mikael that\nThusness: no, both can lead to realization, koan is just an instrument. imo when you practice into a state\nof total openness, purity and clarity, you will realize your non-dual luminous essence\nAEN: oic.. but you also said experience and realization aren't the same right\nThusness: it isn't the same, but you are not talking about that\nAEN: what do you mean\nThusness: you are talking about kundalini and koan. you are not talking about experience and realization.\nkoan leads you to direct realization\nAEN: hmm but then you said practicing into a state of total openness, purity, clarity (state = experience?)\nyou then realize nondual luminous essence you mean the experience leads to realization?\nThusness: kundalini leads you differently... you would have to go through the path. they too lead to\nrealization of Self ultimately, however, the path is different. it is like (the difference between) gradual path\nand direct path\nAEN: when you said 'practicing into a state of total openness, purity and clarity' you’re referring to kundalini\npractice?\nThusness: yeah...all aim to reach such a state, where the Self is realized by kundalini, opening of chakras,\nby micro and macroscopic orbit of chi\nThusness: when you practice bringing to the foreground, you will also experienced complete and full\nintegration of energy. you may then focus on energy...\nAEN: oic.. the energy is the same as chi?\n227\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThusness: I do not know. I am not a chi gong master. go step by step...bring your experience to the\nforeground first... do not think you can fully understand no-self or have experienced the breadth and depth\nof no-self. it is not like what the AF people think, it is not in logic. When you are able to experienced fully\nand opening whatever arises without the sense of Self/self, it is different.\nAEN: I see.. btw you said by practicing openness, purity, clarity, it will lead to the realization... does that\nmean prolonged experience will eventually result in realization?\nThusness: it is not that... your question is too naïve. you are disregarding the entire path of practice. you\nare not knowing the purpose of that particular path of practice, what is the purpose of awakening the\nkundalini. have you gone into it before you asked?\nAEN: im not sure... Mr. J said it's very effective in bringing one to the experience of ego dissolution quickly\nso that you can know your luminous nature\nThusness: what are you asking now? are you asking about koan or kundalini or what?\nAEN: kundalini\nThusness: so you must study kundalini, how does awakening of kundalini lead to Self-Realization? it is the\nsame as koan, except that it is by way of awakening the magic serpent in this case. you do not need to\npenetrate by way of koan, koan might not suit everyone. if you ask your mum, it might be more suitable to\ndo chanting or even kundalini practice, but she would have to know the purpose of practice. much like your\ngrandmaster teach you 觉照 (illumination of awareness), same like teaching awareness of awareness. if you\npractice until there is total practice openness, pure like a mirror, spaciousness and luminous… if you\nstabilized these experiences, you will realize. but your experience and realization will be very stable, not\nlike direct path of realization, the strength is not there.\nAEN: same for kundalini? will the experience be stable?\nThusness: yeah...because they start from there opening gate by gate\nAEN: ic.. ya I remember, the one who taught awareness watching awareness practice, michael langford, he\npractice 2 to 12 hours of AWA practice everyday for almost 2 years... and then he achieved something like\neternal bliss or liberation or something but it sounded like he has a very very stable experience plus\nrealization through that practice alone\nThusness: yes. I have told you once you realized, you are guided by what?\nAEN: realization?\nThusness: you have not read what I told you\nAEN: you said sincerity and realization\nThusness: the top part\nAEN: oh the taste of a pure, original, primordial, non-conceptual and non-dual luminous state of existence\nThusness: yes. isn't that an experience? I have said I do not like to differentiate but it is just to bring out this\npoint, so you might stabilize your experience of mirror like clarity, you practice non-conceptuality and\nstabilized it. you practice purity of intention till you deconstruct personality\nAEN: oic..means after realization, one must work to stabilize those experiences?\nThusness: you can, and indirectly yes. but you can also do by further refining your realizations. like bringing\nthis experience to the foreground, and then you realized anatta, and then emptiness and self-liberation\nAEN: oic..\n228\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThusness: foreground practice becomes very important to you now. Now if you were to practice bringing\nthis experience to the foreground, what will you realized?\nAEN: non dual?\nThusness: how come?\nAEN: because one experiences one taste in all experiences\nThusness: no good\nAEN: there is no subject-object division in all experiences?\nThusness: I want you to experience directly. Whatever I tell you will only prevent you from experiencing\ndirectly\nAEN: there is no inside and outside, subject and object division in direct experience of sound, seeing, taste,\netc\nThusness: yes. You challenge 'inside/outside', boundaries, arising and ceasing... one by one. you must come\nto several important direct realizations. what did richard teach the AF practitioners? what is the question\nhe told all to focus?\nAEN: how am I experiencing this moment of being alive?\nThusness: yes. how is this different from bringing the experience to the foreground? anything special?\nAEN: I think 'being alive' can mean background or foreground depending on context of it being said\nThusness: you have already experienced the background, the AF are not interested in the background. if I\nask 2 +3 = ?, then I ask 3 + 2 = ? and you can answer the first question but not the second, what does it\nprove?\nAEN: that I dunnu maths? lol\nThusness: means you are not clear, you merely memorized\nAEN: ic.. ya\nThusness: you do not realize. if you realized, then do you think 2 + 3 is very different from 3 + 2?\nAEN: no\nThusness: same applies to what I asked you above.\n…\n● Soh Wei Yu IMO self-enquiry is even more direct than Michael Langford's Awareness Watching\nAwareness practice. Though they are in some ways related, AWA is a more gradual path towards\nSelf-Realization, but also effective. The reason for this is also explained in the AtR guide.\n● CI wrote: Ah, I see. I've been equating them as the similar. For self-inquiry I say \"what am i\" then\nallow myself to investigate the silence. For AWA it feels like I'm basking in the silence. I checked out\nthe guide and feel as thought I should have an \"I Am\" realization before moving further with the\nebook. Alot of the text has terms like lumosity and such which I'm not totally familiar. I come from\na Buddhists background and anatta is one of the three marks of existence. I assume anatta is the\ndropping off of selfhood completely which is pretty incredible. It reminds of 4th path. Coming from\nthe \"pragmatic dharma\" community some say 4th path is a myth. I'm unsure. Experience is king of\ncourse. Ok, I'll drop AWA and focus on self-inquiry.\n229\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n●\nSoh Wei Yu Not just silence but find out who/what is aware of that silence?\nWhat is Existence itself? What is Presence-Awareness? What am I? Who am I? Before birth, Who am\nI?\nI just wrote this to someone days back:\n\"when you are asking who am I, you should not be going after 'effects' or 'experiences', because all\nthese are besides the point. the only 'effect' you should be seeking is to find out and have\ncomplete certainty of what Self is, which is exactly what the question is about - Who am I? so you\nmust ask in a way that you really, really just want to know what 'I' or Self really is, and anything else\nis besides the point\n1\nthat realization can take months, or years for some (so be patient and/but not to seek after\nsomething in the future but just look directly into the immediate truth of your Being), depending,\nbut it must be asked with the intent of discovering your true Presence-Awareness as your very\nluminous essence. maybe also read some John Wheeler (the advaitin teacher) books or Ramana\nMaharshi books for pointers as well\nthe anatta stanza is for a different kind of insight\nbut again the emphasis must be on realization, insight into what is always already the case\ni usually ask people to go through the I AM realization first because without that, if people enter\ninto anatta they will usually skew to the first stanza and miss out the luminosity, then they will\nneed to bring it out at another phase -- luminosity and intensity of luminosity\nso you must understand the anatta stanza has a different purpose from Who am I, it leads to\ndifferent insight and realization, but both are important and must be complemented\nand you must also understand that what is crucial for all these is Realization. without it, those\ncontemplations have not reached its purpose\nmr. rdt wrote about how he made a mistake by focusing on experience through bahiya sutta\nrather than contemplating on the nature of mind as anatta \"\n●\nSoh Wei Yu Also, after anatta you can also come to understand that the I AM is not in any way\nnegated but only correctly understood, so this is in no way contradictory to Buddhism and anatta,\nin fact all the direct path traditions in Buddhism teaches one to realise I AM first (from thai forest\nto many forms of zen, dzogchen and mahamudra)\n...\n230\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWhen I was practicing Self-Enquiry, John Tan told me to practice 'dropping' as well. Means as separate\nsessions -- morning practice self enquiry, at night practice dropping. However I personally skewed towards\nthe self enquiry part. That said, dropping is also important and the experience of intense luminosity without\nbeing accompanied by letting go (even of the radiance) can lead to other issues as mentioned above.\nA rather balanced book I would think is “True Meditation” by Adyashanti that seems to incorporate both\naspects. If you are practicing self-enquiry, do check out that book.\n(1:34 AM) Thusness: you need to understand that even up to the phase of non-dual, is still not anatta and\nDO, so you must further refine your so called 'advaita vedanta' experiences :) but learn to drop, mind\nbody and presence. at night learn how to drop. morning and after, practice vivid, non dual awareness\nFortunately my I AM phase was blissful, unlike John Tan who experienced energy imbalances and insomnia\nwhich is why he said after I AM one suffers more (in his experience). I didn't face those issues because I did\nnot practice wrongly and focus on the wrong things - thanks to John Tan's guidance, instead I focused on\nthe four aspects of I AM and transitioned into non dual and anatta smoothly over the next eight months.\nOverfocusing on the third eye chakra (even if unknowingly, although also commonly taught by teachers)\ncan also be problematic and dangerous, therefore it is advisable to always start from the dan tien/abdomen\nas base and one must circulate the energies.\n…\nYes, Who am I? should be contemplated like a koan (not intellectual). Something that stumps your mind\nand results in direct and non-conceptual realization, like what is the sound of one hand clapping? And yet\nthat koan leads to non dual, while who am I? leads to I AM.\nShamatha practices simply provides the prerequisite for a successful inquiry, because you can't inquire\nproperly and realize Self if your mind is all over the place.\nRamana Maharshi's books go into all these, which I readily recommend to anyone keen on self-enquiry\n(other relevant authors include Michael A. Singer, Eckhart Tolle, John Wheeler, Galen Sharp, Adyashanti,\netc). Ramana would first teach people to try Self Enquiry, but if one is not successful with these he would\nrecommend other methods like breath control, surrendering, and so on. The purpose of these methods\nlike breath-control should be to quieten the mind so that one can then return and abide as the Source\nthrough enquiry. \"Be still and know that I AM God.\"\nSomeone asked, “What do you mean by dropping?”\nSoh replied, “Release, relax, let go of everything.\n231\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n2008:\n(3:40 PM) Thusness: Yes. You are already experiencing \"I AMness\" and that is natural. :) That insight of non-\nduality will not come that easily. :) even glimpses after glimpses, it will not be obvious and clear. :) The most\ndifficult task of all practice is 'letting go'. You can take life after life, you will not understanding the essence\nof it. though ultimately there is not even a letting go, with the sense of 'self', the essence will not be\nunderstood. so don't underestimate it. You must practice letting go. drop your body, mind… all. I told you\nto practice dropping right?\n(3:43 PM) AEN: yes\n(3:43 PM) Thusness: give up. give up everything… everything during your practice. in meditation just\npractice that. within that period of meditation, it should be fully and totally dedicated to giving up… of\neverything. whenever there is holding even the slightest sense, there is self. all thoughts, all teachings,\neverything, family, mind, life...let go. be a true monk in that period of meditation.\n(3:45 PM) AEN: ya drop everything and be natural right, cos luminosity is like naturally present\n(3:45 PM) Thusness: don't think of that when you are doing meditation, the letting go that I told you.\n(3:46 PM) AEN: what you mean?\n(3:46 PM) Thusness: if I want you to find out what is presence, I would not have told you 'letting go'. there\nis only total giving up. there is no intention even to find out what is presence, what is buddha nature.\n(3:47 PM) AEN: but I still think I’m not very clear on presence\n(3:47 PM) Thusness: did I tell you to do that, to find out what buddha nature is? you only have to give up\neverything, not to reason… initially you will want to understand....but keep this in mind and as a practice.\nto arise non-dual insight, these 2 practices must go hand in hand, but it will take years\n(3:49 PM) AEN: oic\n(3:50 PM) Thusness: Initially without fail, it will always appear as the background, the eternal witness. It is\nnecessary and from there know the 'strength' of propensities.”\nSomeone asked, “Isnt letting go another form of grasping? Is it a concession to make as a practice until realization\noccurs? Kinda like effortful mindfulness.”\nSoh replied,\n“Letting go is not necessarily grasping. You can reach very deep levels of degrasping like John Tan Stage 3\nwithout realizing anatta, but it becomes like a trance state samadhi, temporary.\nThere are different levels of dropping, the 5th and 6th requires anatta [to be effortless].\nSix Stages of Dropping\n232\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nFirst is ‘someone’ is dropping…\nSecond is dropping appears as a mirror reflecting…\nThird is there is only endless dropping without footing and mental reasoning…\nFourth is dropping as vivid wide opening…\nFifth is vivid wide opening as everything…\nSixth is only Dharma spontaneously manifesting…\n(by Thusness/PasserBy)\nYou must be able to sit for prolonged periods of time and have some mastery in shamatha/calm abiding\nmeditation, stilling both mind and body.”\nContemplative Practices to Focus On After I AM Realization\nFocus on practicing and contemplating the four aspects of I AM and two nondual inquiries.\n~ Four Aspects of I AM\nMany people get stuck in the initial I AM realization without much progress for decades. Fortunately Soh\nwas able to progress relatively quickly (8 months from I AM realization to non-dual and anatta) compared\nto John Tan and many others that Soh know, who got stuck for decades due to a lack of good pointers\nand directions for progress from experienced teachers.\nFor progress after I AM realization, John Tan taught me about the deepening of the \"I AM\" in 4 aspects: 1)\nthe aspect of impersonality, 2) the aspect of the degree of luminosity, 3) the aspect of dissolving the need\nto re-confirm and abide in I AMness and understanding why such a need is irrelevant, 4) the aspect of\nexperiencing effortlessness (John Tan: any form of clinging, be it Self/self or Presence, will prevent a\npractitioner from correctly experiencing 'effortlessness')\nBy focusing on these four aspects of I AM, then later going deeper into the two types of nondual\ncontemplations, Soh was able to make swift progress into non-dual and anatta realization.\n\"4 aspects are simply pathing you towards non-dual when you are in the phase of ultimate presence.\" –\nJohn Tan, 2020\n\"You must also understand that the four aspects are conveyed to you so that in the event you get lost in \"I\nAmness\", they can lead you back to the deeper insight of anatta and DO [Dependent Origination].\" - John\nTan, 2011\n233\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n2007:\n(12:39 PM) Thusness: when impersonality steps in, the bond of the background, the perceiver is\nsubstantially reduced. Yeah, that is why he is willing to give up [Soh: give up grasping and reifying] the \"I\nAM\" now...\n● 01 The Aspect of Impersonality;\nThis is the case when practitioners experience that everything is an expression of a universal cosmic\nintelligence. There is therefore no sense of a personal doer... rather, it feels like I and everything is being\nlived by a higher power, being expressed by a higher cosmic intelligence. But this is still dualistic – there is\nstill this sense of separation between a 'cosmic intelligence' and the 'world of experience', so it is still\ndualistic.\nSoh experienced impersonality after the I AM realization, however some people experience it before I AM\nrealization. Some of the Theistic Christians may not have I AM realization (it depends - although many\nChristian mystics including Jesus Christ (https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/jesus-christ-\ncosmic-consciousness-alan.html) himself have pointed out the I AM realization), however through their\nsurrendering to Christ, they can drop their sense of personal doership and experience the sense of 'being\nlived by Christ', as in Galatians 2:20: \"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives\nin me.\". This is an experience of impersonality that may or may not come with the realization of I AM. And\nas Sailor Bob Adamson said, \"That separate entity, the belief in that entity or person, has never done a\ndamn thing! It never can and never will. You must realize that you have been lived. That body-mind that\nyou call 'you' is being lived, and it is being lived quite effortlessly. As Christ said, 'Which of you, by taking\nthought, can add one cubit to his stature?' That separate entity can’t do a bloody thing.\"\nAlso from Sailor Bob Adamson, “What I'm talking about is that same intelligence that functions the universe.\nThe very fact that the stars can orbit or the planets can orbit around the earth and form out of the gases\ninto the particular shape and form and hold that form implies an intelligence. That which keeps the seasons\ncoming and going implies an intelligence. The tides coming in and out implies an intelligence. Look at it\nclosely. It is beating your heart right now. It is growing your hair and your fingernails. It is digesting your\nfood. It is replacing the cells in your body. The patterning and functioning of this body implies that there is\na wonderful intelligence expressing through it, as it. And that is actually what you are—that intelligence-\nenergy. It formed you, grew you and is continuing to grow you. It is replacing the cells in your body and\ndoing other things naturally, the same as it is in the universe. But that natural state has seemingly been\nclouded over by the reasoning or the functioning of the mind. Look at the body and break it down. There\nis no center here in this body that I can say 'This is what I am'. It started with the sperm and the ovum\ncoming together. If the body had any center it would be that original cell. But that is long since gone. There\nare many cells dying in this body right now and being replaced.”\n234\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n\"The ‘knock-out blow’ was seeing the absence of a person. There is no such entity in the machine. There\nare only thoughts, experiences and objects arising and subsiding in awareness. There is no one controlling\nthem and no one affected by them. Once this is seen, everything happens just as before, but the imagined\nperson is removed from the film. The film goes on but there is no person starring in it. There are thoughts,\nbut no thinker; actions, but no actor; choices, but no choice-maker. Basically, there is no difference from\nbefore, except the sense of separation is gone, along with the psychological suffering, confusion and doubt\nthat appears along with the belief in a separate ‘I’. There is no one at the controls. Life is happening;\nthoughts are arising; actions are occurring spontaneously. You, as a separate person, are not doing any of\nthese things. You don’t choose your thoughts, feelings, sensations. As Bob says, ‘You are being lived’.\" - John\nWheeler, https://awakeningclaritynow.com/awakening-to-the-natural-state-guest-teaching-by-john-\nwheeler/\n\"Thinking, seeing, living, breathing and so on all are going on just fine. The limited ‘I’ notion comes in\nas a subsequent concept. Just because you are not a limited, isolated, defec-tive person, why should\nany of the natural functioning stop? Life goes on just as before but without any reference to the\nassumed self-center. You say, ‘Who or what is doing this sorting and selecting, coming and going? And since\nthere is no “I”, why not just not step back, stop, refuse to participate in the fake “I” game, and just let the\nriver take its course?’\nWho is there to step back? Who is present to refuse to participate? Who is there to let the river\ntake its course? All appears in awareness and functions. The separate person is not. Your question\nimplies that without a self-concept, no functioning is possible. That is not true. Which self-center is\nbeating your heart? None! When you say ‘Why not just step back?’, you are bringing in a tacit reference to\nan entity with the capacity to do that. There is no one there to step back or refuse to play the game. The\nfake ‘I’ game, as you call it, is a fake game. When seen, it is all over. All your questions are really\nhanging on the assumed reality of the conceptual ‘I’: that it is either necessary for functioning,\nwhich is false, or that it is present to step back, refuse, not decide or whatever.\nYou say, ‘There are decisions but no decider, doing but no doer, acting but no actor, thinking but\nno thinker’. This is it exactly. All these things are going on and will continue to do so. There is just\nno ‘I’ doing any of it. This is a descrip-tion of your own experience, even now. Seeing is happening. Thinking\nis happening. Later the mind comes in and posits an ‘I’ doing those things, but that ‘I’ is only a concept.\nThe ‘I’ concept cannot see, think or do anything. Are ‘you’ beating your heart or growing your hair? Yet\nthere is no problem with any of that functioning. It is the same with thoughts also. It is an illusion to think\nthere is a ‘you’ manufacturing thought. Do you know what the next thought is going to be before it\nappears? No! Then how can you say ‘you’ created it? You cannot! And yet it happens just fine.\nYou ask, ‘Why not just sit on a bench, blow smoke rings towards the sun and talk to the birds?’ Yes, if\nthere is any entity present to do that! If it happens it will happen; if not, not. Planning, deciding and\n235\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nfunctional activity do not imply or require a separate self concept. In fact, things fl ow better without\nthat erroneous notion mucking up the works.\nYou say, ‘How did those decisions get made without some kind of a reference point?’ That is just it. It is a\nreference point, not who you are. Until people look into this, they are apt to confuse the reference point,\nwhich is a conceptual construct, with their actual identity. With the basic identity clear, you can use\nthe reference point, if necessary, but not be used by it.\nIn all of this, have you left your true being at any time?\" – John Wheeler, Clear in Your Heart,\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0125/1442/t/2/assets/clear-in-your-heart-sample.pdf\nIt should be noted that impersonality is not just an experience of non-doership. It is the dissolving of the\nconstruct of 'personal self' that led to a purging of ego effect to a state of clean, pure, not-mine sort of\n\"perception shift\", accompanied with a sense that everything and everyone is being expressions of the\nsame aliveness/intelligence/consciousness. This can then be easily extrapolated into a sense of a 'universal\nsource' (but this is merely an extrapolation and at a later phase is deconstructed) and one will also\nexperience 'being lived' by this greater Life and Intelligence.\n“Of course, make no mistake, from the point of view of the total Understanding this teaching about whether\nyou are the doer is in fact redundant; the question does not even arise. With the Understanding comes the\nnatural and spontaneous apperception that there is no one here no individual to either be the doer or not\nbe the doer. So the question is moot. What you think of as yourself; the whole package of body, mind,\npersonality, ego, sense of individuality, personal history; none of that even exists as such, as anything other\nthan an idea, a story, a concept in Consciousness. The discussion of whether or not 'you' can be a doer or\nnot is, as Wei Wu Wei writes, like discussing whether the bird in the empty cage is captive. The cage is empty!\nThere is nobody home!\nAt the morning talks recently there has been a musician who plays traditional Indian flute for the group\nafter the talks. The flute does not know music: it does not know 'G'from 'B flat;' it does not know tempo or\nemphasis, and cannot make music come out of itself: it's just a hollow bamboo stick with holes in it! It is\nthe musician who has the knowledge and the skill and the intention and the dexterity, and whose breath\nblows through the instru-ment and whose fingers manipulate the openings so that beautiful music flows\nout. When the music is ended, no one congratulates the wooden stick on the music it made: it is the\nmusician who is applauded and thanked for this beautiful gift of music.\nIt is precisely so with what we think of as our 'selves.'\nWe are instruments, hollow sticks, through which the Breath, the Spirit, the Energy which is Presence, All\nThat Is, Consciousness, flows. Just as it is not the flute making the note, but the Musician making the note\nthrough the instrument, so it is the breath which is Presence which animates this mind and body and comes\n236\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nout through this mouth to make it seem that this mouth is speaking words. The basic misunderstanding,\nthe basic ignorance, is this unwitting usurpation of the role of Musician by the instru-ment. This inversion\nof the truth is spontaneously realized when the Understanding occurs. It becomes obvious that there is no\nindividual, that there is 'nobody home,'no entity’ here to be the doer or not. Because awakening is simply\nthe Understanding that there is no one here to awaken.” – David Carse, Perfect Brilliant Stillness\nhttps://www.perfectbrilliantstillness.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Book-from-\nPerfectBrilliantStillness.org_.pdf\nImpersonality will help dissolve the sense of self but it has the danger of making one attached to a\nmetaphysical essence or to personify, reify and extrapolate a universal consciousness. It makes a\npractitioner feel \"God\". At this phase it is good to focus on this impersonal and universal aspect of\nconsciousness, but beware of the tendency to extrapolate.\n“...Next — and remarkably there is a next — we become aware of the other side of I Am, of the source from\nwhich it arises, within a stillness of surpassing quality. We see our I as a knot that blocks off the depths, a\nknot that makes itself the source of our will, intentions, choices, and decisions, including the intention to\nmeditate in this moment. Gradually we loosen the knot until it gives way, until I let go entirely of being\nmyself, of being my own source.\nUntil this point, our ascent has been into the depths within us. But always we have remained at the core of\nthe experience, with the experience outside of us, of our core. Now we must empty that very core and open\nto what is deeper than our innermost center. We ourselves become the outside to the Sacred Will of the\nWorld, Who is our Source, and let that Will come through us, as us.\nWe inwardly prostrate ourselves, begging for reconnection, begging to become a part of that Greatness.\nSilently and wholeheartedly calling out to the Ultimate, completely and utterly opening the very kernel of\nwho we are, we reach beyond the world of sacred light, into the unbounded emptiness, which is also an\noverflowing fullness, an intimacy with all, with the All.\nThis is the Sacred Will of the World,\nOf Whom I am now a particle,\nWho lends me the will to be myself,\nWho lends me my I,\nWho is my very Self,\nWhom I hope to become able to serve by emptying myself unconditionally,\nIn Whom we are all united,\n237\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAnd Who continuously creates and sustains this universe in love.\nThis ultimate stage of the meditation comes only as an act of grace from Above. It lies well beyond our\nability to make happen, although our emptiness, our surrender, and our love are necessary. Attempting to\nenter here, prayer may help. If you are so inclined, silently repeat one of God’s names, one close to your\nheart, one that both expresses your yearning and brings you peace.\nIn closing the meditation, we climb back down Jacob’s Ladder to return to our daily life, though somewhat\nchanged inwardly. We come, in turn, back to the sacred light, back to the cognizant stillness of\nconsciousness and the presence of I Am, back to sensation and relaxation, and thus back to the base of the\nladder. We rest in awareness as the meditation settles in us.” - Joseph Naft, A Meditation: Climbing Jacob's\nLadder, https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/good-for-different-phasesaspects-of-i.html\n“I AM the Tree of Life within you. My Life will and must push forth, but It will do it by gradual and steady\ngrowth. You cannot come into your fruitage before you have grown to it. Remember, My Life is all the time\nbuilding you up into the perfection of health and strength and beauty, that must express outwardly as It is\neven now expressing within. You who have begun to realize I AM within, but have not yet learned to\ncommune with Me, listen and learn now…\n...Yes, this cell consciousness is common to every cell of every body, no matter what its kind, because it is\nan Impersonal consciousness, having no purpose other than doing the work allotted it. It lives only to work\nwherever needed. When through with building one form, it takes up the work of building another, under\nwhatever consciousness I desire it to serve.\nThus it is likewise with you. You, as one of the cells of My Body, have a consciousness that is My\nConsciousness, an intelligence that is My Intelligence, even a will that is My Will. You have none of these for\nyourself or of yourself. They are all Mine and for My use only.\nNow, My consciousness and My Intelligence and My Will are wholly Impersonal, and therefore are common\nwith you and with all the cells of My Body, even as they are common with all the cells of your body.\nI AM the directing Intelligence of All, the animating Spirit, the Life, the Consciousness of all matter, of all\nSubstance. If you can see it, You, the Real you, the Impersonal you, are in all and are one with all, are in Me\nand are one with Me; just as I AM in you and in all, and thereby am expressing My Reality through you and\nthrough all.\nThis will, which you call your will, is likewise no more yours personally than is this consciousness and this\nintelligence of your mind and of the cells of your body yours. It is but that small portion of My Will which I\npermit the personal you to use. Just as fast as you awaken to recognition of a certain power or faculty within\nyou and begin consciously to use it, do I allow you that much more of My Infinite Power.\n238\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAll power and its use is but so much recognition and understanding of the use of My Will. Your will and all\nyour powers are only phases of My Will, which I supply to suit your capacity to use it. Were I to entrust you\nwith the full power of My Will, before you know how consciously to use it, it would annihilate your body\nutterly.\nTo test your strength and more often to show you what the misuse of My Power does to you, I at times\nallow you to commit a sin, so-called, or to make a mistake. I even permit you to become inflated with the\nsense of My Presence within you, when It manifests as a consciousness of My Power, My Intelligence, My\nLove; and I let you take these and use them for your own personal purposes. But not for long -- for, not\nbeing strong enough to control them, they soon take the bit in their teeth, run away with you, throw you\ndown in the mire, and disappear from your consciousness for the time being.\nAlways I AM there to pick you up, after the fall, although you do not know it at the time; first straightening\nyou out and then starting you onward again, by pointing out the reason for your fall; and finally, when you\nare sufficiently humbled, causing you to see that these powers accruing to you by the conscious use of My\nWill, My Intelligence and My Love, are allowed you only for use in My Service, and not at all for your own\npersonal ends.\nDo the cells of your body, the muscles of your arm, think to set themselves up as having a separate will\nfrom your will, or a separate intelligence from your intelligence? No, they know no intelligence but yours,\nno will but yours. After a while it will be that you will realize you are only one of the cells of My Body; and\nthat your will is not your will, but Mine; that what consciousness and what intelligence you have are Mine\nwholly; and that there is no such person as you, you personally being only a physical form containing a\nhuman brain, which I created for the purpose of expressing in matter and Idea, a certain phase of which I\ncould express best only in that particular form.\nAll this may be difficult for you now to accept, and you may protest very strenuously that it cannot be, that\nevery instinct of your nature rebels against such yielding and subordinating yourself to an unseen and\nunknown power, however Impersonal or Divine.\nFear not, it is only your personality that thus rebels. If you continue to follow and study My Words, all will\nsoon be made clear, and I will surely open up to your inner understanding many wonderful Truths that now\nare impossible for you to comprehend. Your Soul will rejoice sing glad praises, and you will bless these\nwords for the message they bring…\n...The proof of this is, man does not and cannot breathe of himself. Something far greater than his conscious,\nnatural self lives in his body and breathes through his lungs. A mighty power within his body thus uses the\nlungs, even as it uses the heart to force the blood containing the life it drew through the lungs to every cell\nof the body; as it uses the stomach and other organs to digest and assimilate food to make blood, tissue,\n239\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhair and bone; as it uses the brain, the tongue, the hands and feet, to think and say and do everything that\nman does.”\n- The Impersonal Life by Joseph Benner, a book on Christian Mysticisim emphasizing on the aspect of\nimpersonality after I AM realization\n“When we move from \"I AMness\" and mature the deconstruction of personality, we experience God-Like\nqualities. Seeing everything as one manifestation of 'One Life' and Presence being the same for everyone.\n...just the isness without the individuality. Once this individuality is gone (Whether permanently or\ntemporary), you will intuit that all as sharing the Source or as Manifestation of this Source. But that is not\nnon-duality. That is impersonality. :) That is why you need to experience that too.” - John Tan, 2009\n“(6:06 PM) AEN: Eckhart Tolle: \"Ultimately nothing is yours. you are giving energy because that energy\nwhatever form comes from the source of all energies. all energies derives from one's source. so you allow\nyourself to be a vehicle in which this energy flows out into the world, and then the sense of me, the doer,\nisn't there,\nand the sense that there is a poor person that i am helping isn't there either. so there is simply the process\nthat happens through you. and that is the non egoic way, and to be of service is a beautiful practice because\nthe ego is out of the way, and through\n(6:06 PM) AEN: that you realize you don't own anything ultimately, and the energy is not yours, it's\nuniversal energy that comes through.\"\n(10:14 PM) Thusness: In layman term yes\nbut what is this energy\n(10:15 PM) Thusness: anyway, where you get this quote from?\n(10:15 PM) AEN: i just watched a video by eckhart tolle just now, quoted from there\nrecent talk\n(10:16 PM) AEN: the energy is simply life?\n(10:16 PM) Thusness: icic... seems like he has moved from \"I AM\" to the \"impersonality\"\n(10:16 PM) Thusness: there is always only life expressing, no you.” - June 2010\n“Session Start: Saturday, 5 June, 2010\n(11:27 PM) Thusness: certainty of being when you focus on the 4 aspects till the peak and with right\nunderstanding, you will also have the same experience as anatta and emptiness. when you felt that the will\nof the source becomes your will, you become life itself, that is the same experience. actually all is the same\nexperience except that buddhism provides the right understanding. in the experience of \"I AM\" and the\narticle you posted about the divine, what is the peak of experience phase?\n(11:48 PM) AEN: which article about divine?\nHmm im not sure\n(11:49 PM) Thusness: the article about the source after \"I AM\"\n240\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(11:50 PM) AEN: is it like the 'sacred will of the world'\ni mean the peak of experience\n(11:51 PM) Thusness: after glimpses and realization of the source, when the divine will becomes your will.\nyou must be able to experience every manifestation as the grace of divine will. so must understand this in\nterms of direct experience and right view. :) i will talk to you when we meet. do you know why there is the\nsensation of a 'divine will'?\n(11:57 PM) AEN: bcos the sense of self is being let go... and its seen that everything is spontaneously\narising from the source\n(11:58 PM) Thusness: and what is this 'source' that seems to be doing the work?\n(11:59 PM) AEN: consciousness, life?\n(11:59 PM) Thusness: isn't \"I AM\" the consciousness?\n(12:00 AM) AEN: ya but at the beginning it still feels like an individuated sense of presence... but then later\nits seen as more impersonal, like everything is merely the expression of the source\n(12:00 AM) Thusness: first you must understand the separation is due to dualistic thought, thought\nseparates. do you know what is the 'divine' will? the sensation due to \"the sense of self is being let go... and\nits seen that everything is spontaneously arising from the source\" causes the 'divine will'\n(12:02 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:03 AM) Thusness: what is the divine will?\n(12:03 AM) AEN: it means its happening due to the divine source, nothing is happening due to an individual\nwill/agent/doer\n(12:04 AM) Thusness: when someone hit the bell, anything due to divine will?\n(12:05 AM) AEN: its also divine will bcos there is ultimately no separate person who acts, and no separate\nperson who experience.. everything is manifested by the divine will... including every action that is\nspontaneously arising\n(12:05 AM) Thusness: when someone hit the bell, anything so divine?\n(12:05 AM) AEN: it’s a manifestation of consciousness\n(12:05 AM) Thusness: no good no good. because of the lack of understanding of your nature. your nature\nis empty. what is this divine will? it is just DO [dependent origination]. because we think in terms of entity\nand the 'weight of this dualistic and inherent' tendencies makes us feel separate and inherent. instead of\nseeing 'DO', we see it as divine will. not knowing empty nature, we mistaken DO for divine will. not knowing\nno-self nature, we thought we are independent. when no-self is fully experienced and insight of anatta rises,\nyou do not feel source as separated from 'you'\nthere is merely manifestation, empty luminosity. empty as in DO and therefore does not require 'divine\nwill', yet all manifests due to empty nature, effortless and spontaneous. there is conditions that are required\nfor manifestations. a 'divine will' is not necessary\n(12:11 AM) AEN: icic..\n(12:12 AM) Thusness: when a practitioner realizes no-self and anatta insight arises, he clearly sees\nconditions. there is no divine will to listen to, but whenever condition is, manifestation is. slowly understand\nthis. do not see DO as something dead. see it as direct manifestation of your breathe just like you\n241\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nexperience everything as the grace of this divine will. feel this grace of life everywhere. letting go of yourself\ncompletely and feel this life\n(12:18 AM) AEN: oic.. i am writing my experience to lzls lol\n(5:36 PM) Thusness: Lol.

(xiang, image) is simply a construct. That is from a dualistic point of view, being\n'connected' must always be the case. When you de-contruct personality, you merely discover. a practitioner\nmust also be aware of the 'weight' of these constructs. from an empty point of view, when the tendency is\nthere, it is also not right to say that the interconnected state is always there, always the case. Obviously\n'you' are not 'connected'. when the 'construct' is strong, there is no such experience or when the\n'personality' is there, there is no experience of '万物同体' (everything has the same substance/source). Or\n'personality' is that very experience of individuality and therefore cannot have any experience of same\n'source'. get it?\n(6:19 PM) AEN: ic.. ya\n(6:19 PM) Thusness: the former does not realize the causes and conditions for any arising. when we say\nit is always 'there' we are having 'absolute view'. If we cling to that, then that will prevent clear seeing. So\nwhat is the experience of 'individuality' like? it is the very experience of what practitioner before the\n'connection' feel and understand. that is a state of reality, cannot be said to be determined or not.\n(6:21 PM) AEN: oic.. what you mean by that is a state of reality cannot be said to be determined or not\n(6:22 PM) AEN: hmm i think i get what you mean. so one must deconstruct the individuality otherwise\nthere is no feeling of connection\n(6:22 PM) Thusness: yes. for personality is the very state of individuality. what i want you to understand\nis not to have a pre-determined state.\n(6:26 PM) AEN: ic... that means according to conditions we experience the connection, but its not always\nthere?\n(6:27 PM) Thusness: yes it is better to understand that way\n(6:28 PM) Thusness: now when you experience certainty of being, you only experience the undeniability\nof your existence. doubtless, certain and present. but being connected to the source is different. it will also\ndetermine your later phase of practice. if you are attached to the Presence, what happened?\n242\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(6:31 PM) AEN: hmm. you mean when you are attached to Presence you will have difficulty seeing the\nconnection?\n(6:31 PM) Thusness: you wanted the state of Presence to transcend to the 3 states (waking, dreaming and\nsleeping) for you are only interested in that Certainty of Being. whereas when you realized the source, you\ndon't do that. you are surrendering much like the christian. you are devoting. nothing is important besides\nserving the divine. sustaining the state of presence and devoting to a divine source is different. you sleep\nwhen it is time to sleep. whatever thy will is. in Presence, you still think of control, in surrendering, you\nrealized you are being lived. Awareness is being done. it is almost the opposite, but then there is also the\nintegration\n(6:35 PM) AEN: oic.. Actually i think if we let go of control completely the presence is also naturally there,\nthere is no need to try to control presence\n(6:36 PM) Thusness: if you think that, that becomes a hindrance\n(6:36 PM) AEN: oic how come\n(6:36 PM) Thusness: coz you are torn in between. you are serving 2 masters. :P Presence and source. but\nthen there is also the integration where divine will becomes your will. then in jacob ladder meditation, after\nrealization and experience of the grace, it must be found everywhere. therefore you return to phase 1 of\nthe ladder with new understanding. you are directly and intuitively experiencing all manifestations as the\nexpression of life. where you and the divine become one, where phenomena and the divine becomes\nindistinguishable, as transient, as inner and outer world\n(6:40 PM) AEN: oic..\n(6:40 PM) Thusness: however that is because we are trying to express and understand this in an inherent\nand dualistic way. we speak in such a way because we are using a dualistic paradigm. and the experience\nseems difficult to reconcile and become seamless. so you must arise insight. you realized, what you call\nSelf/self is just a label. this is very difficult to understand. then you are not trapped in 'reconnection' or\nsurrendering.\nYou realized there is no-self (Soh: Thusness Stage 4 and 5). whatever experienced is vividly present and\naliveness everywhere because what that 'blocks' is no more there through the arising insight. now how\nclear are you in directly experiencing sensation? in experiencing sound, color, sight, taste? the mind at\npresent is more interested in the behind reality. so anatta transform the experience of individuality through\ninsight, clear seeing. there is a difference in saying what you call Awareness has always been sight, sound,\nthe scent of fragrance… and there is Awareness and there is sound, sight, taste… when you see and mature\nyour insight of anatta, it is realized that wrong view is what that is causing the problem. however after that,\nyou must practice directly\n(6:48 PM) AEN: what do you mean practice directly\n(6:48 PM) Thusness: means you don't think theoretically too much after the arising insight of anatta, there\nis a difference between thinking that a Weather truly exist and the changing clouds, the rain exist inside\nweather. get it? so when you took that to be real, it creates the problem of reification and intensifying the\ninherent existence of Self. if there is no-weight to the constructs, then there would be no problem.\nunfortunately, constructs are like spells. :)\n243\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(6:51 PM) AEN: oic..\n(6:52 PM) Thusness: do you get what i meant? just experience first. feel this aliveness everywhere. in other\nwords, what you realized is beyond ?

(xiang4: [imputed] appearance). anyway you can send your article to your lzls for comments. :)” - June,\n2010\n“There is a vast impersonal natural intelligence which is living you, or rather, it IS this life, this breathing,\nthis walking, this drinking... this life of the universe, of the earth spinning, .... all an interconnected play of\nDharma, of total life, intelligence, and awareness. The only blockage is simply this sense of an 'I', someone\nwho controls will and dictates actions in life.\nIf you think that I am sounding like an advocate of 'God', I have to reiterate that this so called 'God' or\nintelligent Mind is empty of its own existence apart from Dharma, is not something changeless and\nindependent, and is not some sort of source acting behind the scenes or pulling the strings. Because this\nvast impersonal intelligence is so magnificent, powerful and impersonal, it can give the impression that\nwe are all just the dream or expression of a Universal Mind of God, and if we follow this 'personification'\nand 'reification' we may start to think whether we are living in a matrix, a dream of Shiva for no other\nreason than his own enjoyment. But we are not the play or lila of a Brahman, there is no need to\npersonify or reify this at all. This intelligence IS the miracle of manifestation. The divine has no face of its\nown, and yet every face is the face of divinity. There is no I, no perceiver, or a controller of this\nspontaneous intelligent happening. Living this is living in complete ecstasy and joy born of this total\nintelligence, life and clarity.” - Soh, 2015, Vast Impersonal Intelligence (Note: I wrote this post-anatta\ninsight, therefore there is no more reification of this impersonal intelligence into universal consciousness)\nJohn Tan wrote in 2005 on the phases of I AM into impersonality:\nThusness: « Reply #7 on Jan 3, 2005, 10:04pm » Hi omsairam,\nYou are such a sincere seeker but do not get trap into too much analysis.\nWhen one first experienced Total Presence, how clear and vivid it was.\nBut when the experience descended into thought-level, It became \"I am I\", the name of Yaweh.\nAnd later a metaphysical Self, either way up above or deep down in us.\nEventually the 'I' becomes a tiny conscious being living inside our body seeking union with God that is\nDEEP down in us.\nAnd the beginning of all confusions and divisions.\nWhen we made progress by taking the 'I' out for a moment and transform \"I am I\" into \"Amness\", subject\nand object temporarily becomes one.\nThen We begin to wonder, how does God get slip outside and become IT?\nHas it always been an \"IT\" and never was an enclosed \"I\"?\nWas it always Suchness, Thusness, Isness?\n244\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIf you like thinking, think about it until you exhault the entirety of your thinking mechanism.\nUntil you are willing to let go.

I (Soh) did. However one should practice to experience\nthis aspect further after the I AM realization. This will also serve as one of the conditions for further non-\ndual insight. (You will also need to engage in nondual contemplation -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/two-types-of-nondual-contemplation.html - see below)\nThis aspect will come by practicing Vipassana, see John's Vipassana -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/thusnesss-vipassana.html and Vipassana -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/09/vipassana.html\n“It will be advisable to take a step back to re-visit and re-experience each of the 6 sense doors. To cultivate\na little on the aspect of being 'bare' for all the senses. Experience as much vividness as possible and have\nclarity on the luminous aspect of awareness first. Touch, taste, smell and sound… are all equally vivid as\n245\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ncompared to seeing. Experience the texture and fabric of awareness. The rest of the conditions that give\nrise to no-self will come later. :) There is no ‘willful’ entrance into non-duality, create enough conditions,\nthat’s all. :)” - John Tan, 2007\n“When we experience Awareness directly without using our thoughts, everything is experienced as having\na magical, alive, shimmery, fresh, amazing and blissful quality to it. Life is not the 'boring and ordinary' as\nthe mind interprets it, even the most ordinary things (such as eating, walking, etc) just feels awesome. You\nwill be naturally attracted, pulled towards the pristine awareness than to stressful thoughts. The ego will\nmelt in the wonder and majesty of awareness.” - Soh, 2009\n“I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such a sound before. My\neyes were still closed, and I saw the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound,\nthis is what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains.\nWithout any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminosity\nfiltering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room.\nI recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine,\nas if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marveling at the beauty\nand aliveness of it all.\nThat day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been\nborn into this world.\nFor the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished\nsomewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function\nin the world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had.\n…\nIn your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity that normally is only a means to an\nend and giving it your fullest attention, so that it becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk\nup and down the stairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, every movement,\neven your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all the sense\nperceptions associated with the activity: the sound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the\nscent of the soap, and so on. Or when you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for a few\nseconds and observe the flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent but powerful sense of presence.\nThere is one certain criterion by which you can measure your success in this practice: the degree of peace\nthat you felt within.” - Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now\n“I was walking through the park on my way home when something happened. Something holy arose from\nwithin and took over. I was standing there looking out at the trees and the grass like it was the first time I\n246\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nwas seeing them. I was looking at my hands and feeling my body as it moved and I was marvelling at being\nalive and being in this body. I was acutely aware of being in the world, that I was a separate being in the\nworld. I was enjoying all this as a child would enjoy a new and novel experience. I went over to a tree and\ngrabbed a branch, I touched it softly and then grabbed it firmly, I really wanted to feel the tree, I really\nwanted to be there with it, to be present, to feel and see and take it all in. I bent down and touched the\ntrunk near the roots, it was very real, very solid to my touch, it felt very alive. I noticed some bare earth\naround the tree trunk and picked up a chunk and broke it in my hand and watched and felt it crumble and\nstream through my fingers as it fell down to the earth. I was feeling so primal, so alive, I went around to the\nother side of the tree where the branches were a little higher off the ground and squatted under the\nbranches near the tree trunk and put my hand on the trunk and left it there. I was feeling the roots and\nfeeling extremely rooted myself in being. I stayed there for a few minutes, the feelings arising were so\nintense and overwhelming that tears were streaming down my face. Finally I left the tree and moved closer\nto the bench and sat and watched the crescent moon in the clear blue sky, there was a very bright star right\nbeside it, so bright that I thought it might be the headlight of a plane heading towards me. I sat there and\nwatched this scene and marvelled at life and being alive.\nI finally got up and was going to go inside but I had to walk by the sandbox and I was immediately attracted\nto the sand. I bent down and started letting the sand run through my fingers, feeling the texture of the\ngrains on the skin of my hand. I dug deeply into the sand and noticed that the sand was very damp when\nyou dug down 3 or 4 inches. And then I found a flat stone. I don't know why this was so fascinating but I\nwas like a little child, I would pick up the stone with a handful of sand and squeeze the sand so it would run\nthrough my fingers and then I would feel the hard stone pressing against the flesh of my palm and fingers.\nIt was like finding a treasure, I did this over and over again.\nI left the sandbox and moved over to a very large pine tree and grabbed on the branches really hard. I gave\na really good pull on it and ripped that piece of branch clean off and allowed the needles to run through\nmy fingers as they fell through the ground. I grabbed two branches, and held on really tight like I was\nholding hands with the pine tree, I looked up at it and was just present with it for a little while. But things\nwere beginning to feel really intense inside of me so I went inside.\nI went in the bedroom to change and got undressed, but when I was completely undressed I was drawn\ndown to my knees and I bent very low with my forehead against the carpet. The energy was flowing like\ncrazy inside, it felt like it was all emanating from the gut area. My head was on the carpet and my gut was\nmuch higher since I was still on my knees, this felt right as it had so many times before. Energy was flowing\nfrom my gut down through my head and out. But the energy also radiated outwards in all directions at the\nsame time, like a sacred sun was shining in my gut. It was extremely intense and overwhelming and\ncontinued for at least 15 minutes.\nI have no idea what is going on and I don't care. It feels very right and it makes everything sacred, my own\nbody, and everything else in the world. It's almost a mystical experience at times to be alive.\n247\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nI'm completely filled by this experience, it's overflowing.\nI love you.” - Din Robinson, the person to whom John Tan originally wrote the Thusness Stages in 2006\nSoh, 2020:\n“Someone (Olivier Sandilands) sent me this description and asked me to 'diagnose' it for him. I told him\nthis is what I call intensity of luminosity, check out AtR guide on it. However he has not experienced or\nrealised anatta, so it remains a glimpse. The peak of its intensity is when the sense of self completely\ndissolves into a state of no mind (no sense of subjectivity), but even then it remains an experience until\nrealisation.\nAfter dissolution of self/Self through realisation of anatman, this intensity of luminosity is experienced all\nmoments at its peak, it is my everyday effortless natural state.\n“At noon, after getting up and waiting for the bell to call us up for lunch, I kept an extremely relax and\nextremely sharp investigation of objects of perception going while sitting on a bench. Opening my eyes, I\nlooked at one of my fellow retreatants walking back to her room. This was astounding. I don't really know\nhow to explain it, but I believe I was experiencing emptiness in real time. It was absolutely clear that there\nwas no past and future in that immediate experience : though she was obviously changing position, her\nmovement was not of time. It was utter immanence, eternity : she was moving, and everything around\nher was moving ; yet nothing was moving. In fact, she didn't exist, and yet existed more than ever.\nSomething angelic.\nI got up, went to get my food. As I looked upon the face of some of my fellow meditators, I was struck by\ntwo profound things : first, I was perceiving them in such detail and in such a light, that they appeared like\nuniverses, like infinite things which had nothing to do with anything else ; each one of them was a miracle,\nright here in front of me, indistinct from me, of the same fabric. This brought about deep compassion and\nlove, which moves me to tears now as I write about it. As I was eating, in silence, my visual perception was\ndeepening. It was already quite astounding, in detail and brightness.\nBut now, looking at my fork, it was starting to really bloom in a crazy way. My forkful of dahl was the most\nbeautiful and rich thing I had ever seen. In fact, as I was letting that develop itself, myself just trying to\nrelax into it, it felt as if visual perception started to open, that I started to dissolve into it ; it felt like\nsomething untangled in the back, and that everything got bigger. It felt like a free fall into a world of\nunexpected richness, of a transfigured nature, timeless, the same as ever, yet totally different, raw, vivid,\ninescapably rich. In fact, this started to get freaky. I stopped the process. I felt some fear, but it was\nconfined to a tiny perception of my heart beating in the chest. I decided to chill out. But something had\nflipped. It was this : reality, become REAL. I now understand what realization must mean. Just that : reality\nbecome completely real.\nFor about two hours I explored the premices, walking around the pond, into the forest, etc. It was\ncompletely surreal, psychedelic. Visual perception was totally illuminated : every object that had some\nkind of brightness or movement was emitting intense light in the whole of my visual field. It was like the\nexperience I described earlier, x10, with an added depth to spatial perception that was astounding.\n248\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nFurthermore, I could \"freeze\" perception on command by stilling it on a particular object, which would\nstart to acquire the same \"transfigured\" quality I described. The same, yet totally different, totally new,\ntotally immanent : direct perception, pure unfolding of shapes and colors bound by nothing, flux.\nEmotionnally, I felt a mix of elation, incredulity, great amusement and mild background panic. What the\nhell was that ?? I skipped meditation to go lie down. Was this a side effect of my ear infection ? Was it the\nfirst phases of a visual migraine ? Have I gone nuts ? None of these... I talked with another meditator in\nthe hallway of one of the buldings. The best way I can describe it is : it was like a conversation on mdma.\nThe kind where one is both profoundly calm, at ease in a supernatural way (nothing can touch me), yet\nextremely sharp, loving and energetic. Visual perception was so sharp, in particular, any reflecion in the\nfield of vision, particularly the periphery, was perceived as a glowing neonish light. The face of that man\nwas beautiful to look at : shimmering with light, detailed, with a background sense of eternity infusing the\nwhole of perception... Man. Powerful.\"” (Note by Soh: it is important to understand the the terms\n‘Emptiness’ and ‘Realization’ used here is very different from how AtR uses these terms. This person’s\nexperience has more to do with the intensity of luminosity aspect, it has nothing to do with realizing the\nempty nature)\n\"I have already told you that in non-dual, especially anatta, the same sacredness you find in the\nbackground is also found in the transience. Identification is getting lost in the story or content. Not to\ndeny yourself the clarity of the essence and nature of the phenomena and aggregates. You do not resort\nto a background from disidentification. But from disidentification, realize the essence and nature of the\naggregates in its primordial and pure state. When you do that, you are dis-associating. When you dis-\nidentify from your body, you free yourself from the 'inherent aspect of the body construct' but is having a\nfull vivid experience of the sensations.\" - John Tan, early 2010 after my I AM realization\n\"(10:33 PM) Thusness: Self inquiry is a form of meditation like koan. The purpose is to have a direct\nexperience of our inner most essence called 'Self'. The next step is to bring this 'Self' into the foreground.\nThat requires vipassana meditation. It is the key towards non-dual. Even after non-dual, we have to\npractice vipassana but the focus is in being 'bare'. By being 'bare', it becomes mirror like, pristine, clear\nand luminous.\n(10:45 PM) Thusness: the next step is to bring this [Presence] into the foreground by practicing bare\nattention of our body sensations.\n(12:38 AM) Thusness: When we first experience the Eternal Witness, it is non-dual, presence, very\nreal, it is the Reality. at that moment the experience is non-dual. When we come to understand it, it\nbecomes dual. We understood it wrongly but we think that it is right. Therefore it appears to be 'there',\nstill, unchanging, wherever is. In actual fact, we are abstracting the characteristics of 'pristine clarity' from\na moment of arising and call it Presence. It is the mind doing the abstraction.\n(12:40 AM) Thusness: this is a tendency that is dividing. That is why vipassana is taught. Observing\nall arising sensation.\n249\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(12:40 AM) Thusness: that sensation is already Awareness itself. otherwise, self enquiry instead of\nvipassana would be taught and there is no point observing sensation. To be bare is to understand\nsensation in its pristineness, its luminosity that when it is bare. yet it is impermanent.\" - John Tan, 2009\nSee John's Vipassana - https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/thusnesss-vipassana.html and\nVipassana - https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/09/vipassana.html and read this book Gesture\nof Awareness\nEckhart Tolle describing the intensity of luminosity in the body in The Power of Now: “Connecting With\nThe Inner Body\nPlease try it now. You may find it helpful to close your eyes for this practice. Later on, when \"being in the\nbody' has become natural and easy, this will no longer be necessary. Direct your attention into the body.\nFeel it from within. Is it alive? Is there life in your hands, arms, legs, and feet - in your abdomen, your\nchest? Can you feel the subtle energy field that pervades the entire body and gives vibrant life to every\norgan and every cell? Can you feel it simultaneously in all parts of the body as a single field of energy?\nKeep focusing on the feeling of your inner body for a few moments. Do not start to think about it. Feel it.\nThe more attention you give it, the clearer and stronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell\nis becoming more alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your body\nbecoming luminous. Although such an image can help you temporarily, pay more attention to the feeling\nthan to any image that may arise. An image, no matter how beautiful or powerful, is already defined in\nform, so there is less scope for penetrating more deeply.\nThe feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable. You can always go into it more\ndeeply. If you cannot feel very much at this stage, pay attention to whatever you can feel. Perhaps there is\njust a slight tingling in your hands or feet. That's good enough for the moment. Just focus on the feeling.\nYour body is coming alive. Later, we will practice some more. Please open your eyes now, but keep some\nattention in the inner energy field of the body even as you look around the room. The inner body lies at\nthe threshold between your form identity and your essence identity, your true nature. Never lose touch\nwith it.”\nJohn Tan replied in 2006, “The experience comes when the 'self' subsides and awareness is experienced\nas a vibrantly luminous bright clarity. The radiance of pure awareness creates a powerful sense of\nPresence that is experienced in the form of aliveness and clarity in all parts of the body. If you were to\nvisualize it, it is like a very powerful inner light radiating out from nowhere to everywhere making\neverything that comes into contact alive.”\nJohn Tan, early August 2010:\n(12:49 AM) Thusness: do you feel like a luminous light?\n250\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(12:50 AM) AEN: yes, awareness is radiant and present\n(12:50 AM) Thusness: u need to lose that sense of self first. you will not feel like radiance light with\nyour current realization [Soh: that was spoken during my I AM phase of realization], only when you\nmature impersonality and non-dual. how did dharma dan describe pce?\n(1:32 AM) AEN: i think he said something like pure delight in the senses, the physical, etc. i think he\nalso talked about no sense of movement or fluxing?\n(1:33 AM) Thusness: he said radiance, brilliance and luminous. the senses and physical. when the\nbackground and foreground are both experienced as so. there will be radiance throughout, then it is\npossible to talk about luminous radiance. otherwise what you experience is still far from it. there must be\ntotal transparency, and there be the experience of purity, primordial, radiance in whatever arises. you\nmay also visualize radiance light vitalizing all your cells like what eckhart tolle said.\n(1:37 AM) AEN: oic.. what eckhart tolle said is like non dual?\n(1:37 AM) Thusness: yes. but he isn't clear about that, though the experience is there\n[Comments by Soh: Eckhart Tolle's insight is more into I AM, Thusness Stage 1 and 2]\nJohn TanThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:21pm UTC+10\ndo you have the experience of a transparent inner emanation?\nSoh Wei YuThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:21pm UTC+10\ndo you mean outwards emanation? or something else\nJohn TanThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:22pm UTC+10\nyeah, like a transparent energetic glowing light emanating outward?\nSoh Wei YuThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:29pm UTC+10\ntransparent luminosity yeah\nJohn TanThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:29pm UTC+10\nactually you don't need to meditate...just mature your insights and experience in daily activities [Soh:\nimportant - this comment was made 2+ years after my anatta realization, so do note that the I AM\nrealization is insufficient to experience nondual luminosity in all manifestations in an effortless manner]\nif it becomes stable...visualize light and experience that taste as a skillful practice\nSoh Wei YuThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:30pm UTC+10\nhow to visualize light\nJohn TanThursday, May 30, 2013 at 10:31pm UTC+10\n251\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nnot how...you must have that taste...like inner light emanating out... like a form of radiance...then\nvisualize that as if it is healing your entire being and body, into boundlessness as a skillful way of practice\n“Soh Wei Yu\n021haS0h7cnsorfe9 ·\nShared with Your friends\nThis is one of the four aspects of I AM, that John and I call 'intensity of luminosity'...\n\"One of the ways Brilliancy is useful for the Work of essential realization relates to intensity, or amplitude.\nWhen essential presence has the aspect of Brilliancy, you experience that the voltage is suddenly raised in\nall the processes going on inside you. Brilliancy gives a radiance to all manifestations, including your mind\nand body. Your processes become more radiant, more brilliant, which means that they become purer and\nmore themselves. When Brilliancy is experienced and realized, one’s process accelerates. It has a\nmagnifying effect, an empowering effect, on everything within your field. It is as if your essence were\ngetting a shot in the arm. It makes everything more alive, more luminous, and in a sense, more itself.\nEverything functions better, more efficiently, more accurately, more to the point. Brilliancy exists on its\nown—it independently functions as intelligence —but it also magnifies the functioning of everything else.\nAnd yet what characterizes the actual nature of Brilliancy is its direct presence in the soul, which then\nmanifests in the thoughts and actions of that person in the world.\" - A H Almaas, Brilliancy: the Essence of\nIntelligence (I was reading a sample of this book - the first two chapters today and I particularly copied out\nthis excerpt, and then later I found out this same exact excerpt can be found here\nhttps://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/brilliancy)\nThis book is still more of the I AM and one mind sort of understanding, unlike his most recent books\nwhich talks about anatta and total exertion also.\n1 Comment\nSoh Wei Yu\nLuminous Intelligence\nThe true essential quality of Brilliancy is a living quality to the consciousness that is aware and present.

It\ncan result in the oceanic experience. So although it is a pitfall that prevents effortless and non-dual\nexperience of Presence (this requires deeper insights) and is a form of efforting, abiding in Presence\nthrough samadhi is a form of development after I AM realization. But once one focuses on the 4 aspects\ndiscussed here, one will have that experience of oceanic Presence too.\n“How still, how silent, how oceanic and immense is that moment of authentication of I AM is crucial.”\n- John Tan, 2020\nOn the other hand, attempting to re-confirm the ever-presence of Awareness through reasoning (reasoning\nto oneself that Presence-Awareness is always here regardless of what experiences arise) is a retrogression\nfrom the I AM realization (which is direct certainty without inference), instead of any kind of development.\nThe following conversation explains why.\nConversation with John Tan while Soh was in his I AM phase:\n“John Tan: what is the difference before and after the realization of \"I AM\"?\n253\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSoh: a non conceptual certainty that does not come from inference, words, concepts\n*certainty of being\nJohn Tan: This certainty is unshakeable at that moment of realization.\nComplete, Done, Still, Perfect, Pure, non-dual , Non-conceptual, primordial\nSoh: yea\nJohn Tan: Yet it doesn't seem 'there' anymore. Though intuitively it can't be lost, but this clarity despite the\nrealization does not stay.\nSoh: yeah..\nJohn Tan: why so?\nSoh: Because of conceptual thoughts... the I AM experience is a non conceptual direct authentication, just\nabiding as that\nJohn Tan: why does conceptual thought arise?\nSoh: By habit mostly\nJohn Tan: now... have you seen through the illusion and power of 'thoughts'?\nSoh: I can see that thoughts are illusory... yet when I get lost in thoughts it still seems real and powerful.\nThat’s why suffering still arise\nJohn Tan: I remember reading something you said you read somewhere.. that the only problem is 'thought'.\nBecause it becomes a 'reality' to the mind. Suggestion is very real to the mind to consciousness, so how\ndoes problem arise? This is important… if you can't understand this, it is difficult for you to progress and\nunderstand deeper. You cannot have 'problems' if you do not react to the content of 'thoughts'...\nSoh: yeah.. we invest meaning and invest identity to our thoughts. I wrote about 'What's wrong with right\nnow unless you think about it?'. It’s when we label and give meaning to things that there are problems,\notherwise there are just wordless vibrations, even thoughts are wordless\nJohn Tan: yes, and problems includes confusions. Now in the direct mode, is there confusion?\nSoh: no\nJohn Tan: Is any explanation needed?\nSoh: no\nJohn Tan: Is any re-confirmation needed?\nSoh: no\nJohn Tan: Now if I were to ask you about source, is there any differentiation in that mode? You do not\ndifferentiate between source or you. There is no such differentiation… but when you are out of that mode,\nyou seek explanation. You attempt to re-confirm, and your way is by explaining to yourself. This very act\nitself already distant itself from the direct and immediate mode. Get it? You made the mistake after the\nrealization of \"I AM\". So does Mr. T. There is no why, no because,...no matter how logical it sounds, how\nmuch sense it makes, it is irrelevant, and from that [Soh: i.e. when comparing the logical reasoning process\nto direct realization] quality of experience in your realization, it is completely off the mark…\n...actually ramana maharshi only tell you to abide in the Self. There is no explanation, just the abiding.\nHowever, that is not the way though it is better than explanation… hahaha.\nIs surrendering a form of 'explanation'?\nSoh: no\n254\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nJohn Tan: It is just a quality of non-dual experience... a direct, immediate, non-dual, pure and non-\nconceptual experience that is still, complete and entire. Nothing matters in that mode. It is not about\nreading or no reading. If I don't explain to you, how are you to know? It is about getting into that mode and\nnot falling into the trap. If you want to re-live the experience, you cannot approach that way. Read my article\non anatta ( https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html ), I\nhave already said it must be a more direct mode. In hearing, just sound, this is an experiential fact. You\nmay describe the experience, you do not ask why in hearing, just sound. Or in hearing there is just sound\nbecause..... this and that… get it?”\nAs John Tan also wrote in 2009, “...Awakening to the ‘Watcher’ will at the same time ‘open’ the ‘eye of\nimmediacy’; that is, it is the capacity to immediately penetrate discursive thoughts and sense, feel, perceive\nwithout intermediary the perceived. It is a kind of direct knowing. You must be deeply aware of this “direct\nwithout intermediary” sort of perception -- too direct to have subject-object gap, too short to have time, too\nsimple to have thoughts. It is the ‘eye’ that can see the whole of ‘sound’ by being ‘sound’. It is the same ‘eye’\nthat is required when doing vipassana, that is, being ‘bare’. Be it non-dual or vipassana, both require the\nopening of this 'eye of immediacy'”.\n\"Question: Once again, I am trapped in mind trying to see and solve the mystery! The thing I am trying to\nunderstand is how awareness can see and recognize itself. But my conclusion is that it cannot. The only\nthing is to stay with the seeing and just be, and see the false as false.\nJohn Wheeler: Awareness—or what you are—is. It is a fact. You cannot doubt that you are, that you are\npresent. Being is. To try to know it, understand it, grasp it or express it is coming in at the mind level. It is a\nfalse game, because your very existence does not need to be known, understood or grasped. All of those\nactivities are going on ‘downstream’, within the non- conceptual awareness that you are. Who is trying to\nknow, understand and grasp? Only the assumed, fictitious ‘I’ itself.\nYou say, ‘The only thing is to stay with the seeing and just be, and see the false as false’. Who? The only\nthing — for whom? Who is to stay with seeing, when you are nothing but the seeing itself? Knock out any\nresidual reference to some separate ‘me’ and where is the problem and who has it? Your statement is really\na subtle reference to the old ghost of the ‘me’. You are not a ‘me’ with any task to do. You are non-\nconceptual existence-awareness itself now — and now — and now.\nIf the mind is looping, it is only doing so in the space of open awareness. No one is there, only this. You are\nthat.\" - Clear in Your Heart, John Wheeler, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0125/1442/t/2/assets/clear-in-\nyour-heart-sample.pdf\nAditya Prasad\nIf it makes you feel any better, I've been stuck in \"I AM\" for over three decades . After reading\n(parts of) AtR, I recognized another major trap I fell into: trying to continually reconfirm awareness.\nIt's deeply habitual now, and triggers itself when I'm trying to fall asleep, preventing me from\n255\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ngetting restful sleep. Really grateful for this group, because even though it's taking a long time to\nwork through this stuff, I don't know of any other resource that explains it.\n5\nTony Taylor\nAuthor\nAditya Prasad Yea I’m 44 so 3 decades for me as well\n1\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nAditya Prasad Due to lack of insight into the nature of awareness, the mind always has the sense\nthat awareness is behind, an unexamined belief that \"awareness is not thought, is not sleep, is not\nthis and that experience\" and that \"awareness is what is BEHIND them\", so it always attempts to\njump out of that moment of experience to find this 'familiar background' which is a mind made\nillusion. It is really just a line, a definition, a mind made map that attempts to locate awareness as\n'not that but this', 'not there but here', etc.\nWhen insight into nature of awareness arise, then one is able to overcome the tendency of\nlocating awareness anywhere besides manifestation. Then you will love to just sleep when you\nsleep, in hearing just sound, in sleeping just sleep, because that's always what's already the case --\nnever a seer or a seeing besides.\nAfter that 'confirmation' is always auto confirmation by the ten thousand things and auto release\n(self liberation) upon arising, in fact non arising in its arising. There is absolutely no effort to\nreconfirm anything necessary what has no who, no where, no when, non local but ever brilliant\nand spontaneous, without center, division, location or boundaries, all vivid manifestations as\nspontaneous presence.\nJoel Agee, 2013:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../joel-agee...\nHere are two sentences from one of the oldest Dzogchen texts, The All-Creating Monarch (Kunjed\nGyalpo) quoted in Longchenpa's Precious Treasury of the Way of Abiding (Richard Barron's\ntranslation):\n“Seek the location of the heart essence through phenomena that derive from it\nand come to appreciate it through the skillful means of not conceptualizing in any way whatsoever.\nSince the heart essence occurs naturally, dharmakaya is not elsewhere.”\nComing across these lines had a vividly awakening effect on me.\nLike · · Unfollow Post · September 2, 2012 at 1:29pm\nDannon Flynn, Steven Monaco, Neony Karby and 6 others like this.\n256\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nJoel Agee Simple but profound and ongoing: a deconstruction of an unconscious habit of locating\nawareness anywhere else than in the moment-to-moment transient phenomena.

Greater appreciation of what shows up\nfrom moment to moment, a kind of energy of being available for anything. More spontaneous\nease in action and speech and thought. But in a way this is all secondary. The recognition of\nawareness is unobstructed. Sometimes it seems to be obscured by thoughts and feelings, and\nthen it's obvious that those too are the clarity and the emptiness.

But this aspect will require further insights (into non-dual, anatta and empty nature -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html) to unfold and\nmature much further.\nThird and fourth point is especially clear after realization of anatta (No-Self, as elucidated in the latter part\nof this document):\n259\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“There is no one who has ever known the essence of awareness. There is no one has ever rested in the\npresence of awareness. Such is only concept and concept can not cross the threshold of wisdom.\nExpanse and eveness are their ownmost and admit no one, no realizer, no Buddha, no being ........ no one\ncan enter therein and yet not only is no one excluded but no thing no time no presence has ever strayed\nor wavered from ……..\nIdentity does not rest within but resolves….. and the absence of all conceptuality 'about' is known as\nabsence of identity of beings of Buddhas. Devoid of reification, within this eveness, all appearances, all\nbodies, all thought abides non-other than ownmostness’ uncompounded and uncontrived essence.\nWhat is talked about when we speak of the essence of awareness is not mere intellectualization, abstract\nphilosophizing but is directly realized in the unutterableness of contemplative practice's deep and concept\nfree eveness.\nOne does not come to abide in this realization. The fact that there is no such one at all is realized long\nbefore the eveness of essence is known. One does not come to abide in this state but instead realizes that\nin fact no-thing has ever strayed from it.\nWhen this is realized then body and mind are informed by, and animate the truth of ………” - Traktung\nRinpoche (from recent talks on ineffability)\n“Hi AEN,\nI do not usually reply people about spiritual stuff but I sense the confusion in Mikael's mail to you.\nIt is advisable to correctly point out to him that there is no short cut to direct path.\nIn the most direct path, Awareness is already and always at rest. In the most direct path, whatever\nmanifests is Awareness; there is no \"in Awareness\" and there is no such thing as going deeper in Awareness\nor resting in Awareness. Anything \"going deeper\" or \"resting\" is nothing direct. Nothing more than the\nillusionary appearances of 'hierarchy' caused by the inherent and dualistic tendency of understanding\nthings.\nIt is more 'gradual' than 'direct'. Therefore have the right view first before we talk too much about the\ndirect path so that we do not fall into such views.

Shouldn't effortlessness (4)\njust be the result of dissolving the need to return (3)?\nSoh Wei Yu: (3) is about uncontrivance.\n(4) is about effortlessness, spontaneous emergence of presence.\nOne is telling you to stop creating karma. The other is telling you the effortless spontaneity of presence.\nBut all these are difficult without the correct insights... but still, we have to practice in this way as a means\nof imitating what life is like in anatta.

(3)\nBut effortlessness (4) reaches full maturity in later phase of spontaneous presence. Thats how it is for me.\nThen concentrative mode is not necessary.\nThe (2) aspect of intensity of luminosity also varies even after anatta.\nBecause JK is stuck at concentrative mode of anatta instead of maturing it into spontaneous presence, his\nover exertion in PCE mode caused life long energy imbalances and pain. Kundalini issues.\n…\nIts interesting that John Tan said sleeplessness [faced by some people like Mr. A. P. and John Tan back in\nhis I AM days] will be solved at stage 5.5. I think 5 to 5.5 is the phase where anatta turns from subtly\nconcentrative to effortless and spontaneous presence. Energy and tension in overfocusing on the details\nrelease, all effort releases into selfless spontaneity.”\n-------------\nBesides contemplating on the Four Aspects of I AM and the two stanzas of anatta in 2) On Anatta (No-\n262\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSelf), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection. and the Two Types of Nondual\nContemplation after I AM\nIt is also good to go through the following links consisting of early days conversation between John Tan\nand other forummers like Sim Pern Chong.

In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference\nto the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When for you there will be\nonly the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in\nreference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bāhiya, there is no\nyou in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there.\nWhen there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is\nthe end of stress.\"\nSoh’s breakthrough to Anatta realization came about through the contemplation of Bahiya Sutta as\nhe described in\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html\nAlso see Ajahn Amaro’s article and John’s comments below:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html\nAlso related and important: The Two Stanzas of Anatta in On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness,\nMaha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection by John Tan\nSomeone asked, \"How do you do this? I just end up repeating the words over and over again. Or\nfocusing on trying to see clearly what the [two] stanzas [of anatta] are saying and getting a little\ntense lol. Should I just observe in a relaxed state and try to directly perceive the stanzas? Did you\nrequire samadhi for a breakthrough or just persistence?\"\nSoh replied, \"for me there was an element of investigation\nseeing if awareness existed as some standalone seer or seeing besides colors and so on, challenging\nthem and investigating until these constructs are seen through and there is direct realisation that\nawareness is precisely these appearances, sensations, always already so\nmore an investigation but meditation can help\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2015/12/self-liberation-by-khamtrul-rinpoche-iii.html\n\"At that point, is the observer—awareness—other than the observed—stillness and movement—or\nis it actually that stillness and movement itself? By investigating with the gaze of your own awareness,\nyou come to understand that that which is investigating itself is also no other than stillness and\nmovement. Once this happens you will experience lucid emptiness as the naturally luminous self-\n264\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nknowing awareness. Ultimately, whether we say nature and radiance, undesirable and antidote,\nobserver and observed, mindfulness and thoughts, stillness and movement, etc., you should know\nthat the terms of each pair are no different from one another; by receiving the blessing of the guru,\nproperly ascertain that they are inseparable. Ultimately, to arrive at the expanse free of observer\nand observed is the realization of the true meaning and the culmination of all analyses. This is called\n“the view transcending concepts,” which is free of conceptualization, or “the vajra mind view.”\"\nBreakthroughs to Anatta\nTwo persons realised anatta recently in AtR group:\nJayson MPaul shared:\nHello friends. I have been reading the blog for a few years now. It was suggested to me back in 2017 on the\nDhO, but I wasn't ready for it. Looking back I was definitely in stage 1 and I can trace my way through the\nfirst 4 stages. Something dawned on me 2 days ago and all things became unstuck. It became clear to me\nthat every moment is just the thoughts, scenery, sounds. Nothing has ever been obscured! I was trying to\nfind what I was missing but then it dawned that I was missing the fact that \"searching for what was missing\"\nis also just thought, sensation, manifestation. I still very subtly believed I was a non-dual awareness having\na non-dual experience. I was trying to expand awareness to include more and more sensations. The size\nisn't the problem, it is realizing that there isn't anything more than just this and digging up subtler and\nsubtler views that support this reification of awareness as a formless thing or ground of all experience. The\nlast couple days have been effortlessly no-mind because all experiences are and always were no-mind.\nFinally most of the words on your blog speak to my direct experience. Thank you for the pointers!\nTd Unmanifest shared:\nSoh Wei Yu suggested I post something about my experience after our email conversation.\nI emailed to thank him and John Tan for their writings, resources, and pointers that have helped me\nimmensely in my progress.\nMany years ago I had a powerful, \"accidental\" I Am experience that compelled me to search for what it was\nand how to make it permanent. Over the years I have explored many teachers, practices, systems, and\ntechniques. Some more helpful than others.\nI actually encountered AtR several years ago via a DhO post, but honestly aside from some of the I Am posts\nand discussions, none of it made much sense to me. I now know that's due to the fact I was stuck in the I\nAm phase, yet I thought I was much further along in my progress.\n265\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nEarlier this year, I rediscovered AtR, and began to read and study the Journal and Guide, along with the\nassociated posts. It all was much clearer to me this time -- maybe I was more ripe for the teachings now\nRealizing I had been stuck in I Am, I followed the recommendations from the guide. The contemplation of\n\"where awareness ends and manifestation begins\" was especially helpful and propelled me into a nondual\nrealization. It was all very clear. The luminosity and clarity, descriptions, and experience, all lined up with\nwhat was written. It was extremely helpful to have my insights and experiences line up with writings from\nsomeone who had been down the path. The insight/shift from no-mind, to anatta was the most powerful,\nyet ordinary thing. As I said in my email to Soh Wei Yu:\nThough the earlier anatta experience shifted to a \"no center, no background\" emptiness of no-self, there\nwas still a sense of a doer. This current shift/experience has left the doer and the \"agencylessness\" seems\nthe default view.\nDogen's Uji, and the insights of being-time have also been very powerful for me, along with Tozen's \"place\nwhere there is no cold or heat,\" which was recommended by Soh Wei Yu. It's amazing how the suttas and\nteachers make so much sense now and help clarify and stabilize realization and insight.\nJust writing this short post, it's difficult to describe these insights. It makes me appreciate how well the AtR\nteam and other teachers have been able to describe and present the material in a clear way.\n...\nTD Unmanifest:\nI got stuck in I AM for a long time due to clinging to dissociation and the experience as Soh mentioned\nabove. The focus was almost entirely on the mind. When I shifted to other sense doors (hearing in particular)\nsomething \"popped\" and the nondual experience moved from mind to body to everything (not really the\nbest description, but the only way I can think to explain it). Contemplation on where the nondual Self ended\nand manifestation begins shifted my experience again, and began the process to a taste of no-mind then\nto annata.\nThe issue wasn't the dissociation, it was the clinging to the experience that was taken to be something more\ntranscendental than it was. This stuff is hard to explain, so hope that makes some sense\nLabels: Anatta, Jayson MPaul, Td Unmanifest |\nAlso see the Wind Metaphor and Weather Metaphor in STAGE 5 below.\n2011: (1:07 AM) Thusness: when you first experience I AM, what you think is your next phase?\n266\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(1:07 AM) AEN: the four phases or aspects of I AM? impersonality, etc\n(1:08 AM) Thusness: no i mean you yourself\n(1:15 AM) AEN: oh to constantly abide in I AM\n(1:15 AM) Thusness: that would be a state of perfection to you isn't it?\n(1:15 AM) AEN: yea\n(1:16 AM) Thusness: but that would be quite impossible. :P and requires deep concentration and focus\nhowever when you realized non-dual, what happened?\n(1:23 AM) AEN: it becomes rather effortless and is not a matter of sustaining a samadhi state\n(1:24 AM) Thusness: you realized that instead of abiding, non-dual is the key. so your next focus is non-\ndual, how to make it seamless. then you realized anatta\n(1:24 AM) AEN: yea\n(1:25 AM) Thusness: and you realized the key to perfection of non-dual. then you are now perfecting\nthe anatta. all is about the same taste throughout. and you refine understanding and view accordingly\n(1:30 AM) AEN: ic.. yea\nSamadhi (Meditative Absorption)\nRamana Maharshi:\n\"In samadhi, there is only the feeling 'I am' and no thoughts.\n\"See to whom the trouble is. It is to the 'I-thought'. Hold it. Then the other thoughts vanish.\"\n\"When these thoughts are dispelled, you remain in the state of meditation, free from thoughts.\"\n\"The limited and multifarious thoughts having disappeared, there shines in the Heart a kind of\nwordless illumination of 'I-I', which is pure consciousness.\"\nThe I AM or Pure Presence turns oceanic and can be intensely blissful when one has deepened meditative\nsamadhi, a prime modern example being Ramana Maharshi who can sit for days in Nirvikalpa Samadhi or\na thoughtless state of Self-Abidance in Pure Presence without leaving his seat, although you do not need\nto go to such extremes. Even contemporary teachers like Eckhart Tolle spent years sitting in meditative\nabsorption and bliss of Self in a park after initial Self-Realization. However, entering a state of samadhi is\nnot the same as Self-Realization, it can simply be an experience.\nSome training in samadhi (a daily meditation practice is important in any phase of one’s practice) even after\nSelf-Realization can be a good complementary practice both in this phase and for future phases, but it is\neven more important to focus on the four aspects of I AM and two nondual contemplations for further\nadvancement.\nIn many cases, including John Tan, one can spend years cultivating deep samadhi in the I AM phase before\ncultivating any further insights into non-dual, anatta and emptiness. In Soh’s case, due to being familiar\n267\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nwith certain pointers and a map, he progressed from I AM to Anatta realization in less than a year even\nbefore mastery of samadhi was developed. One can get stuck in I AM for decades or a whole life abiding in\nSamadhi without any further progress of insights; or one can get speedy insights, but needs to cultivate\nsamadhi further later.\nOne other possibility is that a practitioner develops both the Wisdom and Samadhi aspect in tandem, such\nthat there is no need for a ‘catching up’ of the other aspect later on. (Related: Buddha’s teachings in\nYuganaddha Sutta) In either case, eventually both Samadhi and Wisdom, Shamatha and Vipassana need to\nbe conjoined and perfected for total liberation and bliss. Maha Total Exertion in the latter phase comes\nwith the aspect of samadhi.\n“Total exertion is shamatha and vipassana into one. It is total focus and involvement of the entire body-\nmind, of everything. However that requires post-anatta insight.” - John Tan, 2019\nJohn Tan wrote in August 2010 to me while I had initial nondual breakthroughs after I AM realization,\n“Bringing Non-Dual to Foreground\nHi AEN,\nSaw your enlistment date in your facebook, good luck to you! 3 weeks is a short period so start working\non your physical fitness before the enlistment. There are certain fitness expectations for basic combat\ntraining, for guys they must at least able to perform 13 push-ups and 17 sit-ups in a minute and run one\nmile within 8:30 minutes. You are, of course, expected to do much better than that.\nIt is also appropriate at this juncture to talk about your recent realization of the ‘Eternal Witness’. I am\nglad that you are clear on the part about experience and realization through direct experiential insight, it\nis an invaluable insight. After this, you are very much on your own and the ‘taste’ of a pure, original,\nprimordial, non-conceptual and non-dual luminous state of existence will serve as an internal compass\nfor you. Treasure it!\nAfter the initial realization, there is a strong desire to ‘relive’ the experience -- this pure sense of existence;\nin fact the mind wishes the experience be made permanent and it is not uncommon that practitioners\nperceive the permanent, natural and effortless abiding of this state as ‘Nirvana’. Therefore it is a natural\nprogression for you to seek permanent abiding in the Self as a background at this point in time. If you\nintensify your meditation and abide in the Self, an oceanic blissful experience may arise as a result of\ndeep absorption but it is still a contrived effort, it is not the ‘key’ towards effortlessness. Nonetheless\nhaving a ‘taste’ of deep Samadhi bliss and understanding the relationship between deep concentration\nand this oceanic bliss is still crucial.\nHaving said that, since none of your recent posts are about the absorptive state but are experiences\n268\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nrelating to non-dual in transience, it is appropriate to practice bringing this ‘taste’ of pure luminous\nbrilliance to the foreground. By ‘foreground’, I am referring to all your six entries and exits (eyes, ears,\nnose, tongue, body and mind) and experience vivid luminous aliveness in colors, forms, shape, sound,\nscent, taste and thoughts. It is essential for Phase 4 and 5 insights, that is, experiencing directly the 18\ndhatus and aggregates and realize that the entire idea of 'I and Mine' is learnt. Also, I do not think you\nhave the time to practice deep absorptive meditation in army. You can re-visit this ‘Oceanic Samadhi Bliss’\nlater when there is thoroughness and fearlessness in forgoing the sense of self/Self.\nThe universe is this arising thought.\nThe universe is this arising sound.\nJust this magnificent arising!\nIs Tao.\nHomage to all arising.\nDoing this foreground practice, you are effectively refining your realization from “You as pure\nExistence” to “Existence is the very stuff of whatever arises”. The actual stuff - the screen, the\nkeyboard, the clicking sound, the cool air, the taste, the vibration…is the actuality of Universe itself, there\nis no other. Nevertheless do take note that these are still experiences, they are not realizations. You will\nhave to go through what you have gone through in the phase of ‘I AM’ from intermittent experiences to\nrealizations.\nI have read some of the articles written by Richard, they are very well written and will be of great help in\nthis 'foreground' practice. There are values in the teachings of Actual Freedom but there is no need to\nover-claim anything. In my opinion, saying what that is more than necessary does not make one superior.\nAlso do not get overwhelmed by the vivid luminous brilliance that manifests as the background source or\nforeground phenomena, let go of all; much like lamas building a sand mandala that is so vivid, colorful\nand beautiful, is destroyed immediately after it is completed. It is not just about the 'brilliant luminosity', it\nis also about the 'Gone'; therefore vividly present and instantly gone -- GATE GATE PARAGATE\nPARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA.\nLastly be sincere to the deeper dispositions, they reveal more about us more than the ‘surface’\nachievements, not to take it lightly. You are a sincere guy so allow your sincerity and your realizations be\nyour inner guides -- they are your only ‘true teachers’, I am not. :-)\nLabels: Anatta, John Tan, Non Dual, Non-dual | “\nAlso, as explained earlier, the I AM realization is not a maintenance state. Furthermore it is also not\nsomething that one can only “experience” during a state of meditative trance at a faraway mountain\nshielded from daily life. Someone who realized I AM will come to understand, as John Tan puts it in 2007,\n“AMness has limitless potential and must be expressed in a relative world in constant interaction.” As the\nsource and ground of everything, AMness is seen to have infinite potentiality to express in, through and\n269\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nas everything. I have seen many who have realized I AM yet remain pretty grounded in their everyday life,\nthey treat daily life as practice and as a way to express their realization of I AMness even though they\nhave not had deeper realisations into non-duality, anatta or emptiness. As John Tan said in 2007,\ngrounding one’s insights into daily living is not indicative or equivalent to the depth of insights, yet in each\nphase of insight one’s realisations should be actualized and grounded in our daily living as a practice.\nOn the other hand, people, particularly the Neo-Advaitins, advocate no further need for meditation and\npractices after (or even before) some initial I AM or nondual breakthrough. Don’t listen to these naive\nstatements.\n“Don't listen to people saying (that there’s) no need for meditation. These are people with only small\nattainment and realisation.” - John Tan, 2007\n“Sometimes people will think that they understand these Teachings and think that because they think they\nunderstand them, they don't need to sit zazen and to actually practise and embody the teachings. But as\nEihei Dogen zenji says in the Fukanzazengi, \"Just suppose you become puffed up about your understanding\nand inflate your little experiences: You think you have seen the truth, attained the Way, recognized the\nluminosity of mind and can grasp at heaven. You might think that these initial jaunts about the borders are\nentering the realm of enlightenment but you've lost the Way of complete liberation.\" It's like just getting\nthe tip of your toe wet - not even the whole toe - because you think it's safer to keep your distance from it.\nIf you really understood the first thing about these Teachings, there is no way that you could justify not\nsitting zazen.” - Ven. Jinmyo Renge osho https://wwzc.org/dharma-text/transparent\n“Although Buddha was endowed with natural knowledge, he sat in zazen for six years. Bodhidharma\nbequeathed us the legacy of the Buddha- mind, yet still sat facing a wall for nine years. Such were the\nancient sages. Why can we not practice like them? Therefore, desist from pur- suing words and letters\nintellectually and reflect upon your self inwardly. Thus your body and mind shall be cast off naturally and\nyour original nature (honrai no memmoku) shall be realized. If you wish to attain it, be diligent in zazen at\nonce.” - Zen Master Dogen\n“Once, when Jōshū was addressing his assembly, he said: For thirty years, I lived in the south intent on\nnothing but doing seated meditation. If any of you wish to realize the One Great Matter,*you will encounter\nIt by pursuing the principle of doing seated meditation. If after three years, or five years, or twenty years,\nor even thirty years, you can still say that you have not realized the Truth, take the skull of this old monk\nand make it into a pot to piss in. That is the kind of vow he took. Truly, doing the practice of seated\nmeditation is the straight road of the Buddha’s Way. We should follow the principle of “Just sit and you shall\nsee what happens.” Later, people would say of him, “Jōshū was truly an Old Buddha.”” - Zen Master Dogen\n“As my Master also said, all the Buddhas, as well as all the Ancestors, have kept to the Buddha Dharma as\nTheir dwelling place. One and All have not only sat upright in Their meditative state of delight in the Truth,\n270\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nbut They have also put the Precepts into practice, and thus They have taken this combination as the precise\nand certain way for awakening to the Truth. Those in India and China who have experienced an awakening\nhave likewise conformed to this approach. This is based on Master directly passing on to disciple, in private,\nthis wondrous method, and the latter preserving its genuine inner meaning.\nWhen we speak of the correct Transmission in our tradition, the straightforward Buddha Teaching of direct\nTransmission is ‘the best of the best’. From the very moment when a disciple comes to meet face-to-face\nwith the one who is to be his spiritual friend and knowing teacher, there is no need to have the disciple\noffer incense, make prostrations, chant the names of the Buddhas, do ascetic practices and penances, or\nrecite Scriptures: the Master just has the disciple do pure meditation until he lets his body and mind drop\noff. Even though it may be merely for a moment, when someone, whilst sitting upright in meditation, puts\nthe mark of the Buddha seal upon his three types of volitional actions—namely, those of body, speech and\nthought—the whole physical universe and everything in it becomes and is the Buddha seal; all of space,\nthroughout, becomes and is enlightenment.” - Zen Master Dogen\n““Now, if anyone would develop these four establishings of mindfulness in this way for seven years, one of\ntwo fruits can be expected for him: either gnosis right here & now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-\nsustenance—non-return.\n“Let alone seven years.

One must experience\nthe luminosity with the condition of opening eyes, walking, every movement, but only for one that is\nready. Many zen practitioners thought that they already there, but they are not. Unless one has\nexperienced non-dual and go to the finer aspects until quite a certain level, then it is appropriate. Many\nonly reside at stage 1 and 2, and start talking about meditation not being needed. This is not correct. I\nwould say only until (one reaches) 5.5 in terms of direct path then one is fit to say that, then practice is\neverywhere.” - John Tan, 2007\n271\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nJohn also shared before, “So meditation is everywhere and in every activity. That said, still sit and don't act\nsmart. And exercise.“\nKyle Dixon shared on reddit something that John Tan and I liked:\nJean-Luc Achard on Integration of the View and the Role of Diligence in Relation to the Key Points of\nTrekcho\nIt is actually pretty easy to enter the experience of rigpa but more difficult to cultivate it without artifice,\noutside of a retreat context. Most of the westerners I know do not do any retreat. They go to teachings\nwhen a lama is there and they call it a retreat. I’ve received a lot of teachings in Tibet and none of the\nmasters ever said a word about integration into daily working life. This is something that a few Tibetan\nmasters have made for the west. Traditionally, when you receive a Dzogchen teaching, you then go into\nretreat and generate some experience. This takes months at best. Then you come back to the master and\nrelate your experience. Then you get further details on more advanced practice, etc., and you go into\nanother retreat. So not doing any “real” retreat is probably a drawback that affects most people. For\ninstance, the retreat of trekchö in the Kunzang Nyinthik (its the same for those who follow the Yeshe\nLama for instance) does not last less than 18 continuous months in a traditional context.\nAnother point that is related is misunderstanding some key points in trekchö. For instance, all our\nmasters repeat that once you have entered the state of trekchö, then you must not do anything. And you\nconsequently have people not doing anything for years! They just remain like that, glued in a state of total\nblankness, using vague words like “presence” to describe the actual fogginess of their experience.\nActually, what texts say is that you don’t do anything at first, not continually. “At first” means that it’s\nsimply the threshold of trekchö practice. What you actually have to do is once you don’t doubt anymore\nregarding the actual “flavor” of this state, then you have to cultivate it with artifice during specific sessions\n(that’s the purpose of the 18 months mentioned above) after which you are quasi-certain to reach a non-\nregressive stability in this state. Most of the time, this stability is reached quite earlier during the retreat.\nIt’s actually easier to succeed in this during a retreat than during the daily working life when you have all\nthe distractions of your ordinary social life. So during the retreat, at a certain stage, you train in\nintegration. There are four things to integrate: (i) the activities of the three doors, (ii) the activities of the\nsix associations of consciousness, (iii) specific intellectual activities of the mind, and (iv) the variety of\ncircumstances that life puts on your path. So the “doing nothing” is really something for beginners in\ntrekchö. Most people I know mistake it for the real practice. That’s the worst mistake to make because\none is never going to make any progress if one goes on like this.\nThere are plenty of things to do. Rushen for instance in order to clearly deepen this knowledge and have\na direct experience that is not produced by our discursiveness. Then, the training of the 3 doors. Then\nspecific techniques such as the four natural accesses to properly access the state of trekchö. [One should\nnot think] there is nothing to do: there are things to do to enter this state, and once you’re in it you\ncultivate it by integrating other things (after having become familiarized with it). This appears to be not\nunderstood by all. When you are in this state, you just have to stabilize it. This takes the whole path to do\nso! Don’t bypass it because you don’t like it, it’s precisely like this, one has to practice, period. You may\nstate otherwise but this is not Dzogchen anymore. Once you are stable in the experience of the natural\nstate, you realize that this experience is uncompounded, unaltered, etc., and you don’t have to do\nanything to correct it. But in general, everyone (including our masters at a stage in their life) regresses\n272\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nfrom it. So one has to become familiar with it, through contemplation practice. But this contemplation\npractice is aimless if it just means sitting and doing nothing. That means each time you quit your sitting\nmeditation, you are regressing from that state.\nBut, if you want to integrate the natural state in a non-regressive way, you have to do something.\nTrekchö has to be done for very long sessions during specific retreats in total silence and isolation. The\nlonger the sessions, the deeper the experience grows until, like a sheet which constantly put into water\nnever dries, one does not regress anymore from the experience of the natural state.\n— Jean-Luc Achard”\nHow silent meditation helped me with nondual inquiry\nby Greg Goode in https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheDirectPathGroup\n(The Direct Path Group is for discussions related to Greg Goode and Sri Atmananda's teachings related to\nAdvaita Vedanta)\n= How silent meditation helped me with nondual inquiry =\nThis is about how silent meditation helped me with nondual inquiry. Silent meditation is different from\ninquiry, and helps prepare one for doing inquiry. It helps in several ways, which I’ll say more about below.\nThere are various forms of silent meditation and various paths of inquiry. For example, Shamatha is\nrecommended if one wants to realize emptiness via analytic meditation.\nPersonally, I found Zazen helpful for nondual inquiry. How can it help? It stabilizes the mind so that the\nmind doesn’t get off track or fall asleep during the inquiry.\nHere is a very rough and schematic quasi-Vedantic account of how this works. It’s not a DP account, but\nsomething that we were taught in the Chinmaya Mission. Vedanta looks at the body/mind apparatus as\ncomposed of various layers or sheaths of active energy. At the grossest is the body. At a more subtle layer\nis the “emotional body,” then the mind as controller of its activities. And more subtle still is the intellect,\nthe process of ratiocination, making connections and insight.\nAll activities engage all of the levels, but some activities have their center of gravity more on one level\nthan another. According to the present scheme, Nondual inquiry begins largely at the energetic level of\nthe intellect. But the insights permeate all levels. And nondual insights deconstruct the levels altogether.\nIn order that the intellect do its appointed job well, it needs to be somewhat calm. It cannot be jumpy or\ninclined to nod off into sleep.\nFor the intellect to be calm, the less subtle levels need to be somewhat calm as well. This is familiar - if\nthere is emotional turbulence, it is hard to think.\nThere are activities that address each of the levels. Such as karma yoga or recreational dancing or\nathletics for the physical level. Bhakti yoga or art or singing or performing music for the emotional level.\nRaja yoga or study or concentrated meditation for the level of controlling the mind. And jnana yoga or\nmathematics or other kinds of coursing stuff out for the intellectual level.\nThe calmer the levels that are less subtle than the intellect, the calmer the intellect will be able to be.\nThis is where zazen helped me. It came in at the level of the control-of-the-mind level and smoothed\nthings out wonderfully. Plus it gives a taste of silence. For me, it helped the mind stay with the subtleties\nof jnana yoga without a a rage of chattering thoughts, and without getting drowsy and falling asleep.\n273\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nZazen is taught at Zen centers. Phenomenally (not doctrinally) it is a process of keeping the mind\nextremely steady on a subtle object like counting or the breath. There are two things that could depart\nfrom that: a chatty mind or a sleepy one. Whenever you notice that either has happened, you simply go\nback to counting or following the breath.\nBesides calmness and stability and subtlety, I noticed physically healthy things, like better digestion, more\nenergy on the lower body and more closely focused in everything where needed.\nOne can do zazen earlier in the day, and then nondual inquiry later in the day. And nondual inquiry will be\nsupercharged. Of course there are other preparatory activities that will help. This was just my experiences\nwith zazen!\n...\nHi Andrej, Here are some examples of which inquiries were helped by Zazen.... I did years of inquiries,\nmostly before I did Zazen. The main inquiry I did with the aid of Zazen was later and extremely subtle: I\nwas looking into why Truth and Reality were widely held to be nondual whereas I experienced a very\nslight, benevolent duality between witnessing awareness and the arisings that seemed to arise from/to it.\nThere was no suffering (I was at the so-called \"transparent witness\" gestalt). But even so, I was drawn to\nthis issue for over a year. I happened to be doing Zazen at the time - I only realized later that it helped,\nand how it helped. How did Zazen help? I was already pretty good at focusing and keeping my attention\non an object. My father had this too. He brought it his work home and did it at the large dinner table\nwhile the TV was on a few feet away and we kids were running around. It didn't bug him a bit! He taught\nthis focus to us. We were a family of introverted artists, so it was easy. All my school, military and\ncorporate experience helped with focus as well. But this topic (subject/object distinction) was very\nslippery. In a word, Zazen helped make the mind more open and subtle. It quieted the mind so that it was\nmore open to subtle insight coming from unexpected angles, as opposed to the usual ones. And it helped\nthe mind recognize patterns and formulations of a vaguer and more subtle type. Here's a physicalist-type\nexample. Imagine putting a long hair in a phone book and then cover it with one page. Then shut your\neyes and try to trace the hair with your fingertips\n...\nKyle Dixon:\nSitting has been invaluable for me in my life, with positive, long lasting effects. I really cannot recommend\nit enough. Also the more I sat, and the more stable my meditation became, the brighter my mind became,\nlike increasing the brightness on a lamp. Energetically things became very coordinated, like Greg\nmentioned, and what I would call instances of transcendent insight would erupt spontaneously. Which\nwere like precursors to larger events of the same species. Meditation if done right is just a fantastic\nsupplement to any spiritual endeavor. It breathes life into the process and makes everything easier and\nmore enjoyable.\n…\nMr. A said: “That’s another thing, what would you need to practice for? your true nature is lacking nothing,\nso why supplement it with these meaningless practices? “\n274\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSoh replied:\nYour question is a good one, and since this is precisely the paramount question which drove Zen Master\nDogen's search to China and which culminated his great awakening, I'll paste this famous text as a\nresponse to your question as it seems appropriate:\nZen Master Dogen’s teachings on Zazen:\n“Fukan Zazengi (Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen)\nThe way is originally perfect and all-pervading. How could it be contingent on practice and realization?\nThe true vehicle is self-sufficient. What need is there for special effort? Indeed, the whole body is free\nfrom dust. Who could believe in a means to brush it clean? It is never apart from this very place; what is\nthe use of traveling around to practice? And yet, if there is a hairsbreadth deviation, it is like the gap\nbetween heaven and earth. If the least like or dislike arises, the mind is lost in confusion. Suppose you are\nconfident in your understanding and rich in enlightenment, gaining the wisdom that knows at a glance,\nattaining the Way and clarifying the mind, arousing an aspiration to reach for the heavens. You are\nplaying in the entranceway, but you are still short of the vital path of emancipation.\nConsider the Buddha: although he was wise at birth, the traces of his six years of upright sitting can yet\nbe seen. As for Bodhidharma, although he had received the mind-seal, his nine years of facing a wall is\ncelebrated still. If even the ancient sages were like this, how can we today dispense with wholehearted\npractice?\nTherefore, put aside the intellectual practice of investigating words and chasing phrases, and learn to take\nthe backward step that turns the light and shines it inward. Body and mind of themselves will drop away,\nand your original face will manifest. If you want to realize such, get to work on such right now.\nFor practicing Zen, a quiet room is suitable. Eat and drink moderately. Put aside all involvements and\nsuspend all affairs. Do not think \"good\" or \"bad.\" Do not judge true or false. Give up the operations of\nmind, intellect, and consciousness; stop measuring with thoughts, ideas, and views. Have no designs on\nbecoming a buddha. How could that be limited to sitting or lying down?\nAt your sitting place, spread out a thick mat and put a cushion on it. Sit either in the full-lotus or half-lotus\nposition. In the full-lotus position, first place your right foot on your left thigh, then your left foot on your\nright thigh. In the half-lotus, simply place your left foot on your right thigh. Tie your robes loosely and\narrange them neatly. Then place your right hand on your left leg and your left hand on your right palm,\nthumb-tips lightly touching. Straighten your body and sit upright, leaning neither left nor right, neither\nforward nor backward. Align your ears with your shoulders and your nose with your navel. Rest the tip of\nyour tongue against the front of the roof of your mouth, with teeth together and lips shut. Always keep\nyour eyes open, and breathe softly through your nose.\n275\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nOnce you have adjusted your posture, take a breath and exhale fully, rock your body right and left, and\nsettle into steady, immovable sitting. Think of not thinking, \"Not thinking --what kind of thinking is that?\"\nNonthinking. This is the essential art of zazen.\nThe zazen I speak of is not meditation practice. It is simply the dharma gate of joyful ease, the practice\nrealization of totally culminated enlightenment. It is the koan realized; traps and snares can never reach it.\nIf you grasp the point, you are like a dragon gaining the water, like a tiger taking to the mountains. For\nyou must know that the true dharma appears of itself, so that from the start dullness and distraction are\nstruck aside.\nWhen you arise from sitting, move slowly and quietly, calmly and deliberately. Do not rise suddenly or\nabruptly. In surveying the past, we find that transcendence of both mundane and sacred, and dying while\neither sitting or standing, have all depended entirely on the power of zazen.\nIn addition, triggering awakening with a finger, a banner, a needle, or a mallet, and effecting realization\nwith a whisk, a fist, a staff, or a shout --these cannot be understood by discriminative thinking; much less\ncan they be known through the practice of supernatural power. They must represent conduct beyond\nseeing and hearing. Are they not a standard prior to knowledge and views?\nThis being the case, intelligence or lack of it is not an issue; make no distinction between the dull and the\nsharp-witted. If you concentrate your effort single-mindedly, that in itself is wholeheartedly engaging the\nway.\nPractice-realization is naturally undefiled. Going forward is, after all, an everyday affair.\nIn general, in our world and others, in both India and China, all equally hold the buddha-seal. While each\nlineage expresses its own style, they are all simply devoted to sitting, totally blocked in resolute stability.\nAlthough they say that there are ten thousand distinctions and a thousand variations, they just\nwholeheartedly engage the way in zazen. Why leave behind the seat in your own home to wander in vain\nthrough the dusty realms of other lands? If you make one misstep, you stumble past what is directly in\nfront of you.\nYou have gained the pivotal opportunity of human form. Do not pass your days and nights in vain. You\nare taking care of the essential activity of the buddha-way. Who would take wasteful delight in the spark\nfrom a flintstone? Besides, form and substance are like the dew on the grass, the fortunes of life like a\ndart of lightning --emptied in an instant, vanished in a flash.\nPlease, honored followers of Zen, long accustomed to groping for the elephant, do not doubt the true\ndragon. Devote your energies to the way of direct pointing at the real. Revere the one who has gone\nbeyond learning and is free from effort. Accord with the enlightenment of all the buddhas; succeed to the\nsamadhi of all the ancestors. Continue to live in such a way, and you will be such a person. The treasure\nstore will open of itself, and you may enjoy it freely.” – Zen Master Dogen\n…\nOn sitting posture:\n276\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“Soh Wei Yu 1) Do not worry whether you are doing correctly, as long as you keep the Great Doubt\ngoing and do not get stuck on experiences. Silence or noise, stillness or thoughts, continue inquiring into\nthe Source.\n2) Preferable posture is full lotus which is what I do, if not half lotus is alright, if not burmese or sitting on\na chair. It takes mindfulness and training to get your posture right. Formally meditating is a good and\nrecommended practice.\n•\nOwen Richards Soh Wei Yu why would lotus be necessary?\nMichael Zaurov Soh Wei Yu dammmn full lotus? Very nice can you feel energetic shift with it compared\nto say half lotus ?\nSoh Wei Yu Michael Zaurov straighter body and mind body feels more conducive to stilling body and\nmind.\nBut don't worry if you can't sit full lotus..\nBefore this covid thing I frequently sit outside in parks on chairs. Nowadays parks chairs are forbidden for\nuse\n1\nSoh Wei Yu Owen Richards I agree with this explanation by Thrangu Rinpoche:\n1. The Correct Sitting Posture\nGenerally, one might think that one meditates with one’s mind and it doesn’t really matter what position\nthe body is in, that one will still be able to meditate without taking the physical posture into account. But\nthere is a very central factor of meditation involved with the physical posture in making the mind stable. It\nis said that if one is sitting with the body straight, the channels within the body will also be straight. What\nis the benefit if the channels in the body are straight because the body is straight? It means that the air\n277\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nflowing through the channels will then flow straight. Then there will be no blockages and nothing\npreventing the flow of the airs within the channels. What is the benefit if the airs flow straight through the\nchannels? It means that the mind will be in accord if the channels are straight and the airs flow straight.\nThis means that if the mind itself is wavering and unsteady, it is usually based on the wavering\nmovements of the airs flowing through the channels. The nature of the air is related to the mind, so the\nmovement of the mind depends on the movement of the airs. Therefore, if the airs are flowing in a\nstraight way through the channels, then the mind itself will become still and stable; it will not be agitated\nor unstable. This is the reason why the correct posture in sitting is important for meditation. There is\nwhat is called “the seven aspects of Vairocana” for the physical posture in meditation, which doesn’t refer\nto Buddha Vairocana but to the seven aspects of the physical posture that will bring clarity to one’s\nmeditation.\nTwo faults can occur during meditation. The first is mental dullness, in which case the mind is not clear.\nSo, first there is a lack of clarity, then a dullness of mind, then stupor, and finally sleep. When these occur,\none doesn’t have the necessary clarity for the meditation; there is a lack of clarity in the meditation. That\nis one defect one has to be free of. Another defect is agitation of the mind, in which case one may think\nabout things one likes. Feeling happy and glad, one becomes involved with those thoughts and then the\nmind becomes more and more unstable. Sometimes agitation may arise because one regrets something,\nin which case one ponders things one has done, e.g., thinking, “Oh, that was bad. I shouldn’t have done\nthat.” One feels more and more regret, which creates instability in one’s meditation. Or agitation may\narise due to thoughts of doubt, e.g., thinking, “Oh, it should be like this or like that.” One feels more and\nmore doubt, which creates instability of meditation. That is the second fault of meditation, which has to\nbe overcome.\nOne can eliminate the two faults arising in meditation by taking in the seven aspects of sitting that bring\nclarity to meditation. If one is sitting in the correct posture, sometimes one can have dullness or agitation,\nbut one can eliminate these faults more easily by sitting in the correct posture.\nhttp://www.dharmadownload.net/.../Teaching_English_0060.htm\nCalm Abiding Meditation\nSoh Wei Yu\nSakyamuni said to the vast assembly, \"This is why we sit in the full lotus posture.\" Then the Thus Come,\nthe Generous One, teaches his disciples to sit like this. Sometimes those outside of the Way seek for truth\nby standing on the tips of their toes, sometimes they seek the truth by ceaseless standing, sometimes\nthey seek the truth by wrapping their legs around their shoulders. Through silliness like this their minds\nsink into a sea of delusions and the body is never left in peace. For this reason, the Buddha teaches his\nstudents to sit in the full lotus posture with upright minds. Why? If the body is upright, it is easy for the\nmind to be upright. When the body sits up straight, the mind is not weary, the mind is evened, intention is\n278\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\naligned and attention is woven with what is just present. If the mind is agitated or distracted or if the body\nwavers or leans they are restored and balanced. If you want to experience samadhi or enter samadhi, or\neven if the mind is just distracted and following various images, all such states can be completely\nbalanced. Practising in this way, we experience and enter the samadhi that is sovereign of all samadhis.\n- Buddha, quoted by Dogen Zenji in Zanmai-O-Zanmai”\n“(9:57 PM) Thusness: like X he is in the midst of retreating due to some reasons and he is clearly not\naccumulating anything extra. she should retire when the time is right and practice hard. It is not easy to go\nthrough engagement and yet want to realise self-liberation this way. It is all thoughts. this is not self-\nliberation. So before the true realisation of self-liberation, it is best to lessen these activities though we still\ncan be a lay… but lessen these [worldly] activities until correct realisation is attained and continue to refine\nthe experience, then dirty yourself in the mud later.\n(10:01 PM) AEN: as in?\n(10:02 PM) Thusness: means self-liberation aspect is seen, one can dirty himself. :) But not kept dirtying\noneself unknowingly. If she understood by six paramitas in daily life, then that is better and more\napplicable. Like ren ru (patience). Just practice hard. :)” - John Tan, 2007\n\"Relaxing means remaining still, coordinated breathing, holding a fixed gaze, etc., that is the actual meaning\nof “non-doing.” Essentially staying still for prolonged periods of time, like in thögal.\nYet at the same time, that lack of doing takes a great deal of effort, it isn’t easy to sit still for that long.\nThe same goes for resting in a moment of unfabricated consciousness, that clarity takes no effort, but\nremaining undistracted and self-liberating thought takes a great deal of effort.\nOne could say it is a paradox but it isn’t really, the “doing” and “non-doing” are different facets of the same\nundertaking. It is just that sometimes the non-doing is emphasized to contrast causal vehicle practices.\nDzogchen isn’t all non-doing though, there is much to do.\" - Kyle Dixon, 2021,\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dzogchen/comments/o7bodi/you_must_decide_with_complete_certainty_that/\nh310nq7/\n\"Yes, but the true method that develops the view is undistracted self-liberation. It is not so easy, as Sogyal\nRinpoche discusses here:\nIt is extremely hard to rest undistracted in the nature of mind, even for a moment, let alone to self-\nliberate a single thought or emotion as it rises. We often assume that simply because we understand\nsomething intellectually, or think we do, we have actually realized it. This is a great delusion. It requires the\nmaturity that only years of listening, contemplation, reflection, meditation, and sustained practice can\nripen.\" - Kyle Dixon, 2021,\n279\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dzogchen/comments/o7bodi/you_must_decide_with_complete_certainty_that/\nh310nq7/\n“level 2\nkrodha\n· 1d · edited 1d\nAnd to me the logical answer to how one can sustain 24/7 meditation and bliss is by doing the effortless\npractices. Since it was posted in r/dzogchen I gave a dzogchen explanation.\nTo which I replied with the Dzogchen explanation that you cannot jump into effortlessness without\ninitially cultivating the view with effort, and you proceeded to reject that and claimed I am explaining\nthings from the standpoint of causal methods, which I am not, this is mennagde.\nBut that’s honestly where it started and I feel we’re kind of saying the same thing—I agree in the beginning effort\nbased practices are used after recognition.\nI’m not sure that we are saying the same thing. You think practice is effortless, yet for how long can you\nsustain the view before distraction arises? Not long unless you are in retreat, and so sustaining the view\nrequires effort and diligence, and then later when some stability is achieved, it becomes more and more\neffortless. Eventually, awakened equipoise dawns, and then it is actually effortless. There is a gradient of\ndegrees in practice and how it develops, and you seem to want to throw that all out the window and\npretend your practice is effortless when it absolutely isn’t. No one’s practice is effortless who does have a\nhigh degree of stability. There are aspects of practice that are effortless, but someone who claims their\npractice in toto is effortless is deluded.\nBut using effort based practice to try and sustain 24/7 meditation and bliss, as OP was saying, seems harmful.\nIt isn’t harmful. Your practice will not develop otherwise. 24/7 isn’t necessary, but set sessions where the\nview is cultivated are necessary, and the longer the better.\nWe are discussing actual practice here. Actual Dzogchen practice. Not catch phrases about effortlessness\nwe cherry pick from expositions. Trekchö develops through applied effort and it will never, ever, develop\nwithout skillfully applied effort.”\n“I’ve posted a bunch of teachings talking about this effortless dzogchen practice\nYes, but you have no understanding as to how effort is applied within that so-called “effortless” context.\nThe approach is multi-faceted, aspects which require effort coupled with aspects that are effortless, it is\nnot black and white like you are suggesting, all effortless. If it were truly effortless there would be no need\nfor 18 month trekchö retreats, and it wouldn’t take teachers like Kunzang Dechen Lingpa 7 years in strict\nretreat to accomplish the third vision. If it were effortless, these accomplishments would arise\nspontaneously by themselves, but they don’t. They arise for those who employ the view effectively and\nwho understand how diligence and effort are dovetailed with these so-called effortless aspects of the\nview.\n280\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe problem is that if you go around just saying it’s all effortless, you end up closing the door on many\npeople who will follow that advice, form an aversion to effort, and their precious human life will not reach\nits full potential, worst case it will be wasted altogether.\nYou will fall into distraction and this state of being distracted can be left as it is, unaltered\nNo my friend, the minute you detect that you have fallen into discursiveness the view has to be reeled in\nimmediately and that all has to be cut off so that one goes back to exercising self-liberation.\nDiscursiveness is never left as it is, it is a total corruption of one’s practice.\nMaybe you do some other practice and that’s fine.\nI practice the actual view, which involves the attributes I have already covered in previous posts, that is\nthe method as described in the 17 tantras.\nIf you are distracted and allowing distraction to be left unaltered, then you aren’t even practicing\nsūtrayāna, much less dzogpachenpo. Distraction is impossible if you are accurately cultivating the view,\nbecause every arising is directly hit.\nI’ve acknowledged effort based practices are used in the beginning.\nI’m not talking about effort based practices. I am discussing the role of effort in the very same discipline\nyou claim is devoid of effort.” – - Kyle Dixon, 2021,\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dzogchen/comments/o7bodi/you_must_decide_with_complete_certainty_that/\nh310nq7/\n“Many people have a very warped understanding of the so called \"highest teachings\" such as Dzogchen\nand Mahamudra, thinking that these teachings allow us to bypass or skip meditation training, or that it\ndoes not require \"practice\" and \"meditation\".

The problem is that we naturally allow this mental\nfactor to rest on afflictive objects such as HBO, books, video games, etc.\nŚamatha practice is the discipline of harnessing our natural predisposition for concentration, and shifting\nit from afflictive conditioned phenomena to nonafflictive conditioned phenomena, i.e., the phenomena of\n282\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nthe path. We do this in order to create a well tilled field for the growth of vipaśyāna. Śamatha ultimately\nallows us to have mental stability and suppresses afflictive mental factors so that we may eventually give\nrise to authentic insight into the nature of reality. While it is possible to have vipaśyāna without cultivating\nśamatha, it is typically quite unstable and lacks the power to effectively eradicate afflictive patterning from\nour minds. Therefore, the basis of all practice in Buddhadharma, from Abhidharma to the Great Perfection,\nis the cultivation of śamatha as a preliminary practice for germination of vipaśyāna.” -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/09/dzogchen-meditation-and-jhana.html\n“Having simply identified vidyā [rig pa], some people, who lack even a trace of any meditation, claim they\nhave experienced the extinction into dharmatā and there is nothing more to spiritual awakening than this.\nThat is an enormous mistake! The qualities of realization mature through the power of gradual practice.\nThis is how you must reach the state of liberation.\"\n- Dudjom Lingpa\n\"To reject practice by saying, ‘it is conceptual!’ is the path of fools. A tendency of the inexperienced and\nsomething to be avoided.”\n— Longchenpa\n\"People that have gone into the nihilistic understanding of 'non-doing' ended up in a mess. You see that\nthose having right understanding of 'non-doing' are free, yet you see discipline, focus and peace in them.\nLike just sitting and walking... ...in whatever they endeavor. Fully anatta.\" - John Tan, 2018\n“What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality?\nIdentification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive. Not to be able to stop thinking\nis a dreadful affliction, but we don't realize this because almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is\nconsidered normal. This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that\nis inseparable from Being. It also creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of fear and suffering.\nWe will look at all that in more detail later.” - Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now\n“Isn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world?\nYour mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed,\nyou lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people's thinking is not only repetitive\nand useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe\nyour mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy.\nThis kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. What characterizes an addiction? Quite simply this:\nyou no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you. It also gives you a false\nsense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns into pain.” - Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now\n“So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness\n283\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nof the thought. A new dimension of consciousness has come in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a\nconscious presence - your deeper self - behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then\nloses its power over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer energizing the mind through\nidentification with it. This is the beginning of the end of involuntary and compulsive thinking. When a\nthought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in the mental stream - a gap of \"no-mind.\" At first, the\ngaps will be short, a few seconds perhaps, but gradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur,\nyou feel a certain stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your natural state of felt oneness\nwith Being, which is usually obscured by the mind. With practice, the sense of stillness and peace will\ndeepen. In fact, there is no end to its depth. You will also feel a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep\nwithin: the joy of Being.\nIt is not a trancelike state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the\nprice of peace were a lowering of your consciousness, and the price of stillness a lack of vitality and\nalertness, then they would not be worth having. In this state of inner connectedness, you are much more\nalert, more awake than in the mind-identified state. You are fully present. It also raises the vibrational\nfrequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body.\nAs you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in the East, you realize the state\nof pure consciousness. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all\nthinking, all emotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively\ninsignificant in comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond what\nyou previously thought of as \"your self.\" That presence is essentially you and at the same time inconceivably\ngreater than you. What I am trying to convey here may sound paradoxical or even contradictory, but there\nis no other way that I can express it.” - Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now\n(It should be noted that what Eckhart Tolle calls ‘No-Mind’ here is more akin to a state of no conceptual\nthinking + I AM Presence, which is different from how the Awakening to Reality blog uses the term ‘No-Mind’\nas referring to an experience free from any sense of subjectivity of self/Self, which we will discuss later on)\n“I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I didn’t understand it at\nall. It wasn’t until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers,\nthat I realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I understood that the\nintense pressure of suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its\nidentification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This\nwithdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a\nplug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I\nam: consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner\ntimeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in\nstates of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the original experience I just described pales in\ncomparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no\n284\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nrelationships, no job, no home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches\nin a state of the most intense joy.” - Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now\nOn Ramana Maharshi:\n“According to Narasimha, in July 1896,[22][note 5] at age 16, a sudden fear of death befell him. He was struck\nby \"a flash of excitement\" or \"heat\", like some avesam, a \"current\" or \"force\" that seemed to possess him,[web\n1] while his body became rigid. He initiated a process of self-enquiry asking himself what it is that dies. He\nconcluded that the body dies, but that this \"current\" or \"force\" remains alive, and recognised this \"current\"\nor \"force\" as his Self, which he later identified with \"the personal God, or Iswara\".[web 1][note 2]\nIn one of his rare written comments on this process Ramana Maharshi wrote, \"Enquiring within Who is the\nseer? I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say I saw. How\nthen could the thought arise to say I did not see.\"[web 5]\nLater in life, he called his death experience akrama mukti, \"sudden liberation\", as opposed to the krama\nmukti, \"gradual liberation\" as in the Vedanta path of jnana yoga.[web 3][note 6] It resulted in a state of mind\nwhich he later described as \"the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani:\"[web 1]\nAfter reading the language of the sacred books, I see it may be termed suddha manas [pure mind],\nakhandakara vritti [unbroken experience], prajna [true knowledge] etc.; that is, the state of mind of Iswara\nor the jnani.\"[web 1]\nAfter this event, he lost interest in school studies, friends, and relations. He was absent-minded at school,\n\"imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me\".[web 3] Avoiding company,\nhe preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force,[29] and went daily to the\nMeenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to the images of the 63 Nayanars and of Nataraja, wanting \"the\nsame grace as was shown to those saints\",[web 3] praying that he \"should have the same bhakti that they\nhad\"[web 3] and \"[weeping] that God should give me the same grace He gave to those saints\".[web 3][11][note 7]\nKnowing his family would not permit him to become a sanyassin and leave home, Venkataraman slipped\naway, telling his brother he needed to attend a special class at school.[31] Venkataraman boarded a train on\n1 September 1896 and traveled to Tiruvannamalai where he remained for the rest of his life.[citation needed]\nTiruvannamalai temples (1896–1899)\nArunachaleswara Temple, Tiruvannamalai\nArunachaleswara temple (1896–1897)\n285\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nOn arriving in Tiruvannamalai, Maharshi went to the temple of Arunachaleswara.[32] The first few weeks he\nspent in the thousand-pillared hall, then shifted to other spots in the temple, and eventually to the Patala-\nlingam vault so that he might remain undisturbed. There, he spent days absorbed in such deep samādhi\nthat he was unaware of the bites of vermin and pests. Seshadri Swamigal, a local saint, discovered him in\nthe underground vault and tried to protect him.[31] After about six weeks in the Patala-lingam, he was\ncarried out and cleaned up. For the next two months he stayed in the Subramanya Shrine, so unaware of\nhis body and surroundings that food had to be placed in his mouth or he would have starved.\nGurumurtam temple (1897–1898)\nIn February 1897, six months after his arrival at Tiruvannamalai, Ramana moved to Gurumurtam, a temple\nabout a mile away.[33] Shortly after his arrival a sadhu named Palaniswami went to see him.[34] Palaniswami's\nfirst darshan left him filled with peace and bliss, and from that time on he served Ramana as his permanent\nattendant. Besides physical protection, Palaniswami would also beg for alms, cook and prepare meals for\nhimself and Ramana, and care for him as needed.[35] In May 1898 Ramana moved to a mango orchard next\nto Gurumurtam.[36]\nOsborne wrote that during this time Ramana completely neglected his body.[35] He also ignored the ants\nwhich bit him incessantly.[33] Gradually, despite Ramana's desire for privacy, he attracted attention from\nvisitors who admired his silence and austerities, bringing offerings and singing praises. Eventually a\nbamboo fence was built to protect him.[33]\nWhile living at the Gurumurtam temple his family discovered his whereabouts. First, his uncle Nelliappa\nIyer came and pleaded with him to return home, promising that the family would not disturb his ascetic\nlife. Ramana sat motionless and eventually his uncle gave up.[37]\nIn September 1898 Ramana moved to the Shiva-temple at Pavalakkunru, one of the eastern spurs of\nArunachala. He refused to return even though his mother begged him to.[38]” - Wikipedia on Ramana\nMaharshi,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi#Adolescence_and_awakening_(1895%E2%80%931896)\nIn the early years of John Tan’s journey right after his I AM realization at the age of 17, he was very engrossed\nwith entering Nirvikalpa Samadhi and wanted to renounce to focus all his time abiding in Nirvikalpa\nSamadhi or absorption in Self/Pure Presence while shutting out all distractions of the external senses,\nhowever he faced resistance from family objections. The Pure Presence at this phase was only experienced\nas the Mind door and not extended to all the other senses (more on this in Stage 4 and 5), so according to\nJohn Tan the tendency was to turn away or withdraw from the five senses (plus conceptual thoughts and\nimpressions) to abide as the [formless] Self/Source [as pure consciousness].\n“\"When I was young, after the experience of I AM presence and read the book by Ramana Maharshi, I was\nso inspired and felt like giving up everything and follow the footsteps of Ramana to go reside in Mt\nArunachala. ” - John Tan, 2018\n286\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nOn an interesting note, Ramana Maharshi has gone through two separate awakenings - first on the I AM\nand second one was about One Mind. After his first awakening, he spent much of his time in deep\nmeditative absorptions/samadhi in caves, but after his second awakening he was integrated into his daily\nlife and functionings, and no longer placed as much emphasis on entering special states of trance or\nnirvikalpa samadhi as previously, although he still entered into meditative samadhi.

I am planning for my retirement.\nI think after stabilizing non-dual experience and maturing the insight of anatta, practice must turn\ntowards ‘self-releasing’ and ‘dispassion’ rather than intensifying ‘non-dual’ luminosity. Although being\nbare in attention or naked in awareness will help in dissolving the sense of ‘I’ and division, we must also\nlook into dissolving the sense of ‘mine’. In my opinion, dissolving of the sense of ‘I’ does not equate to\ndissolving the sense of ‘mine’ and attachment to possessions can still be strong even after very stable\nnon-dual experience. This is because the former realization only mange to eliminate the dualistic\ntendency while the latter requires us to embody and actualize the right view of ‘emptiness’. Very seldom\ndo we realize it has a lot to do with our ‘view’ that we hold in our deep most consciousness. We must\nallow our luminous essence to meet differing conditions to realise the latent deep.

The problem is with the word 'consciousness'. I prefer to use Awareness Without\n293\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nContent in place of Consciousness Without Content to emphasise the complete difference from sense\nconsciousness. For most people, I think it's difficult to know Awareness Without Content (cessation)\nclearly when sense consciousness remains, and very often it's confused with the mind merely going very\nquiet. Cessation leads to deeper understanding than any of the stages listed in the A2R system. as in all of\nthem there does remain a subtle arisingness generated by remnants of what we call 'self'. Cessation\nimplies nothing arising at all, no activation of Dependent Origination. With total cessation the nature of\nthat subtle generation of self/consciousness/ mind/ world becomes clear. Cessation can happen while\nsense consciousness is operating, and that reveals clearly the nature of generation of what we call 'me'.\nBut if it happens while conscious, I think it is easy to miss the deeper aspect of the Buddha's teaching on\nDependent Origination. Therefore there is enormous benefit if cessation/ Awareness Without Content\nhappens during deep sleep. I doubt it is possible to fully understand the Buddha's teaching on Dependent\norigination without cessation during deep sleep.\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nDavid Brown\nWhat you are describing is just nirvikalpa samadhi in the I AM. It is not particularly special and is not\nunknown to us in AtR. John Tan, I and many others have experienced tremendously blissful samadhi\nabsorption in Self. As I wrote recently, John Tan sat for hours each time in nirvikalpa samadhi with his\nCh'an master in Thailand during his I AM stage. He could sit all day and actually almost became a monk\nand renunciant like Ramana Maharshi to focus entirely his time in absorption in the Self without the\ndistractions of other sensory phenomena back when he was 17 but was stopped by his family.\nRamana Maharshi said,\n\"Abiding permanently in any of these samadhis, either Savikalpa or Nirvikalpa, is Sahaja. What is body-\nconsciousness? It is the insentient body plus consciousness. Both these must lie in another consciousness\nwhich is absolute and unaffected, and ever-abiding, with or without the body-consciousness. What does it\nthe matter whether the body-consciousness is lost or retained, provided one is holding on to that Pure\nConsciousness? Total absence of body-consciousness has the advantage of making the Samadhi more\nintense, although it makes no difference in the knowledge of the Supreme. (Ramana Maharshi, GR, 88.) \"\nHere he is saying the type of nirvikalpa samadhi where all senses are shut and one is merely absorbed in\nSelf simply makes the samadhi or absorption in Self more intense, but it makes no difference to Self-\nKnowledge.\nI will paste more excerpts in the following posts.\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\n294\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nAnd yes I have experienced total cessation [of sensory and mental phenomena] and pure formless\nnondual clear light in deep sleep. It can also be intensely blissful, just the bliss of pure presence. I actually\nwrote some of those experiences in the sleep chapter towards the end of the AtR Guide.\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nSim Pern Chong (who was at the I AM phase when he first encountered John Tan back in 2004 and was\nthe first to break through to anatta and emptiness back in 2006 to 2008) wrote more than ten years ago:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../a-compilation-of...\nrealization: Oh yes Simpo, can I just ask how you realised the I AM years ago?\nSimpo: There are actually 2 significant events:\n1. In the 1980s when i was a teenager, i sat down to meditate for the first time. I experienced great bliss.\nIn this meditation, i experienced 'no ultimate right or wrong' aka non-judgemental and is soaked in a vast\nocean of bliss for a few days. Haha... i thought i was enlightened. On hindsight now, i know that i was not.\nThat is why now when people write about non-dual to meant 'no right/wrong' I know which stage they are\nat.\n2. In the 1990s, i join a meditation class that held sessions every Sunday at a Buddhist temple. I was\nlearning one-point meditation. One afternoon when i was meditating at home, all the sensory\nimpressions stopped including thoughts. I was in a state of 'No-thoughts'. One may think that when there\nare no thoughts, one must be unconscious. No there is no unconsciousness. Instead what was being\nexperienced was pure Presence/awareness. However due to not understanding the nature of\nconsciousness and reality, this awareness was experienced as an Eternal Witness/Observer. This is the\npure experience of I AM presence.\n...\nIn my case, the initial experience happened during a meditation which led me to the misassumption of 'I\nAM'. The experience is pure, but the latter interpretation of it was wrong.\nIn 'No-I' experience, one simply realised that there is no self in any experience even when consciousness\nis rolling own. There can be thinking, but there is no thinker.\nOn the other hand, in complete consciousness blank-out, yet awareness persists, there is not a single\nthought or any form of mental formation. Basically, there is no thinking, no mental image or any form of\nconsciousness that we normally have. It will be distinctive because it is this experience that will allow one\nto see for the first time the difference between mental-mixed consciousness and pure presence.\nComplete mental formation shut down and yet awareness still exist, it is not the same as sleep.\nPersonally, I don't see a point in maintaining witnessing even into sleep. It is really a desire to have that\nexpereince of Presence.\n...\nI think Eckhart Tolle may have been suffering alot and suddenly he 'let go' of trying to work out his\nproblems. This results in a dissociation from thoughts which give rise to the experience of Presence.\n295\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nTo me, 'I AM' is an experience of Presence, it is just that only one aspect of Presence is experienced which\nis the 'all-pervading' aspect. The non-dual and emptiness aspect are not experienced.. Because non-dual\nis not realised (at I AM stage), a person may still use effort in an attempt to 'enter' the Presence. This is\nbecause, at the I AM stage, there is an erroneous concept that there is a relative world make up of\nthoughts AND there is an 'absolute source' that is watching it. The I AM stage person will make attempts\nto 'dissociated from the relative world' in order to enter the 'absolute source'.\nHowever, at Non-dual (& further..) stage understanding, one have understood that the division into a\nrelative world and an absolute source has NEVER occcured and cannot be... Thus no attempt/effort is\ntruly required.\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nEdmond Cigale, who realised anatta after I conversed with him back in DhO and those conversations\nsomehow triggered his further investigation and breakthrough into nondual and anatta back in 2011,\nwrote this: [link redacted]\nWhere he compared the different types of samadhi he has gone through. Please don't share this file\noutside as it is going to be published into a book but here is an excerpt.\nBack in his I AM phase he was able to enter kevala nirvikalpa samadhi at will,\n\" this context, Sri Ramana Maharshi used to say: \"That which is not present in deep dreamless sleep is not\nreal.”(quoted in Wilber 1998). Well, I have faced such notions withslight apprehension. How can emotions\nand thoughts (mine or those of others) be unreal, if they obviously exist? Yes, they are not absolutely real,\nas far as the Causal Self is concerned, but they exist nonetheless. I tried to compensate the inner\ndisharmonyby focusing on impersonal aspect of the “I am” presence, trying to realize and hold on to “That\nwhich is only Real\" during my wake consciousness. I have failed to achieve that.This tendency,\nhowever,eventually yieldedfree flow and easy entry into the Causalstate samādhi at will, but that was all.\nThere was no way (for me) to handle the relative sensory input with mere Awareness of the naked Truth\nby entering samādhi at will.There was always this duality present: Me or the Absolute Reality on one\nhand, and the world drama of sensory input, on the other; almost unperceivable subtle tension and clear\ndisharmony were always present.Obviously, my Causal realization was not perfected yet (and the nondual\nwas not known, yet).\"\nAPP.BOX.COM\nBox\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nFrom Edmond's text:\n296\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nThis state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi is also described even by Theravada monks like Ajahn Brahmavamso:\n“When the Body Disappears. [text snipped, posted in AtR guide elsewhere]\n297\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nPitfalls and Dangers of the I AM Phase\n“If at the \"I AM\" phase you were to practice wrongly, I think you will be stuck probably until old age with\nlittle break-through.” - John Tan, 2011\nOne of the most common pitfalls is thinking that the I AM is the final, ultimate Truth. Most people who\nrealized I AM think that way and just stagnate there. As I mentioned before, as an estimate based on my\n(Soh)’s decade+ years of encountering, reading and conversing with many realized practitioners and\nteachers, roughly 90% of any given realized person is simply having the realization of I AMness, 8% are\nabout One Mind, and only 2% or less are having anatta realization and further.\n“Though buddha nature is plainness and most direct, these are still the steps. If one does not know the\nprocess and said ‘yes this is it’… then it is extremely misleading. For 99 percent [of ‘realized’/’enlightened’\npersons] what one is talking about is \"I AMness\", and has not gone beyond permanence, still thinking [of]\npermanence, formless… ...all and almost all will think of it along the line of \"I AMness\", all are like the\ngrandchildren of \"AMness\", and that is the root cause of duality.” - John Tan, 2007\nAs Adyashanti pointed out,\n\"Emptiness (Soh: Adyashanti’s Emptiness means ‘I AMness’ here of John Tan’s Stage 1, not the Buddhistic\nEmptiness/Sunyata of John Tan’s Stage 6 discussed in this guide) is not the totality of what you are.\nEmptiness is a profound aspect of what you are, it's a profound taste of your true nature, it's not the\ntotality of what you are any than getting up in the morning and feeling good is the totality of what you\nare, or feeling bad is a totality of what you are... ...Whenever you touch upon a deep truth, suchness of\nreality, your true nature, each aspect feels like it's total and complete and all-inclusive at that moment. So\nthat's why teachers have a very hard time getting through to people when they have an initial experience\nof anything because if it's an initial experience of reality it feels totally complete and there is a certain\ninnate confidence that arises within you. Not an egoic confidence but a confidence that comes from\nreality.\"\nOther pitfalls in the I AM phase include:\n~ Reifying Host and Guest (An Unchanging Awareness)\nThere is a tendency at the I AM phase to reify the space of awareness as the unchanging background,\nAbsolute host, and container, of all the passing contents of thoughts, perceptions, feelings and sensations.\nInstead of focusing on reifying and solidifying this image of a changeless and inherently existing Host, we\nshould instead focus on the four aspects of I AM as described above. Otherwise we will get stuck in the I\nAM phase.\n298\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nDuring my I AM phase, I saw Awareness as an unchanging host, like an infinite empty space where the\n‘guests’ of all transient phenomena come and go leaving the formless host of awareness untouched. John\nTan subsequently had a conversation with me, from Soh’s Journal and Notes on Spiritual Awakening:\nSoh wrote: “14 May 2010\nWalking/Jogging/Running meditation\nWhile jogging just now, I 'forgot' my mind and body. It feels like I'm the still presence in which the world\nmoves through. Instead of being a body running on the road from here to there, it's seen that I am the\nspace that encompasses the whole world and the whole world moves through me. I am not moving. The\nworld is moving through me.\nIt feels like you're running on the treadmill, you're not actually moving! Except that the scenery moves\nthrough you.\nYou can practice seeing this next time when you walk or jog. This space of awareness is unmoving, whether\nor not the world is moving.\nLater I was reminded of this video http://www.headless.org/videos/still_point.htm\n15 May 2010\nFrom: http://www.taozen.se/host.htm\nHost and Guest\nIn the Surangama Sutra Arya Ajnatakaundinya puts the question: \"What is the difference between the\npermanent and the changing?\nHe answers by giving an example of a traveler who stops at an Inn. The traveler eats, sleeps and then\ncontinues on his journey. He doesn't stay to settle in the Inn, but pays his bill and leaves.\nBut what with the Innkeeper? He doesn't leave. He keeps on staying at the Inn to receive and take leave of\nguests, because that is where he lives.\n\"Therefore, I declare that the changing is guest and the permanent is host\", says Arya Ajnatakaundinya.\n299\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIn that way we identify all thoughts that comes and goes as changing, travelers that arrives and leaves and\nthat doesn't need any further investigation.\nOur Buddha-self is the host who lets the traveler - the thought - leave without hindrance. A good host\ndoesn't keep up the traveler at his departure.\nAnother way to illustrate this is by imaging an empty space with a sun ray shining in. In this ray you'll see a\nlot of dust in the empty room. The dust is moving but the space is empty. That that is still and clear is called\nspace, that that is moving is called dust, because that is the being of dust.\nGuest and dust refers to illusory thought, while the host and space refers to the Buddha-nature.\nThis shows that the permanent Buddha-nature doesn't follow the illusory thoughts in their coming and\ngoing, rising and falling. So if one is unaffected by things, there won't be any hindrances even if one is\nsurrounded by the ten thousand things.\nIllusory thoughts comes and goes by themselves and don't hinder the True Nature of Suchness.\n15 May 2010\nThose who wish to practice self-inquiry should read Methods of Practice in the Chan Hall and the Essentials\nof Chan Practice by Ch'an Master Hsu Yun\n15 May 2010\nJust had a discussion with John. I think there is something very important to caution readers here based on\nwhat he told me.\nThe experience of the Witness is important, and is undeniable. The Certainty of Being is a natural certainty\nthat cannot be negated. This is not wrong. You cannot deny your own existence (how could you? if you try\nto deny it, who is it denying it?)\nThere is nothing wrong with experiencing directly without intermediary the pure sense of existence. But\nafter this direct experience, one should refine the understanding, our views, our insights. Instead of\ndeviating from the right view, reinforcing the wrong view, after the experience.\nJohn also told me that what I have experienced has nothing to do with 'beingness being unchanging,\nconstant and permanent'. Yet I was re-enforcing this wrong view into my consciousness like chanting. He\n300\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ntold me not to do that, and that what I described is not my direct experience, but instead it is my mind\nplaying tricks. What is experienced is just luminosity, non-conceptuality, directness, nothing more than that.\nSo instead of describing what I experienced, I was reminding myself what is not true. We actually never\nexperience anything unchanging.\nHe also said that though I am experiencing the \"host and guest\", he told me not to focus on 'permanent,\nunchanging, and independent' aspect as by doing so with a few more months of intense training, I will\nbecome stuck for decades in the formless realms and it will be difficult to get out. Instead, I should be\nfocusing on the impersonality aspect, and the four aspects of I AM he talked to me about, then afterwards\nexperience non dual and anatta.\nIt is not about denying the Witness, but refining our insight of it:\n- what is meant by non-dual?\n- what is meant by non-conceptual?\n- what is meant by being spontaneous?\n- what is the 'impersonality' aspect?\n- what is luminosity?\np.s. just had a conversation with John to clarify on the 'unmoving' nature of Awareness in Shurangama\nSutra.\nI think it is pretty clear in explaining how the 'unmoving' nature of awareness is not the Hindu\nunderstanding of 'permanence of Self, impermanence of objects'.\n….\nJohn: The Hinayanist is not what that is wrong. Some of the sutra like to belittle Hinayanist. :P\n(Note by Soh: It is known nowadays that Shurangama Sutra, the scripture from which the notion of Host and\nGuest comes from, is a Chinese invention - it talks about Taoist ‘xiens’ (immortals) and is evidently a Chinese\ncomposition not of Indian origins, with no counterparts in the Tibetan canon, a topic discussed in My opinion on\nShurangama Sutra\nMahayana Sutras and Vajrayana Tantras are composed later by unknown authors showing development over\ntime, in contrast to Pali suttas which stays closest to the Buddha’s original words, a topic discussed in Yogacara\nvs Madhyamaka, Authorship of Mahayana Sutras - which is not to say that they are any less valuable as it should\nbe noted that Mahayana sutras are generally very profound especially on its elaborations on the emptiness and\nnon-arising of phenomena.)\n301\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWhat Buddha [Soh: i.e. Shurangama Sutra] is trying to teach is about non-movement, but the illustration is\nnot a good one in my opinion. In non-dual insight, nothing moves. When your mind follows phenomena\nand dwell in dualistic concept, phenomena appears moving. But when insight arises, nothing moves. Now\nfor there to be moving, what must happen? If you cannot measure, cannot grasp, cannot find its locality,\nfrom where is it moving? If awareness hasn’t moved then how does knowing arise? How is there awareness?\nIF awareness cannot be said to be moving, then how can we say thoughts are moving? If one taste of both\nnature and essence are directly experienced, then there is true insight. If you cling to thoughts or discard\nthoughts, that is also moving. If you see the luminous and empty nature, nothing moves. Get it?\nAn Eternal Now: I think so\nJohn: If you say you saw something...that is awareness. Do you consider that to be moving or not moving?\nYou see the words flow…\nAn Eternal Now: The pure experience is not moving, if we measure it then we see movement\nJohn: If you are looking from the perspective of object, everything is moving. If you are looking from the\nperspective of awareness, nothing seems to move. If you realize luminous essence and empty nature, then\nnothing also moves. The former is One-Mind, the latter is no-mind. But no-mind can have varying degrees\nof insight and experience. Though people might say it is conceptual to say or categorize further, but it is a\nskilful means.” - A journal entry in Soh’s E-Book\nIn the I AM phase the spacious all-pervading aspect of Presence is reified into a static background, while in\nthe further phase of anatta, the space-like, boundless field of consciousness/universe is experienced and\nrealized to be the foreground without being abstracted and reified into a background.\n“Hi AEN,\nYes not to be fixated but also not to objectify the “spaciousness” otherwise “spaciousness” is no less fixated.\nThe ‘space’ appears appealing only to a mind that abstracts but to a fully participating and involving mind,\nsuch “spaciousness” has immediately sets itself apart, distancing itself from inseparable. Emptiness is\nnever a behind background but a fully partaking foreground manifesting as the arising and passing\nphenomena absence of a center. Therefore understand ‘spaciousness’ not like sky but like passing clouds\nand flowing water, manifesting whenever condition is. If ‘Emptiness’ has made us more fixated and\nimmobilized this innate freedom of our non-dual luminosity, then it is ‘stubborn emptiness’.\nNevertheless, no matter what said, it is always inadequate. If we want to fully realize the inexpressible, be\nwilling to give up all centers and point of references that manifests in the form of ‘who’, ‘when’ and ‘where’.\nJust give up the entire sense of self then instantly all things are spontaneously perfected.\n302\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nJust a sharing, nothing intense.\nHappy New Year! :)\n…\nThere is no lack of clarity in whatever that is manifesting, simply forgo the self and be fully participating.” -\nJohn Tan, 2009\n“Therefore the so called \"Clear Aware Space\" is no more special than this moment of arising sound or\npassing scent. The failure to recognize that all apparent arising and passing transience is non other than\nthe Dharmakaya is the problem of all problems.\nWhen a pith instruction like “Relax and fully open to whatever is” is taught to a mind that is still under\nstrong influence of dualistic tendencies, it is easy for such a mind to read and practice in the form of\nclinging to the “Aware Space” and shunting away from the transience, thereby setting itself infinitely apart\nunknowingly.\nIf however there is maturity of insight that whatever arises share the same taste -- luminous yet empty\n(via twofold emptiness), then practice is naturally and simply unreserved opening to whatever is, it cannot\nbe otherwise. There can be no movement, duality and preference from this to that for there is no ‘this’\nthat is more ‘this’ than that.\nWith clear recognition and unperturbed practice of complete unreserved opening to whatever is, all\ntransience will reveal to posses the same taste of non-dual samadhi and self-liberation that we once\nthought to be the monopoly of the so called “Clear Aware Space”.\nIt is therefore advisable that after the direct experience and realization of the pure sense of existence, a\npractitioner further penetrates anatta and the empty nature of phenomena. These insights are necessary\nand should not be considered “long cut”. It will help a practitioner better appreciate the art of great ease\nin time to come.\nMy 2 cents.\nThe degree of “un-contrivance”,\nIs the degree of how unreserved and fearless we open to whatever is.\nFor whatever arises is mind, always seen, heard, tasted and experienced.\nWhat that is not seen, not heard and not experienced,\nIs our conceptual idea of what mind is.\n303\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nWhenever we objectify the “brilliance, the pristine-ness” into an entity that is formless,\nIt becomes an object of grasp that prevents the seeing of the “forms”,\nthe texture and the fabric of awareness.\nThe tendency to objectify is subtle,\nwe let go of 'selfness' yet unknowingly grasped ‘nowness’ and ‘hereness’.\nWhatever arises merely dependently originates, needless of who, where and when.\nAll experiences are equal, luminous yet empty of self-nature.\nThough empty it has not in anyway denied its vivid luminosity.\nLiberation is experiencing mind as it is.\nSelf-Liberation is the thorough insight that this liberation is always and already is;\nSpontaneously present, naturally perfected!” – John Tan to Mr. J, 2012\n“He has realized I AM, not just an experience. Impersonality is also clear and there are intermitent non-\ndual experiences but has mistaken the death of the ego as anatta. Focus on forgetting the ‘beingness’ and\nleave no trace of ‘beingness’ until the background is completely gone, always only the phenomenon in its\nprimordial purity.” – John Tan on Mr. P, 2011\n“Be it Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana; be it Dzogchen, Mahamudra or Zen; they do not deviate from\nthe definitive view of the 3 universal characteristics of dharma. Therefore experiences and realizations\nmust always be authenticated with right view, otherwise we end in wonderland that is neither here nor\nthere.\nThe \"who am I\" of advaita and \"before birth who am I\" may have the same initial \"realization\" -- the face\nto face direct authentication of one's original face, and followed by a series of similar mind-shaking\nexperiences but when subject to madhyamaka ultimate analysis, they fall short of the prajna that\nbuddhism is talking about. Therefore keep the realization but refine the view.” – John Tan, 2020, to\nsomeone at the I AM phase\n“Many Zen and Ch'an masters do point to a similar realization as Hinduism's Atman, however as some of\nthem clarified, such as Phillip Kapleau Roshi, it is simply an initial realization and the realization is to be\nrefined later on. Hinduism's Atman is the direct authentication of the aspect of the luminous clarity and\nPresence of our Buddha-nature, but its empty nature ('no mind' as taught by Bodhidharma) is realised\nlater on. Prior to that refinement of insight, Buddha-nature can be somewhat reified into Atman-\nBrahman.\nFor example, Phillip Kapleau Roshi mentioned in his book \"Straight to the Heart of Zen: Eleven Classic\nKoans & Their Inner Meanings\", the two distinct phases of realization in Zen practice that corresponds to\nwhat I personally term \"I AM realization\" and \"anatta~total exertion\":\n304\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n\"...A shallow kensho is not fully satisfying. One has seen into constant change, it is true, and into the\nformless Self as well - that which makes change possible. One has caught a glimpse of both change and\nchangelessness. But it's only a glimpse, and it is not enough, because in reality, the two worlds of change\nand changelessness are not really two at all. After a time this initial seeing makes us want to go further,\ndeeper. Instinctively we know that it's only well-chewed food that nourishes and satisfies. This we might\ntake as meaning long training through which we more fully integrate our understanding into our daily\nlives. Our enlightenment is fully digested. Now change is Changelessness. This is what keeps away hunger\nand uncertainty, anxiety, fear, and above all unsatisfactoriness, the constant feeling of being on edge,\nalienated, separated - 'a stranger and afraid', as the poet A. E. Housman wrote, 'in a world I never made.'\nAt last we know real peace.\nThe verse says: 'This one instant, as it is, is an infinite number of kalpas.' What is a kalpa? The sutras\ndescribe a kalpa as the length of time it would take a heavenly being, adeva, sweeping its gossamer wings\nacross the top of the mile-high mountain once each year to wear that mountain down to the ground. This\none instant is a kalpa. All time is in this instant, and an infinite number of kalpas are, at the time, this one\ninstant. All time means past, present, and future....\n...if our mind is entirely free from both time and timelessness, it we are living fully and wholly every\nmoment, every moment is everything; all of time is in each full, vitally alive moment. If one has truly seen\ninto time and timelessness - if one has really become time itself - then there is no notion of time or\ntimelessness to hinder or bind...\"” – Soh, 2020, Is Mind Unchanging\n“Actually the I AM is a very important, in fact crucial realization even in various traditions of Buddhism. It\nshould not just be relegated as \"merely a non-Buddhist insight that Buddhists should skip\". I provided\nplenty of quotes in AtR guide to demonstrate this point.\nAtR guide simply puts it in its proper place and explains how to navigate those territories without getting\nstuck in wrong views.” – Soh, 2020\n“AEN posted a great site about what I am trying to convey. Do go through the videos. I will divide what\nthat are being discussed in the videos into the method, the view and the experience for ease of\nillustration as follows:\n1. The method is what that is commonly known as self enquiry.\n2. The view currently we have is dualistic. We see things in terms of subject/object division.\n3. The experience can be further divided into the followings:\n3.1 A strong individual sense of identity\n3.2 An oceanic experience free from conceptualization.\nThis is due to the practitioner freeing himself from conceptuality, from labels and symbols. The mind\ncontinuous disassociates itself from all labeling and symbols.\n3.3 An oceanic experience dissolving into everything.\n305\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThe period of non-conceptuality is prolonged. Long enough to dissolve the mind/body ‘symbolic’ bond\nand therefore inner and outer division is temporarily suspended.\nThe experience for 3.2 and 3.3 are transcendental and are precious. However these experiences are\ncommonly misinterpreted and distorted by objectifying these experiences into an entity that is “ultimate,\nchangeless and independent”. The objectified experience is known as Atman, God or Buddha Nature by\nthe speaker in the videos. It is known as the experience of “I AM” with differing degree of intensity of non-\nconceptuality. Usually practitioners that have experienced 3.2 and 3.3 find it difficult to accept the\ndoctrine of Anatta and Emptiness. The experiences are too clear, real and blissful to discard. They are\noverwhelmed.\nBefore we go further, why do you think these experiences are distorted?\n(hint: The view currently we have is dualistic. We see things in terms of subject/object division.)” – John\nTan, 2008\n““Without using any languages, ‘I’, ‘me’ or any signs or symbols, how is ‘I’ experienced?”\nOf all teachings, no teaching is more important than a direct ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all\ndangers, none is more dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.\nThe ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly understood due to our karmic tendencies.\nUse the doctrine of Anatta and Emptiness as antidote after the 'touch'.” – John Tan, 2008\n~ Reifying a Universal Consciousness\nThis reification comes when the impersonality aspect of the Four Aspects of I AM is experienced.\n“The Tendency to Extrapolate a Universal Consciousness\n24th May 2010 entry of my e-book:\nOriginally posted by An Eternal Now:\nYour mirror-like awareness has no limitations, has no boundaries and edges. It does not belong to any\nobject that appears on it. It does not belong to the body-mind object that you identify as 'yourself'. It does\nnot belong to anything. But everything arise from that…\n…Impersonal/Universal Awareness is animating or ‘powering’ the body and the personality like electricity is\npowering the TV to show the images on screen. Whatever happens on screen is ‘run’ only by the ‘power’ of\nthe One Mind.\nEverything and everyone is the spontaneous functioning of One Mind, there is no individual\ndoers/actors/selves.\nJust had a conversation with John about this.\n306\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nHe told me that there is a problem of saying more than what is necessary, and that it comes from a clinging\nmind. That is, stripping of 'individuality' and 'personality' becoming a 'Universal Mind' is an extrapolation, a\ndeduction. It is not direct experience like \"in thinking just thoughts\", \"in perceptions just perceptions\", \"in\nseeing just the seen\" - just 'what is'.\nSimilarly when I experienced 'impersonality', it is just 'impersonality', but it becomes a 'Universal Mind' due\nto clinging which prevents seeing. And if I further reinforce this idea, it becomes a made belief and appears\ntrue and real.\nTherefore when I said 'impersonality', I am not being blinded as I am merely describing what I have\nexperienced. This Mind is still an individual mindstream, and though impersonality leads one to have the\nsort of 'Universal Mind' kind of sensation, one must correctly understand it.\nBuddhism never denies this mind stream, it simply denies the self-view. It denies separation, it denies an\nobserver, a thinker. It denies a perfect controller, an independent agent. This is what 'Self' means, otherwise\nwhy is it a 'Self'? An individual mindstream remains as an individual mindstream, but it is nothing related\nto a Self.\nHence it is important to understand liberation from the right understanding, otherwise one gets confused.\nThere is the experience of non-duality, Anatta, 'Tada'\n(https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2010/04/tada.html), Stainlessness\n(https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2010/04/stainlessness.html), but these have nothing to do with Self.\nHence if one wants to understand Presence, then one must clearly and correctly understand Presence.\nIt is important to refine the understanding of Presence through the four aspects: impersonality, degree of\nluminosity, dissolving the need to reconfirm and understanding why it is unnecessary, and effortlessness.\nThese have no extrapolation and are what I am experiencing currently, and these requires improvement\nso that one can progress from \"I AM\".\nThere is the experience of impersonality. It is the stripping off of the personality aspect, and it causes one\nto link to a higher force, as if a cosmic life is functioning within me, like what Casino_King (a forummer who\nposted many years ago in both the Christian and Buddhist forums) experienced and described - the\nimpersonal life force, which he called Holy Spirit.\nIt is as if it is all the functioning of a higher power, that life is itself taking the functioning, so dissolving\n'personality' somehow allows me to get 'connected'.\n307\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nI agreed with John and told him that just yesterday I remembered a Christian quote that is very apt in\ndescribing this aspect: \"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life\nI live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\"- Galatians 2:20\nJohn agrees and told me that it is about surrendering to this greater power, that it is not you, but the life in\nyou that is doing the work. It is the key of getting 'connected' to a higher power, to a divine life, to a sacred\npower - and one wants to lose oneself for this divinity to work through us. And this is what John meant by\nJohn Tan/Thusness Stage 3 experience, the 'I' is the block, because of 'holding' one is unable to 'surrender'\ncompletely. When one completely surrenders, the divine will will become your 'will'.\nThis is not the non-dual sort of experience, nor is it about I AM or the Certainty of Being, nor is it about\nAnatta.\nFor example, \"I AM\" allows you to directly experience 'your' very own existence, the beingness, the\ninnermost essence of 'You'.\nA true and genuine practitioner must give rise to all these insights, and understand the causes and\nconditions that give rise to the experiences and not get mixed up. Many people get mixed up over different\n'types' of 'no self'.\nFor example, no-self of non-dual, no-self of anatta, non-inherent existence and impersonality, are all not\nreferring to the same experience - but rather they are different results of dissolving certain aspect of the\ntendencies.\nHence a practitioner must be sincere in his practice to clearly see, and not pretend that one knows.\nOtherwise practice is simply more mix-up, confusion, and nonsense. It is not that it cannot be known, it is\njust that the mind isn't clear enough to see the causes and conditions of arising.” - Soh\nkrodha (Kyle Dixon)\n· 13h\nFrom page 118 of the book ‘Inborn Realization’ by Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal “There is not and will never be a\nsingle mind that is shared by everyone—there will always be limitless individual minds. Everyone, whether\nenlightened or not, has his or her own mind. Each individual mind can and does reflect everything and\neverybody. For these reasons, the teachings say that everyone is the sovereign ruler of his or her universe.”\nVery nice.\nThis seems to bother some people, but if they understood that removing the two obscurations unbinds\nthe mind and exhausts the bifurcation into an inner subjective experience versus an outer external world,\nand everything is then experienced as one’s own immaculate self-display, then perhaps they would not\nobject to multiple conventional mindstreams.\n308\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nIt seems this issue always boils down to people struggling with how convention is understood and\napplied.\n- No Universal Mind\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nLuminosity is not an intrinsic characteristic of things because there are no inherent or intrinsic\ncharacteristics or natures. Wetness is not the intrinsic nature of water, heat is not the intrinsic nature of\nfire. They are just names for the same thing. Therefore luminosity cannot be abstracted to be the nature\nor intrinsic characteristic of appearance, it's just describing appearance are luminous. That's all.\nAs I explained recently,\n\"Soh Wei YuAdmin\nA key takeaway from the above:\nWetness and Water\nhttps://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=28648&start=20\nMalcolm:\nWhat do you mean by \"nature?\" Most people mean something that is intrinsic to a given thing. For\nexample, common people assume the nature of fire is heat, the nature of water is wetness, and so on.\nBhavaviveka, etc., do not accept that things have natures. If they did, they could not be included even in\nMahāyāna, let alone Madhyamaka.\n...\nThe idea that things have natures is refuted by Nāgārjuna in the MMK, etc., Bhavaviveka, Candrakīrti, etc.,\nin short by all Madhyamakas.\nA \"non-inherent nature\" is a contradiction in terms.\nThe error of mundane, conventionally-valid perception is to believe that entities have natures, when in\nfact they do not, being phenomena that arise from conditions. It is quite easy to show a worldly person\nthe contradiction in their thinking. Wetness and water are not two different things; therefore wetness is\nnot the nature of water. Heat and fire are not two different things, therefore, heat is not the nature of fire,\netc. For example, one can ask them, \"Does wetness depend on water, or water on wetness?\" If they claim\nwetness depends on water, ask them, where is there water that exists without wetness? If they claim the\nopposite, that water depends on wetness, ask them, where is there wetness that exists without water? If\nthere is no wetness without water nor water without wetness, they can easily be shown that wetness is\nnot a nature of water, but merely a name for the same entity under discussion. Thus, the assertion that\nwetness is the nature of water cannot survive analysis. The assertion of all other natures can be\neliminated in the same way.\n...\nThen not only are you ignorant of the English language, but you are ignorant of Candrakīrti where, in the\nPrasannapāda, he states that the only nature is the natureless nature, emptiness.\nThen, if it is asked what is this dharmatā of phenomena, it is the essence of phenomena. If it is ask what is\nan essence, it is a nature [or an inherent existence, rang bzhin]. If it is asked what is an inherent existence\n309\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n[or nature], it is emptiness. If it is asked what is emptiness, it is naturelessness [or absence of inherent\nexistence]. If it is asked what is the absence of inherent existence [or naturelessness], it is suchness\n[tathāta]. If it is asked what is suchness, it is the essence of suchness that is unchanging and permanent,\nthat is, because it is not fabricated it does not arise in all aspects and because it is not dependent, it is\ncalled the nature [or inherent existence] of fire, etc.\"\nLabels: Ācārya Malcolm Smith, Emptiness, Madhyamaka |\nMipham: Gelug = Svatantrika Madhyamaka - Page 2 - Dharma Wheel\nDHARMAWHEEL.NET\nMipham: Gelug = Svatantrika Madhyamaka - Page 2 - Dharma Wheel\nMipham: Gelug = Svatantrika Madhyamaka - Page 2 - Dharma Wheel\n1\n· Reply\n· Remove Preview\n· 5d\nSoh Wei YuAdmin\nTherefore one should not reify consciousness into an entity, or a universal cosmic entity or ultimate Self,\nbut rather see that it cannot be abstracted out from moment to moment manifestation.

Allow to be and completely let go. For what is \"What Is\"\nwhen the senses are suspended and perceptions, conceRpts and feelings come to a complete rest? Be Non-dual\nin dreamless, be non-dual in all 3 states and the energy you experienced will dance vibrantly with bliss to tell that\nyou are on the right path during waking state.”\nSleep disruptions can occur after I AM, or even one mind. This was not a major issue for Soh (it surfaced\nonly to a minor degree), but some people like John Tan and others faced it. One should relax and let go\n311\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nrather than focus on sustaining presence or a state of witnessing into sleep. Natural non-dual or clear light\nsleep does manifest in sleep naturally after anatta is stabilized, but it is different from the contrived state\nof effortful sustaining of dualistic witnessing presence which can cause sleep disruptions and insomnia,\nand one should definitely not mistaken the grasping at a sense of wakefulness (which is actually a form of\ninsomnia and sleep disruption) as a form of achievement.\nIf one gets stuck with insomnia after I AM/Eternal Witness, it can only be truly solved after realizing John\nTan Stage 5. And with regards to the ‘Witness’, John Tan wrote before in 2008, “There is no problem being\nthe witness, the problem is only wrong understanding of what witness is. That is [under the influence of\nignorance, one is] seeing duality in Witnessing, or seeing 'Self' and other, subject-object division. That is\nthe problem. You can call it Witnessing or Awareness, there must be no sense of self.”\nI have seen so many famous masters and practitioners who have completely mistaken that remaining\nconscious into deep sleep is a form of achievement. Many masters in various traditions, such as Advaita,\nTibetan, Zen, Thai Forest and so on may see being conscious in sleep as an ultimate achievement, the prized\n‘Turiya’ (fourth state) transcending and underlying the transient states of waking, dreaming and sleep. In\nactuality, not being able to fall asleep completely and being always conscious even when sleeping (what\nRamana calls sleepless sleep, wakeful sleep) is an energy imbalance, and it is harmful to one’s health. As\nJohn Tan warned, “You realize everyone that claims this ended up having serious health issues.’”, “just don't\nmistaken all these energy imbalances as achievement. Look at all these issues directly and know how to\ndeal with it.”\nAccording to John Tan, to prevent energy imbalances in I AM phase, non-doership and calmness it extremely\nkey. There must be a balance.\nIn 2007, John Tan translated a paragraph from English to Chinese. It was a passage he wrote about I AMness\nas the changeless ground of being, ending it with an additional comment, “Due to the strong karmic\npropensities to grasp at a substance of awareness, the practitioner may have difficulties falling asleep, and\nin serious cases may obtain insomnia, being unable to fall asleep for many years.” He wrote that and told\nme to send it along with the Thusness (John Tan) Stages of Enlightenment to a dharma teacher as that\ndharma teacher was suffering from insomnia due to energy imbalance after I AMness. To truly solve this\nissue, one must be able to relinquish one’s grasping at Awareness (reified as a Self) and give rise to John\nTan Stage 5 insight of anatta.\n“Once a practitioner deeply experiences the illusoriness of “self/self-image”, the illusory “self-image”\ndissolves like a river merges into the great ocean, dissolving without a trace. This moment is also the arising\nof the Great Self. This Great Self is pure, mystically alive, clear and bright, just like an empty space-mirror\nreflecting the ten thousand things. The coming and going, birth and death, rise and fall, the ten thousand\nevents and ten thousand phenomena simply arise and cease according to conditions as illusory\nmanifestations appearing from within the ground-substratum of the Great Self. The ground-substratum\n312\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nnever gets affected, is still and without movement, without coming and without going. This Great Self is the\nAtman-Brahman, God-Self.\nCommentary: Practitioners should not mistaken this as the True Buddha Mind! Due to the karmic force of\ngrasping at a substance of awareness, a practitioner may have difficulty entering sleep, and in serious cases\nmay experience insomnia, the inability to fall asleep for many years.” – John Tan, 2007\n“As long as she knows where she is and aim for stage 5.5, she will be able to cure her sleeping problem. :)”\n- John Tan, 2007\n“(11:46 PM) Thusness: X has not experienced non dual. that is why there is a sleeping problem. :P and\nshe must take it as a misunderstanding of consciousness. this latent sleeping problem can only be solved\nby stage 5 and 6. this also means that she has not experienced wu wei fa also. contrary to what she wrote.\nbut not to talk about stage.

Not suitable for lay person that has\nwork imo. You also need to have exercises to keep your qi circulating.\"\nBen Miles\nThat is interesting. Did John mention his reasons for saying this?

Realization of anatta was crucial to that\nresolution, hence the comment ‘when [one is] at [stage] 5.5, her problem will be solved’.\n“(10:09 PM) John: yes it is still if we want to call it, the 'Self' but when emptiness comes into\npicture...Presence takes another role... look at buddhism closely...there is no need for emptiness and non-\ninherent existence if it is merely 'Self'. it is all about the clarity of our true nature. if we call our true nature\nthe true 'Self', it is alright...but what is the relationship of emptiness? it is more like God. that does not\nrequire conditions, just the source will do. :) \"I AMness\" lead to that sort of presence....anatta even\nworse...greater clarity. kundalini awakening the serpent also will lead to this cosmic consciousness\nexperience, but the emptiness nature isn't seen.\n(10:14 PM) AEN: kundalini awakening how come also can\n(10:14 PM) AEN: isnt it some kind of chakra thing?\n(10:14 PM) John: because of the release of energy that cause a sudden drop out of all barriers\n(10:14 PM) AEN: btw j krishnamurti attain enlightenment through kundalini i tink.. he mention\n(10:15 PM) John: yes...every chakra is a release and melting away, and the release till a free and pure\nsense of energetic sense of awareness. union with cosmic consciousness, so called. the presence can be so\nintense that you don't know how to deal with it. :) it penetrate to the sleeping phase” – Conversation with\nJohn Tan, 2006\n\"To find one that can completely surrender and totally be is extremely rare. Not even one in millions. Yet in\ndeep sleep, all has to let go. How can one be denied such a precious state of beingness.\nFor a person that has experienced no-self (non-duality), deep sleep is even more important. It is the\ncompletion of a full cycle of non-duality and natural beingness.\nBut this may not be the case for one that clings to the \"Eternal Witnessing\". There is a very subtle holding\nin them for maintaining this witnessing subconsciously thereby denying them from naturally going into\ndeep sleep. If it reaches a point that presents itself as a problem, it is a signal to the practitioner that it is\n314\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ntime to let go and dissolve the holding of the Witness, the center. It will be tough to simply try just \"let go\"\nof the center and if this is the case, an insight into our \"emptiness nature\" may help.\nOnly after going through a full cycle of natural non-duality and beingness in all three states (waking,\ndreaming and deep sleep) will a practitioner sleep be shortened. I called this the second cycle of non-\nduality.\" - John Tan, 2007\n“There is no need to maintain anything during deep sleep. It is non-dual by itself.

It is really just a\nline, a definition, a mind made map that attempts to locate awareness as 'not that but this', 'not there but\nhere', etc.\nWhen insight into nature of awareness arise, then one is able to overcome the tendency of locating\nawareness anywhere besides manifestation. Then you will love to just sleep when you sleep, in hearing\njust sound, in sleeping just sleep, because that's always what's already the case -- never a seer or a seeing\nbesides.\nAfter that 'confirmation' is always auto confirmation by the ten thousand things and auto release (self\nliberation) upon arising, in fact non arising in its arising.

An illumination into the non-duality without\ncertain pre-requisite can cause problems. There is always habitual propensities that will again make this\nexperience an object of attachment. It can cause a person to go without sleep as the body is incapable of\ndealing with this newfound experience. Many have mistaken this to be a heightening of awareness and\ntook it as a natural progression. This is not true.

A wrong understanding. After non-dual and with right\nunderstanding, only manifestation with right condition is necessary. It's holding on to 'witnessing' that is\ndenying the further experience of our pristine nature. :)” - John Tan, 2007\n“(1:52 PM) Thusness: don't become zoombie that's all. :) Clarity manifest after unconsciousness at\nthe right time. :) The holding back is a subtle attachment. You must die to get rebirth. :) Does deep sleep\ncreates clarity. :) Maintaining witnessing is not observing the conditions of the body. :) that is not allowing\n321\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nconditions to be and manifest. :) “knowingness\" is not holding on and not to get subsided. :P it is to \"be\" as\n\"unconscious\". :) It is a difficult state to describe. :) Not to take it as in the \"conscious knowing\". :)\n(1:58 PM) AEN: I see.. By the way is it mindfulness would lead to mirror bright but not necessary non dual?\nI think you said something like that or I may be wrong\n(1:59 PM) Thusness: yes. But it will if the intensity sharpen till it is able to realise that manifestation is. Now\nis nirodha samapatti \"knowing\"? Does a person know when in that state? It is just 'that' state. :) Nothing\nelse.\n(2:02 PM) AEN: oic.. but there is luminosity isn’t it\n(2:02 PM) Thusness: as in?\n(2:02 PM) AEN: as in the luminous aspect our buddha nature\n(2:03 PM) Thusness: ahahha.... you cannot understand because you still hold on to 'knowingness'. :)\n(2:15 PM) Thusness: it is a lil deep for you now... :) Even for longchen (Sim Pern Chong) it is deep. But he is\nsafe for now. :) I hope he takes my words seriously with the passing away. The second door. But I do not\nwant you to get into what ken wilber described. :) That is the problem of X. :) With the condition of a body,\nmanifest along with the condition of a body. Just like the 'eye' can only 'see' certain range, let it be. Not to\nstrain the eyes for what it is not. :) But in each experience, discern with clarity the luminous presence.\n(2:20 PM) AEN: I see.. By the way you mean if practise like ken wilber will lead to dark night? then ken wilber\nand X got dark night meh? (Comments by Soh: referring to Ken Wilber’s article about maintaining constant\nconsciousness and being awake without sleep for over a week, which I only come to realise many years down the\nroad after facing similar issues myself, is actually insomnia and energy imbalance in disguise of spiritual\nachievement in the name of ‘Turiya’)\n(2:26 PM) Thusness: yes.\n(2:26 PM) AEN: huh.. not that I know haha\n(2:27 PM) Thusness: because you don't know. :P\n(2:27 PM) AEN: then X got dark night? how will it be like\n(2:27 PM) Thusness: err… you never see ken wilber so siong. :P\n(2:27 PM) AEN: how\n(2:28 PM) Thusness: No worries. No need to think too much.\n(5:30 PM) Thusness: guessed a bit of cautioning is necessary. :)\n(5:31 PM) Thusness: yes. :) Not the witnessing as said by Ken Wilber. That is not necessary and misleading.\nThe misconception, attachment and fear resist the dissolution. Not to be misled. :)\n(5:33 PM) Thusness: i have said many times it is not and posted and told you the importance of sleep. It is\nlike a kind of samadhi. :) Always measure by clarity, vividness and radiance. When you sleep well and\ncompletely dreamless, don't you feel these 3 factors are clear and strong?\n(5:35 PM) AEN: you mean you can??\n322\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(5:35 PM) Thusness: i think we spoke on maintaining witnessing during sleep before in another post. I said\ndon't go into it.\n(5:39 PM) Thusness: lol. Non dual has no separation. Sometimes when I typed too fast and combine 2\nsentences into one. :P But I think I said not to do that and maintain witnessing in one of the post you asked.\nNon duality has no-separation, it is that state as it is. When it is in waking, it is the phenomena arising. The\nso called 'thing' itself.\n(5:45 PM) AEN:\nYes Longchen,\nVery well said. There never was a gap, it can't be. It is one whole flow and nothing else. When there is one,\nthere is two. When the one subsides, nothing isn't the one Reality.\nClear transparency of the One Reality also has its problem. An illumination into the non-duality without\ncertain pre-requisite can cause problems. There is always habitual propensities that will again make this\nexperience an object of attachment. It can cause a person to go without sleep as the body is incapable of\ndealing with this newfound experience. Many have mistaken this to be a heightening of awareness and\ntook it as a natural progression. This is not true. Whenever this happens, know that it is due to attachment.\nLearn how to let go of everything until a tranquil calmness arise, it has got to do with our thought patterns,\nthere must come this willingness to let go of our body completely, then our thoughts and the experience\nof presence...completely letting go from moment to moment...the senses and thoughts can be shut by this\nart of letting go and non-attachment. Total letting go and\n(5:46 PM) AEN: Total letting go and vivid Presence must fuse into one.\nPractice during the waking state till the there is no single trace of doubt that there is absolutely no one\nthere, no inner and no outer, just the incredible realness and vividness of the manifestation. The experience\nof non-dual in the waking state. Witnessing dreams and there is no witness, just dreams is different. Dealing\nwith the more subtle states and pre-conscious propensities require one to master this art of non-\nattachment, non-action. There is no conscious way of dealing with the more subtle states, just stabilized\nthe experience and allow the momentum to carry us naturally into the dream and deep sleep. Sleep well. :)\n(5:47 PM) Thusness: yes. very clear what :P\n(5:48 PM) Thusness: That is precisely what I meant. 'Be' Dreamless. The cognitive mind cannot know.\nThere is no conscious way of dealing with the more subtle states, just stabilize the experience and allow\nthe momentum to carry us naturally into the dream and deep sleep. No-conscious way… don't maintain\nthat 'witnessing'. The conscious mind will only come to know about it when the 7 factors of enlightenment\nis enhanced during waking state. That is the problem faced by X also. The ‘jue’ (awareness) went deep into\nher. Being subtly attached to the 'Witnessing', she is unable to 'be' when the conditions of sleep manifest.\n323\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(5:58 PM) Thusness: still not good enough. See now she understand there is no mirror at all. She somehow\nknow the problem but isn't clear.\n(6:01 PM) Thusness: yes. But there is experience of Presence. A mirror but not attached to the reflection,\nto there is no mirror! Only manifestation alone is. Completely break that mirror. Then that is non-dual. The\nconditions are there for X if she wrote what you said. If she has the 'yuan' (conditions) she will understand.\nGive her the English version will be better and let her decode herself instead. :P or let her write the next\narticle. “There is no-mirror”.... hahaha\n(8:25 PM) Thusness: “Mindfulness is participatory observation. The meditator is both participant and\nobserver at one and the same time. If one watches one's emotions or physical sensations, one is feeling\nthem at that very same moment. Mindfulness is not an intellectual awareness. It is just awareness. The\nmirror-thought metaphor breaks down here. Mindfulness is objective, but it is not cold or unfeeling.\n(8:25 PM) Thusness: It is the wakeful experience of life, an alert participation in the ongoing process of\nliving. “ - An excerpt from Mindfulness in Plain English by Venerable Henepola Gunaratana,\nhttps://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed005.htm\n(8:25 PM) Thusness: This is very good. But there is still trace of duality. It is very difficult to go beyond it\nand say phenomena is it. Therefore what that is taught and proclaimed in Lankavatara Sutra is often not\nrealised. It is very difficult for one to experience the transparency I am talking about. Once experienced, all\nwill be very clear. Perhaps the only one that can break through is longchen [Sim Pern Chong]. This is if he\ncan non-dual in all three states (waking, dreaming, deep sleep) and let be. Then at the waking state, the\npresence can be so powerful that there is no boundary at all. The body is a total non-obstruction and the\nPresence stands out as if consciousness is out of the body and phenomena alone is. The body thing\nrequires one to experience non-dual and be in all three states. Then the waking state becomes powerfully\ncharged with presence, vitality, clarity and radiance. If one can sustain this continuously then \"transparency\nbody\" is attained. :) This is what I mean the transcendental body.” - John Tan, 2007\n“John: yes the description is the experience of I AM. hahaha..\nSoh: because someone quoted this guy in e-sangha, and said he is wakeful even in sleep\nJohn: almost all that is described points to it. But what you cut and paste doesn't sound like.\nSoh: so I shared some of what you said regarding dangers of witnessing in sleep\nI see. how come?\nJohn: that is the usual case. however if one experiences non-dual, then this sort of 'wakefulness' is gone.\nwakefulness at night is gone. it is different from true mindfulness where one completely loses the sense of\nself...like buddha having 2hrs sleep. that is different...don't anyhow anyhow mix the 2. the former is a form\nof [being] unable to handle the propensities and doesn't know what to do.\n324\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\ntakes many many years to overcome. and she found it as a problem too. true mindfulness and alertness is\ndifferent. and almost everyone that goes through 'I AMness' have sort of this problem.\n(Comments by Soh: John suffered serious energy imbalances and insomnia for like a decade or more after\nhis I AMness realization, and it was only solved after his realization of anatta. This is why he said ‘this sort\nof ‘wakefulness’ is gone’ - also see chapter on Tips on Energy Imbalances)\nSoh: I see. You as well in the past?\nJohn: this is usual. Yeah. if a person overcome it through insight and enter into non-duality (buddhist no-\nself), then there is overcoming because that propensity that cause the 'sleeplessness' and over conscious\nof the 'I AM' is gone. then come the stage of clarity which is different… and frankly, a person getting peak\nin experience of non-duality will not describe it like that and take 'wakefulness in sleep' as such a big deal.\nhe correctly sees and have insight into the true nature. he will not emphasize this. he will tell you sleep\ninstead! ahahaha\notherwise why you see all those zen masters stressed about simplicity and all great masters talk about\nthat… non-dual is about this. :)\nSoh: I see.. like the when sitting, just sit, when doing this, just do etc\nJohn: when sleeping just sleep. one dissolves and the condition of arising is also realised as the source.” -\nConversation with John Tan, 2007\n“(7:16 PM) John: anyway...sustain of presence of presence can be due to a natural momentum or a very\nsubtle and strong attachment of the 'Self'.\n(7:16 PM) AEN: sustain of presence of presence?\n(7:16 PM) AEN: icic\n(7:17 PM) John: that is, in dreamless state, it can be due to the unwillingness of letting as a result of subtle\nattachment. most likely the case. it is not natural momentum.\n(7:17 PM) AEN: you have experienced tat in the past?\n(7:17 PM) John: the letting go into deep sleep is very important and let it turns in naturally. even now.\n(7:17 PM) AEN: huh\n(7:18 PM) AEN: how come\n(7:18 PM) John: it is not easy to differentiate....one has to be utterly truthful. but i have practice the letting\ngo few years back.\n(7:19 PM) AEN: icic...\n(7:19 PM) John: and it helps me to see more clearly instead of being lured into the idea of thinking i have\nachieved great height of attainment. because of our mind is so clear, our sleep actually shorten to very\nfew hours and to enter into deep sleep from that mental alertness isn't easy. we rather meditate. then we\nthought that is a natural state.\n(7:20 PM) AEN: icic\n325\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n(7:21 PM) John: i tried it about 1.5 yrs back and notice the difference.\n(7:21 PM) AEN: tried wat\n(7:21 PM) AEN: meditating ?\n(7:21 PM) John: the body must be completely at rest...that is a pre-condition.\n(7:21 PM) AEN: icic\n(7:21 PM) John: for the body to be completely at rest, you must learn to let go completely... even to\nPresence...\n(7:22 PM) AEN: but presence is a natural state rite?\n(7:22 PM) John: but the letting go of the body is already a great achievement...the strength of calmness\nand letting go somehow let you overcome the attachment to Presence.\n(7:23 PM) AEN: oic..\n(7:23 PM) John: Presence has to be a natural state, it might not be a natural state.\n(7:23 PM) AEN: huh?\n(7:24 PM) John: the experience of true presence has to be as natural as possible, it is a reflection of our\npurity due to the loosening of our inner bond.\n(7:24 PM) AEN: icic..\n(7:25 PM) John: however for one that has experience presence, he is able to feel the Presence in and out\nlike a deliberate attempt.

Sleep\nOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then,\nwhen the night was fading, the Blessed One, having spent much of the night walking back and forth in the open,\nwashed his feet, entered his dwelling, and lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture, with one leg\noverlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, having attended to the idea of rising.\nThen Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:\n“What, you sleep? Why do you sleep?\nWhat’s this, you sleep like a wretch?\nThinking ‘The hut’s empty’ you sleep:\nWhat’s this, you sleep when the sun has risen?”\nThe Blessed One:\n“Within him craving no longer lurks,\nEntangling and binding, to lead him anywhere;\nWith the destruction of all acquisitions\nThe Awakened One sleeps:\nWhy should this concern you, Mara?”\nThen Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.\n- https://suttacentral.net/sn4.7/en/bodhi\nWhen hungry, eat;\nTired, sleep.\nFools laugh at me,\nBut the wise know its wisdom.\n- Ch’an/Zen Master Linji Xiyuan\n“John: when the self subsides yet just the sound alone...what is it… when there is just the scenery, what is\n327\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nit? without self. then talk about deep sleep... what is non-dual in deep sleep. otherwise it is still dualistic\nmode of knowing. but it is not the time to tell him yet. :)\nSoh: but anyway non dual in conscious is like 'being' the sound right. so deep sleep..\nJohn: yeah\nSoh: 'being' nothing?\nJohn: you can't know… don't explore\nSoh: so it’s like 'being nothing', right?\nJohn: the problem with people is that there is no point knowing because there is no way to know for now.\nfirst understand and practice. because whatever said is wrong knowledge\nJohn: if you don't even understand what is non dual in waking, how can you keep thinking what is non dual\nin deep sleep.”\nTo emphasize the point, sustaining witnessing presence as in the I AM phase is not the same as non-dual,\nbe it in waking or sleep. For that is still dualistic (a witness that is merely witnessing phenomena from\nbehind - a subject/object, perceiver/perceived duality) and holding tightly onto a form of centricity and\nbackground witnessing can be disruptive to sleep, instead of just sleeping when it’s time to sleep, dissolving\nand fusing with the conditions of sleep, so to speak. Hence, one should first realize non-dual anatta (at least\nJohn Tan/Thusness Stage 5) then let wisdom mature into sleep naturally.\nAs Sim Pern Chong wrote in 2007:\n“Non-duality is NOT the same as a state of Witnessing Presence observing Phenomenality. An Eternal\nWitness Presence that is apart from Phenomena cannot be said to be non dual as there are 2 components\nhere (witness and phenomena). I had this experience before. And now, I must say that true non-duality is\ndistinctively different from this.\nNon duality can only be effortlessly experienced when the 'sense of self' and the 'Eternal Witness' are\ncorrectly understood for what they are.”\n“Many sites I see are full of duality. Thorough non-duality or no-self experience is rare. It will be great if they\ncan describe what the waking state is like after non-dual is experienced in all three states (waking, dreaming\nand deep sleep).” - John Tan, 2007\n328\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n“Issues of sleeplessness are usually more pertinent to those in the I AMness phases, but transient\nepisodes of sleeplessness right after certain breakthroughs in anatta are also common, however they\nusually do not last more than a couple of days especially if one knows how to handle the energy\nimbalances involved, as there is no more clinging to an identity as ‘conscious knowing’ in anatta. Instead\nwhen sleeping one just fully sleeps and when eating one fully eats, etc.” - Soh, 2019\n“(1:42 AM) Thusness: you should sleep. don't worry about people saying you should practice in sleep.\nthere is no practice if you cannot drop. there is no practice if you do not know what non-dual and\nemptiness is. so don't worry about dreams and deep sleep. during waking state, practice these then when\nyou must sleep, go sleep. when you realised emptiness, your 'self' will be gone. you will love sleeping. :)\nyou will love to be gone. :P” - Conversation with John Tan, 2008\n2007: “Jane wrote:\nThere is no static witness behind our experiences.\nNo background.\nThe witness turns out to be everything that is witnessed.\nManifestation is the source the witness.\nThey are not separate.\nAwareness is the words that form on the screen the sound of typing.\nThere is only moment to moment of flow of manifestation.\nNon-duality is not a state it is not an experience.\nIt is the nature of reality of all states.\nthe entry to the gateless gate.\nForm is emptiness and emptiness is form.\nGrimNexus wrote:\nJane,\nNo.\nThe ONE INFINITE EXISTENCE/Awareness Itself does not \"come from\" the Manifestation\nThusness replied:\nHi Grim,\nAs much as I would not like to say, although you have experienced the fruition of ‘seeing’, you have not\nexperienced the fruition of ‘dropping the Self -- The ONE INFINITE EXISTENCE’. If the essence of\nexperiencing manifestation without the background is not fully realized, there is no hope in\nunderstanding the ‘dreamless sleep’. To hold on to a familiar state of awareness that is experienced in\nwaking state and attempt to bring this familiar experience to ‘dreamless sleep’ state is a distortion of what\nawareness is. It is an attempt of our thinking mechanism to replicate to what it thinks 'pure awareness' is\ninto 'dreamless sleep'. If ‘conscious knowing’ does not give way to spontaneity of being no one, then there\n329\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nis no hope in understanding ‘unconsciousness’. Knowingness is the very flow of spontaneous\nmanifestation.\nGood Luck!“\nOn someone facing sleeplessness at the I AM phase, John Tan wrote in 2020, “Because there is\nunwillingness to drop away the background awareness.\nDedicate few months to the practice of belly breathing exercises. With each breath feel the sensations\nand pulsation of the palms and sink into calmness and peace. There is a critical phase where the\n\"thinking\" process and thoughts and whatever are taken over by the flow of the breath and pulsation of\nthe palm...then the issue will be overcome. Once we get used to this technique, we will be able to cease\nthinking process without holding anything, without affirming anything. This art can be mastered without\nmuch difficulty post anatta.\nIt is not easy to overcome such issues that is why I try to prevent you from over focusing on the\nbackground source when you first experienced I AM.”\n“If you can truly 'when sleeping just sleep' without the slightest trace of holding/self/Self, you will not be\ninsomniac, and there will not be energy imbalances. The problem is that one has not fully actualized anatta,\nthere are energy imbalances and other issues causing insomnia..\nOf course there can be other issues involved. I think in Tibetan medicine there is something called Bimala\n( https://www.siddhienergetics.com/products/bimala ) or Aga-35\n( https://www.siddhienergetics.com/products/agar-35 ) which is supposed to be quite effective and a good\nalternative to sleeping pills (I never tried, and don't need it for now). Lopon Malcolm Smith and other\nTibetan masters often recommend either of them to be taken along with a normal 2 oz (2 oz = 59.1471ml)\npour of aged tawny port. On the difference between Bimala vs Agar-35, someone wrote, “For a reliable\nanswer about their differences and when one would be better than the other, you’d need to talk to Malcolm. But\nmy understanding is that Bimala is a bit warming, so good for people who run cold, whereas Agar 35 is more\ncooling, so one is better for certain constitutions than others. Bimala is also specifically indicated for a condition\ncalled “wind in the heart,” which I *think* involves severe depression and a flighty mind. But again, I’d get\nMalcolm’s (or another TM doctor’s) input before choosing which to take.” If you can find a Tibetan medicine\ndoctor, that would be good. These are supposed to help with rlung/wind/vayu/energy issues. There is also\nanother type of Tibetan medicine called Chulen that increases clarity (it is for different purpose than Bimala\nand Agar-35, not for helping sleep). Some Tibetan masters take these pills (bimala/agar/chulen) regularly.\nLopon Malcolm has warned that no Tibetan herbal formulas, apart from Vimala/Bimala (due to its\nsafe and balanced nature), should be taken without seeking advice from a qualified Tibetan doctor.\n(Other recommendations for sleep that I’ve heard from others include Melatonin, Chamomile tea, and L-\nTheanine - however, my sister informed me that although Melatonin is effective it is not so good to take it\n330\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\neveryday, although it’s quite safe for short term use as melatonin is a hormone produced by the body. You\nhave to do your own research and don’t just take my word for it, I am not a medical doctor, these are just\nsuggestions for your research)\n“Alcohol even in small amounts helps to balance the vāyu.” - Kyle Dixon\nJohn Tan also told me that even whiskey is ok as long as it is below 150ml (going above that is going to be\npretty harmful - as a matter of fact, I think 150ml is too much, I think 50ml or less is more than enough)\notherwise it will be harmful - you should definitely go for the lowest effective dosage. It might be helpful\nfor energy issues, especially for the neck. Everything in moderation, even medicines. As you probably know,\nalcohol taken regularly and abusively results in a whole lot of health problems and diseases.\n(note: however it is not so advisable to regularly rely on alcohol for sleep -\n\"According to the findings, alcohol does allow healthy people to fall asleep quicker and sleep more deeply\nfor a while, but it reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. And the more you drink before bed, the more\npronounced these effects. REM sleep happens about 90 minutes after we fall asleep.\" -\nhttps://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20130118/alcohol-sleep)\nSo chulen is like the herbal upper while aga35 and bimala is the herbal downer (well not literally, I don’t\nthink they necessarily take effect immediately like western drugs that cause an instant release of\nneurotransmitters in the brain, but gradually treats the energetic imbalances of the body by addresses the\nroot causes, so they cannot be compared that way) but supposedly with less side effects and more helpful\nfor one’s energy. Lopon Malcolm who is a qualified Tibetan medicine practitioner as well, and many other\nrinpoches warned against some of the harmful effects of taking pharmaceuticals such as sleeping pills (and\nother psychotropic drugs) on a regular basis, plus they often lead to dependency.\nI do not endorse any of these (bimala/aga/chulen) as I only tried chulen for some time and I have not tried\nagar/bimala. Many people vouch for it, so I’m just mentioning it here for people to do their own research\nand make their own decision. It is my opinion and John Tan’s opinion that traditional medicines (whether\nTibetan or Chinese) can be better at treating some of the health issues (including rlung/wind/energy). Of\ncourse, western medical advances are very good at many things, but John Tan often noted the negative\nside effects while taking them (e.g. “like killing all my body cells… destroying my energy system… lol”). If you\nhave a health issue that is not life threatening (cancer, etc) and can afford some time to try out the\nTibetan/Chinese traditional medicines, they can sometimes offer a better solution. Do note however that I\nam not trying to sow distrust in western medicines. John and I do use western medicines when needed.\nHowever John Tan also said in 2016, “I prefer Chinese medicine that aims to let the body naturally heal itself\nby promoting circulation… though it takes longer but you feel well.” Also, as this article advises (this is\nespecially true for serious ailments): “Alternative medicine therapies may improve health for those with\ncancer, but they should always be used in conjunction with standard medical care.” -\n331\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nhttps://www.livescience.com/16551-steve-jobs-alternative-medicine-pancreatic-cancer-treatment.html ” -\nSoh, 2019\n(Note: Serious energy imbalances related to depression and anxiety and traumas should be treated with\nthe expert help of psychiatrists and psychologists, possibly with the medications as support. Modern\nmedicine can be a vital and important part of healing and should never be downplayed. If you exhibit\nsymptoms that may be related to these, you should be checked out by professionals.\nIn Soh's case of 7 days of energy imbalances in 2019, it was not related to mental issues as there was no\ndepression, sad mood, or mental anxiety (aside from bodily sensations of tensions), nor was it related to\ntraumas, but instead it was due to extreme intensity of luminosity - an intensity that persists throughout\nthe day and into sleep, and an energy pattern of overfocusing and tenseness that was difficult to dissolve.\nThat said, if you are unsure, it's better to get checked out. Additionally, you can also check out books by\nJudith Blackstone, which goes deeply into trauma release and relates it with nondual practice (although not\nexactly based on anatta practice, still it is worth reading). See:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/06/good-book-on-healing-trauma-and-nondual.html\nJohn Tan also said, “There is a big difference between depressions caused by work or physical\nappearances or lack of family support...etc and issues for example related to \"I AM\". All those anxieties\nthat relate to physical appearances or work load or studies etc will gradually release if the respective\nissues are solved. But there are issues that are like \"I AM\" that is your first immediate thought, so close\nand so immediate that are not easy to \"rid\".”\n“Some (energy imbalances) may relate to opening of certain energy gates when body is not ready also.”)\nThe topic of how non-dual and no-self is experienced in sleep is dealt more fully in the “Penetration of\nWisdom into Sleep” section of this document.\nHere’s more descriptions about the efficacy of Bimala, etc:\n“If you have difficulty sleeping at night, there are other practices you may employ to assist you. For example,\nhaving this difficulty often means that you need to coordinate the energy and function of the different\nelements within your body. If your energy is disordered, it prevents you from sleeping. In this case, a deep\nbreathing practice done repeatedly can be beneficial. You might do the nine-fold purification\nbreathing8before going to sleep. There are also physical exercises such as a series of eight movements9\nfound in Yantra Yoga that can help develop your capacity for correct breathing and also balance your\nenergies as an aid to sleeping. In addition, there are Tibetan medicines to assist a person who has difficulty\nsleeping. Unlike sleeping pills they do not cause dependence or other side effects.\n332\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\nThese medicines, such as Agar 35 and Vimala,10 can be used for one or two months—as long as you need,\nreally—and will not cause any negative side effects. Rather, they will help your health and coordinate your\nenergy. When you do not need the medicine anymore, you can stop without withdrawal symptoms or\nnegative effects. That is the benefit of these Tibetan medicines.\nIf you have become habituated to Western sleeping pills, you can initially alternate them with Tibetan pills\nin order to lessen the dependency. One night you use Western medicine, and the next night you use Agar\n35. After one or two weeks of alternating, you will be able to stop taking the Western medicine without a\nproblem.\nYou must not think only of Tibetan medicine when it comes to assuring a good night’s sleep. You should\nalso work with breathing in the manner previously mentioned, as this is very related to sleep.\nSometimes you cannot sleep because one of your three humors11 is disturbed. When the wind humor is\ndisturbed one has particular trouble sleeping. Wind is linked with prana or energy. When prana is disturbed\nit is difficult to sleep. For more information on this you can consult books on Tibetan medicine. In a book I\nwrote12 on the topic there is an explanation of the three humors and of how to overcome problems. For\nexample, to overcome problems related to wind disease, it is helpful to go to bed earlier in the evening, to\nsleep with warm clothes, and to have something like soup to eat just before going to bed. If you are not\nsleeping at night, and instead of relaxing you work hard until late hours, or you eat raw vegetables, this\nmay further aggravate the condition. There are many things to learn in Tibetan medical books.\nEverything is related. First try these preparations so you can fall asleep. If you have succeeded, then you\ncan do the practice of the night. If your situation is between falling asleep immediately, and not being able\nto fall asleep, then visualize a white “A” or “A”, but one that is not very bright. If you have a problem falling\nasleep, you must not visualize the white “A” as too bright, and you could also visualize it in a sphere of five\ncolors. This makes it easier to fall asleep. There are many kinds of people and many situations; we should\nknow about all of them.\n- Dzogchen teacher Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light\n\" You should take Vimala about an hour before sleeping.\nWhy are you taking magnesium citrate?\nYou should seperate Vimala from Magnesium citrate by about an hour. Vimala may be used as needed. It\ncan be made a little more effective by taking it with warm milk or a small spot of brandy, port, or other aged\nalchohol. Vimala may also be taken early in the morning to calm anxiety.\nN\" - malcolm, 2011\n333\nSTAGE 1: I AM / Eternal Witness\n\" Mostly because in Tibetan medicine we don't load up on pills all at the same time.\nThe purpose of Vimala is to help one sleep and otherwise reduce symptoms of vata disturbances.\"\n\" Pema Rigdzin wrote:\nNamdrol,\nWould it be OK to take semde in the a.m. and vimala at bedtime?\nI ask because nearly a month of taking vimala every night has resolved my anxiety pretty much entirely,\nbut while it's really taken the edge off my depression, it still lingers on.\nMalcolm: Yes. Take semde in the am.\"\n\"Malcolm: If you have an anxiety disorder, you should try and speak to a qualified TM [tibetan medicine]\npractitioner.\"\n\" Re: Bimala\nPost by Malcolm » Sat Mar 17, 2012 11:17 pm\ntreehuggingoctopus wrote:\nThank you guys.

His main Dzogchen\nteachers are Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and the late Kunzang Dechen Lingpa. He is a veteran of a traditional\nthree-year solitary Tibetan Buddhist retreat, a published translator of Tibetan Buddhist texts, and was\nawarded the Acharya degree by the Sakya Institute in 2004. He graduated in 2009 from Shang Shung\nInstitute’s School of Tibetan Medicine. He has worked on translations for renowned lamas since 1992,\nincluding His Holiness Sakya Trizin, Kyabgön Phakchok Rinpoche, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, Khenpo Migmar\nTseten, Tulku Dakpa Rinpoche, Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen Rinpoche and many others. \"\nMalcolm smith was also asked to teach dzogchen by his guru kunzang dechen lingpa who attained rainbow\nbody/full awakening/buddhahood\n334\nSTAGE 2: I AM Everything\n[1:27 PM, 8/23/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Description from https://www.siddhienergetics.com/collections/mood-\nsleep\nMood & Sleep\nTibetan herbal medicine excels at bringing the body’s energies into harmony, and thereby helping with such\ncommon complaints as mood disturbance and sleep issues. According to Tibetan medical theory,\ndepression and insomnia stem from the same source: a disturbance in the energy system of the body.\nThese energies, known in Tibetan as rLung, should be centered and anchored in the belly region – the\nfamous ‘hara’ of the Japanese martial arts. Unfortunately, due to the incredibly stressful, complex life of us\nhere in the modern West, the rLung gets stirred up and looses its connection to the abdomen. When this\nhappens, it begins to flow upward toward the head, causing all kinds of disorders, including anxiety,\nexhaustion, mood disturbance and depression, insomnia, and racing thoughts.\nWhen brought back into alignment through the use of herbal formulas such as Agar 35 and Semde, the\nresult is an empowered, focused, relaxed and less defended state of mind. Chronic problems like insomnia\nand anxiety are reduced and sometimes disappear entirely. One feels more in control and thus, able to\ndeal with life’s turbulence. A Tibetan doctor once told me that in hundreds of patient visits he had never\nmet a Westerner whose subtle energy was not disturbed and who could not, therefore, benefit from these\nformulas.”\nFor a practice on regulating energy through vase breathing that brings rLung/wind/energy back to the\ndantien, refer to the Vase Breathing instructions in the Tips on Energy Imbalances chapter.\n(For more information, see chapter: Tips on Energy Imbalances)\nSTAGE 2: I AM Everything\n“I am the rain\nI am the sky\nI am the ‘blueness’\nThe color of the sky\nNothing is more real than the I\nTherefore Buddha, I am I.”\n- John Tan, 2006\n335\nSTAGE 2: I AM Everything\n“It is bringing this I AM into everything. I AM the I in you. The I in the cat, the I in the bird. I AM the first\nperson in everyone and Everything. I. That is my second phase. That the I is ultimate and universal.” - John\nTan, 2013\n“Stage 2 is like non-dual and sunk back to a source. It is always the source, the Self, the background, even\nif you fuse and merge into everything.” - John Tan, 2007\n\"Indirectly, you are aware of the Unmanifested in and through the sensory realm. In other words, you feel\nthe God-essence in every creature, every flower, every stone, and you realize: `All that is, is holy.\" This is\nwhy Jesus, speaking entirely from his essence or Christ identity, says in the Gospel of Thomas: \"Split a\npiece of wood; I am there. Lift up a stone, and you will find me there.\" - Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now\n“Observer and observed as one is non-dual experience. Stage 2 is non-dual but there is no insight of no-\nself. Insight is [that] you know and understand the pathless path of no-self. You see it although it is\npathless. You see the path. This is due to insight and therefore there is more permanent lucidity. Stage 2\nremains as a stage - you don't know how to get it. Don't know when it comes again or the path towards it.\nLongchen (Sim Pern Chong) knows it but needs to further refine it by penetrating into the deeper depth\nof non-dual and into anatta as stated in the bahiya sutta, then comes emptiness. So you understand\nmore about the various stages? Stage 1 can be very blissful too when the meditative strength is there, but\nthere is no understanding of the 'forms. Only the pure sense of existence in thought realm. Not in the\n'forms'. You should know by now. It is difficult for people who have no experience to know what I meant.\nBut when you have experienced, you will know what I meant.”\n- John Tan, 2008\nThis is Stage 2: https://www.facebook.com/521855784/posts/10156891243275785/\n“Although in my I AM phase, if you look into my e-journal, I went through the phase of impersonality\nwhere the I turns universal, I think it is not the full blown Stage 2.\nJohn Tan did not want to lead me too deeply into I AM as he was worried that he will have a hard time\ngetting me 'out of it' because the I AM is seen as ultimate.\nBut the I turning universal is natural also for one who matures the four aspects of I AM, but with the\npointers in the AtR guide there won't be much danger of continuously reifying and creating abstractions.\nIt is the way to nondual along with the nondual contemplations.\nJohn TanFriday, February 21, 2014 at 9:22pm UTC+08\nAlso I did not lead you to I AM everything.\nSoh Wei YuFriday, February 21, 2014 at 9:26pm UTC+08\noic.. how is I AM everything like?\nJohn TanFriday, February 21, 2014 at 9:28pm UTC+08\nIt is bringing this I AM into everything.

Instead of dissolving subject/object division.\nI am the phase. That is my second phase. That the I is ultimate and universal. For you, after direct\napprehension of Awareness, I think there is no point to further strengthen this tendency to that level.” –\nSoh, 2020\n[4:14 pm, 09/05/2022] John Tan: Stage 2 is different. You should not assume from a non-dual or anatta\nperspective in stage 2. In order words, the idea of \"de-construction\" is not present at that point in time.\nYou didn’t actually go through that also. I told you not to extrapolate. For stage 2, it is very focused on\nthe “I AM”. The \"mind\" has a non-dual experience but it couldn't understand it. So the mind projects the\nvery \"I\" in me is the very \"I\" in you; Is the “I AM” in yin ling; is the “I AM” of my dog, the “I AM” in the fish\nswimming.\n[4:17 pm, 09/05/2022] John Tan: Then we project a even bigger \"I\" being multiplied as “I AM” in all these\nindividual “I AM” and equate that with \"God\".\n[4:18 pm, 09/05/2022] John Tan: There is no de-construction of mental constructs, opposite in fact. An\ninfinite multiplication of that \"I\".\nSTAGE 3: Entering into Nothingness\nI (Soh) did not go through this phase in his practice. By practicing the four aspects of I AM and nondual\ncontemplations/bahiya sutta, I skipped from I AM into non dual and then anatta. Should one bypass this\nphase 3? John Tan sometimes seem to imply I am missing out something, but he also told me that I do\nnot need to promote this phase when sharing with others.\n337\nSTAGE 3: Entering into Nothingness\nPhase 3 is about entering into a state of oblivion to get rid of the sense of “I”. In this phase, John Tan “came\nto one important understanding – The ‘I’ is the root cause of all artificialities, true freedom is in spontaneity.\nSurrender into complete nothingness and everything is simply Self So.” - John Tan, 2006\n\"Associating 'death of I' with vivid luminosity of your experience is far too early. This will lead you into\nerroneous views because there is also the experience of practitioners by way of complete surrendering or\nelimination (dropping) like Taoist practitioners. An experience of deep bliss that is beyond that of what you\nexperienced can occur. But the focus is not on luminosity but effortlessness, naturalness and spontaneity.\nIn complete giving up, there is no 'I' ; it is also needless to know anything; in fact 'knowledge' is considered\na stumbling block. The practitioner drops away mind, body, knowledge...everything. There is no insight,\nthere is no luminosity there is only total allowing of whatever that happens, happen in its own accord. All\nsenses including consciousness are shut and fully absorbed. Awareness of 'anything' is only after emerging\nfrom that state.\nOne is the experience of vivid luminosity while the other is a state of oblivious. It is therefore not\nappropriate to relate the complete dissolving of 'I' with what you experienced alone.\" - John Tan, 2008\n“Yes Tyler, the mysterious pass. It can only come as a \"leap over\" because it can't be approached with a\n\"known mind\". Therefore the mysterious gate is dark. So subjective radiance from one's clarity is secondary,\nentirely not a concern at all. When we look at the idea of Mu and the technique of koan, it is not difficult to\nsee that zen is a crossbreed...lol” – John Tan, 2018\n“[22/4/18, 8:40:51 PM] John Tan: Lately I kept seeing articles and conversations relating to \"nothingness\"\nwonder why. The mysterious gate of taoism.\n[22/4/18, 8:42:31 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. maybe you should write something about it.. lol\n[22/4/18, 8:44:36 PM] John Tan: Lol...Taoist valley spirit is the opposite of clarity...it attempts to express the\ndepth \"source\" of life.\n[22/4/18, 8:47:18 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. sounds like Christianity? Was reading some Christian mystic website\nI think based on Father Thomas keating. They are aware of I AM and witnessing but states that the goal of\nChristian contemplation is beyond that, is the source of that and will and doing\n[22/4/18, 8:47:21 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Or something like that\n[22/4/18, 8:47:45 PM] John Tan: Nothingness.

They call it contemplative prayer\n[22/4/18, 8:49:55 PM] Soh Wei Yu: More like prayer.. or meditation.. dunno what is it. Maybe surrendering\n[22/4/18, 8:50:08 PM] John Tan: Yes. The tao is the way. The way of always in Union with the \"source\". Or\neven yoga. One has to be aware of this dimension but nothing to seek. It is rather only in daily encounter\nand manifestation\n[22/4/18, 8:55:00 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Union with source is like divine happening? Not my will but the source\n338\nSTAGE 3: Entering into Nothingness\n[22/4/18, 8:56:12 PM] John Tan: Yes but we cannot approach the \"unfathomable depth\" through \"knowing\".\nonly moment to moment gnosis in seeing, feeling, thinking, tasting, hearing and smelling.\n[22/4/18, 8:57:30 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Knowing as in intellect?\n[22/4/18, 8:58:51 PM] John Tan: Yes intellect. The way to understanding the nature of aliveness and clarity\nis to fully \"live\" and \"express\".\n[22/4/18, 8:59:00 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n[22/4/18, 9:00:01 PM] John Tan: Taoism is unique in this sense in expressing this dark illumination\n[22/4/18, 9:03:33 PM] Soh Wei Yu: How is it unique?\n[22/4/18, 9:09:19 PM] John Tan: it is not really interest in presence. But what is behind presence...when in\ndeep sleep, where is awareness? So the valley spirit is often described as dark. How is this different from\nanatta?\n[22/4/18, 9:24:30 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Anatta does not see something behind presence but source is none other\nthan manifestation\n[22/4/18, 9:25:10 PM] John Tan: What does source is none other manifestation mean to you?\n[22/4/18, 9:26:41 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Means when hearing sound, I don’t see it arising out of a nothingness\nbut sound springs from right where it is fully aliveness and full expression of life\n[22/4/18, 9:27:59 PM] John Tan: First you must differentiate between experiential insight that there is\nnothing behind and directly experiencing presence as the 6 entries and exits. From seeing through\nconventions and how the mind mistaken. How the mind mistakes and reify conventions. How the mind\nattempt to fix and fit and explain in a \"known\" pattern according to its existing paradigm. What are the\ndifference? And only when these 2 insights arise, practitioner can clearly understand and experience.\n[22/4/18, 9:34:30 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Insight that there is nothing behind is realising anatta, directly experience\npresence is all six senses is just PCE”\n“[Stages] 1-2 are non dual experience.

It should be noted that there are different phases of ‘dropping’, so just practice according to\nwhere you are.\nSix Stages of Dropping\nFirst is ‘someone’ is dropping…\nSecond is dropping appears as a mirror reflecting…\nThird is there is only endless dropping without footing and mental reasoning…\nFourth is dropping as vivid wide opening…\nFifth is vivid wide opening as everything…\nSixth is only Dharma spontaneously manifesting…\n~ John Tan, 2008\nThe last two stages of dropping require deep insights into non-dual, anatta and emptiness (see below).\n340\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nThe realization:\nThe taste of non-dual Presence, previously felt to be a formless background, is now tasted in the foreground\nas sound, colors, scents, textures and fabric of whatever manifests, through a (partial) realization of No-\nSelf and the penetration of the illusionary paradigm of subject-object/ perceiver-perceived division or\nduality. The beginning of non-dual realization, but not yet the full maturity.\nTriggered by contemplating:\nThere is thinking, no thinker\nThere is sound, no hearer\nSuffering exists, no sufferer\nDeeds there are, no doer\n“This time it was not ‘I AM’, it was not asking ‘who am I’, it was not the pure sense of “I AM”, it was ‘TONGSss….’,\nthe pure Sound…” - John Tan, 2006\n“There was no gap in between, no longer a few months gap for it to arise…\nThere never was a stage to enter, no I to cease and never had it existed\nThere is no entry and exit point…\nThere is no Sound out there or in here…\nThere is no ‘I’ apart from the arising and ceasing…\nThe manifold of Presence…\nMoment to moment Presence unfolds…” - John Tan, 2006\n“Ringing Sound\nAt the time of his enlightenment, Zen Master Huangpo said, \"When I hear the sound of the bell ringing,\nthere is no bell, and also no I, only ringing-sound.\"\n原文\n当我听到钟响的声音，\n没有钟，\n也没有我，\n只有响声。\n341\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\n出处\n黄檗希运，号称黄櫱禅师，唐代靖州鹫峰（今江西省宜丰县黄檗山）大乘佛教高僧。\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AFp5M5hw1w”- Soh posted in Ringing Sound\n“Non-dual realization on the other hand is a deep understanding that comes from seeing through the\nillusory nature of subject-object division. It is a natural non-dual state that resulted from an insight that\narises after rigorous investigation, challenge and a prolonged period of practice that is specially focused on\n‘No-Self’. Somehow focusing on “No-Self” will spark a sense of sacredness towards the transient and fleeting\nphenomena. The sense of sacredness that is once the monopoly of the Absolute is now also found in the\nRelative. The term ‘No-Self’ like Zen-Koan may appear cryptic, senseless or illogical but when realized, it is\nactually obviously clear, direct and simple.” - John Tan, 2009\n“Effectively PHASE 4 is merely the experience of non-division between subject/object. The initial insight\nglimpsed from the anatta stanza is without self, but in the later phase of my progress it appeared more like\nsubject/object as an inseparable union, rather than absolutely no-subject.” - John Tan, 2009\n[4/3/19, 5:15:18 PM] John Tan: The phases of insight of anatta, what did I say?\n[4/3/19, 5:16:39 PM] John Tan: The great death is the I AM in Zen.\n[4/3/19, 5:18:10 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Yes, the first rank of Tōzan\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html\n[4/3/19, 5:18:20 PM] John Tan: Yes. So how do you know it is not final but an initial entry into the gate?\n[4/3/19, 5:19:41 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Hmm later that taste is brought to all sense doors and wrong view of\nself/Self is seen through\n[4/3/19, 5:19:48 PM] John Tan: Yes! Because when all sense doors are shut, that taste is exactly the same as\nthat sound! That is precisely what was realized. The taste is the same as I AM. I did not seek it, it was revealed.\nThe experience:\nAt this phase, experience switches back and forth between One Mind and No Mind, due to persisting\nview/paradigm of inherent existence despite nondual realization. In fact, if you look at certain people like\nKen Wilber in his journal/book ‘One Taste’, he kept switching between Witnessing (I AM) and nondual (one\nmind to no mind) despite their insight of non-dual (Stage 4), and occasionally lose access even to that\nWitnessing (such as when drinking alcohol, thus resuming the merely normal, egoic state of consciousness).\nThis is because the very deeply rooted view of inherency as well as subject-object paradigm is still present,\ntherefore non-dual Presence cannot be effortlessly sustained. After Stage 5 is realized deeply, there will be\nno more switching, there will not be a trace of subject-object duality and agency 24/7, and no mind becomes\n342\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nconstant. Even wine does not disturb my state of no-mind the slightest, however I must say on the occasions\nI consume alcohol, it is always in low amounts, except on one occasion many years ago where I did drink\nso much as to feel unsafe to drive for a while, and even then it did not throw me out of nondual. Post anatta,\nthe baseline state of consciousness is naturally joyous, perfect and pure, unperturbed by the fluctuations\nof moodiness/happiness and thus no ‘bad mood’ requiring a mood lift from a drug like alcohol, nor do I feel\nlike I need other kinds of drugs, such as psychedelic drugs, because my state of consciousness is like being\non LSD all the time while sober and without bad side effects. (And psychedelics can only at most give short\nglimpses of what becomes permanent after stable realization, see:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/02/madness-or-nirvana-psychedelics-paradox.html )\nJohn Tan wrote in 2011 shortly after my anatta realization (Stage 5):\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../realization...\n“I saw this quote in your forum thread Any living enlightened Master? I wonder why you quoted it, it doesn’t\nseem relevant. Nevertheless with the recent insight into anatta, I am sure you no more concur with Judith\nBlackstone that “Complete nondual realization is said to be extremely rare, if it is possible at all.” In fact not\nonly is complete non-dual possible, it is simply the beginning. In the realm of no-mind, all experiences are\nimplicitly non-dual and effortless. This should not be a mystery to you by now.\nThe purpose of bringing up Judith Blackstone quote is not to boast about one’s achievement but to convey\nan additional point in practice. That is in addition to experience and realization, you have to embrace the\n‘right view’. I have mentioned to you in the article Realization and Experience and Non-Dual Experience\nfrom Different Perspectives, I will re-iterate it here:\nTo mature this realization, even direct experience of the absence of an agent will prove insufficient; there\nmust also be a total new paradigm shift in terms of view; we must free ourselves from being bonded to\nthe idea, the need, the urge and the tendency of analyzing, seeing and understanding our moment to\nmoment of experiential reality from a source, an essence, a center, a location, an agent or a controller\nand rest entirely on anatta and Dependent Origination.\nTherefore despite the clear realization and right experience, seamlessness and effortlessness of non-dual\nexperience will not be smooth without ‘right view’. The reason though obvious is often overlooked; if deep\nat the back of a practitioner’s mind he still hold the dualistic and inherent view, how is it possible to have\nseamless and effortless experience of in seeing, just scenery; in hearing, just sound? How unreserved,\nopen and seamless can a practitioner be in transcending the self altogether into the transience? Hence\nequip oneself with a view that can integrate with the realization and experience, it will help practitioners\nprogress more smoothly. Understanding the impact of view in practice is what I find lacking in many of\nyour posts. You may want to look into it.\nWith regards to the attachment of view, it does not apply to practitioners that have gone pass certain\nphases of insights. Practitioners after certain phases of insights are constantly abolishing ground and are\n343\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nclear that whatever pith instructions and views are merely provisional. There are masters that caution\npractitioners and there are students that parrot their masters’ advises, so do not follow blindly. In fact if\nunderstood correctly every deepening of view is a giving up. In the case of anatta, it is the total\nelimination of Self.\n\"Bhikkkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if you covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, do you\nunderstand this Dhamma as comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up [i.e. crossing over]\nand not for the purpose of grasping?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Bhikkhus, as purified and bright as this view is,\nif you do not covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, would you then know this Dhamma as\ncomparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up [i.e. crossing over] and not for the purpose of\ngrasping?\" \"Yes, venerable sir.\"\nsource: http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm”\nJudith Blackstone is still at one mind phase (Stage 4) so she cannot fathom at her level of insight how is total\nand constant nondual possible effortlessly. Her view of inherency is still obscuring. Same for Ken Wilber.\nAlthough I enjoyed reading the books of both authors very much.\nAs for John Tan, he wrote that after his realisation of anatta in around 1997, there was a period of instability\nand going back and forth between one mind and no mind before all traces of subject/object and agency\ndissolves and the state of no mind becomes the default natural state. Since then, he no longer experiences\neven a trace of subject/object duality or sense of agent/agency. Before the realisation of anatta, he had\nexperiences and glimpses of one mind but without the realisation there is no breakthrough.\nOne Mind\nA changeless open and limitless space of awareness that is indistinguishable/inseparable from, but not\nidentical to, the changing contents of consciousness that it contains.\n\"(One Mind) Means consciousness is of true existence like a container. Consciousness is not in the body,\nbut the body is in consciousness. Sound arises in consciousness. Therefore consciousness doesn't change.\"\n- John Tan, 2013\n“15/4/13 12:37:11 AM: John Tan: One mind is you are always looking at an ultimate mind behind, you are\nnot looking at manifestation\n15/4/13 12:37:26 AM: Soh Wei Yu: But it's not I Am right\n15/4/13 12:37:36 AM: John Tan: Yes it is not\n15/4/13 12:38:18 AM: Soh Wei Yu: It's like integrating foreground as being an aspect of background\n15/4/13 12:38:28 AM: John Tan: Everything is consumed into the source (for One Mind)\n15/4/13 12:39:24 AM: John Tan: I am is just the pure background behind but external objects are not\nsubsumed into it… like separate\n15/4/13 12:39:48 AM: John Tan: I am I ....dualistic\n15/4/13 12:41:53 AM: John Tan: In this case (One Mind) all is being consumed/subsumed into the source\n344\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\n15/4/13 12:42:45 AM: John Tan: Sound is consciousness is not one mind but no mind”\n“14/5/13 9:39:15 PM: John Tan: One mind is different.

For example I had glimpses of no mind even before stage 1.. also after\nstage 4 one is cycling between one mind and no mind until stage 5 clears that tendency as insight is very\nclear on anatta as always so.\nNo mind is like PCE. No self/Self just luminous manifestation. But as a state of experience, not necessarily\nrealization of anatta as always so.

There is an Awareness reflecting thoughts and manifestation. (\"I AM\") - John Tan Stage 1 and 2\nMirror bright is experienced but distorted. Dualistic and Inherent seeing.\n2. Thoughts and manifestation are required for the mirror to see itself. - John Tan Stage 4\nNon-Dualistic but Inherent seeing. Beginning of non-dual insight.\n3. Thoughts and manifestation have always been the mirror (The mirror here is seen as a whole) - John\nTan Stage 5\nNon-Dualistic and non-inherent insight.\n349\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nIn 3 not even a quantum line can be drawn from whatever arises; whatever that appears to come and\ngoes is the Awareness itself. There is no Awareness other than that. We should use the teachings of\nAnatta (no-self), DO (dependent origination) and Emptiness to see the 'forms' of awareness.\nHow to Progress from Stage 4 into Stage 5\nInvestigate and challenge all sense of awareness being unchanging and independent. Contemplate on\nBahiya Sutta and the Wind/Blowing analogy (see John Tan Stage 5). In John Tan Stage 4, Awareness is still\nunderstood to be a one-way dependency: transient forms are none other than (expressions of)\nchangeless awareness but changeless awareness is not equivalent to transient forms. Contemplating on\nthe two-way dependency can also be helpful if you like analytical approach: Greg Goode on\nAdvaita/Madhyamika\nBut first of all, you need to understand the difference between Stage 4 and Stage 5 clearly. Here are some\npointers:\nIn early 2010, before I realised anatta:\n“(11:12 PM) Thusness: you are using stage 4 understanding to explain 6. I am not interested in views, only\nthe insight that allows you to understand the right view. that is in phase 4, 'non-dual' is the insight. In\nphase 5, that observer is gone, there is not only no 'in' here or out 'there' not because it is non-dual, but\nbecause there is no such observer at all. Anatta. that is the 'insight' that must arise. just like what dharma\ndan said, you do not deny subjective or objective reality, they are only provisional and conventional. but\nwhen the dualistic and inherent hears the term 'non-dual', they either visualize the 2 becoming one or\n'you have become me'... because this is how a mind that is trapped would think despite the experience.\nfor what that is beyond the four extremes cannot be expressed adequately using language, so what is\nimportant is the insights and see how one expresses these insights. like joan tollifson, it is the direct\nexperience, there is no view about it\n(11:30 PM) Thusness: means a practitioner will only experience hardness, softness, intentions, scenery,\nsound, no self, action directly. but conventionally, you are still you, I am still me. there is no such thing as\nyou are me, get it? or there is an awareness that is sound, or all is just this awareness. there is no such\nconcept. there is sound, sight, thoughts, and what you call awareness are just that\n(11:34 PM) AEN: icic.. ya I talked about it in\nhttp://www.thetaobums.com/index.php?showtopic=13153&amp;st=120#\n(11:35 PM) Thusness: yeah but your mind is thinking some awareness, or all are just this awareness. this\nis a dualistic way of understanding. though experience is non-dual, that is phase 4. that is treating winter\nas spring and spring as autumn. that is treating fire as becoming ashes. get it? although you said that\nsound is awareness, you are still treating it as that. as if winter becomes spring, or winter is spring. get it?\nit is different\n350\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nfor example dharma dan said there is just sensations, thoughts...the aggregates. whether super\nawareness or awareness. it is different from saying sensation is awareness, thoughts is awareness as if\nawareness has become thoughts”\nCommentary by Soh, 2021: “At phase 4 one may be trapped in the view that everything is one awareness\nmodulating as various forms, like gold being shaped into various ornaments while never leaving its pure\nsubstance of gold. This is the Brahman view. Although such a view and insight is non-dual, it is still based\non a paradigm of essence-view and ‘inherent existence’. Instead, one should realise the emptiness of\nawareness [being merely a name just like ‘weather’ – see chapter on the weather analogy], and should\nunderstand consciousness in terms of dependent origination. This clarity of insight will get rid of the\nessence view that consciousness is an intrinsic essence that modulates into this and that. As the book\n‘What the Buddha Taught’ by Walpola Rahula quoted two great Buddhist scriptural teachings on this\nmatter:\nIt must be repeated here that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no permanent, unchanging spirit which\ncan be considered 'Self', or 'Soul\", or 'Ego', as opposed to matter, and that consciousness (vinnana) should not\nbe taken as 'spirit' in opposition to matter. This point has to be particularly emphasized, because a wrong\nnotion that consciousness is a sort of Self or Soul that continues as a permanent substance through life, has\npersisted from the earliest time to the present day.\nOne of the Buddha's own disciples, Sati by name, held that the Master taught: 'It is the same consciousness that\ntransmigrates and wanders about.' The Buddha asked him what he meant by 'consciousness'. Sati's reply is\nclassical: 'It is that which expresses, which feels, which experiences the results of good and bad deeds here and\nthere'.\n'To whomever, you stupid one', remonstrated the Master, 'have you heard me expounding the doctrine in this\nmanner? Haven't I in many ways explained consciousness as arising out of conditions: that there is no arising of\nconsciousness without conditions.' Then the Buddha went on to explain consciousness in detail: \"Conciousness\nis named according to whatever condition through which it arises: on account of the eye and visible forms arises\na consciousness, and it is called visual consciousness; on account of the ear and sounds arises a consciousness,\nand it is called auditory consciousness; on account of the nose and odours arises a consciousness, and it is\ncalled olfactory consciousness; on account of the tongue and tastes arises a consciousness, and it is called\ngustatory consciousness; on account of the body and tangible objects arises a consciousness, and it is called\ntactile consciousness; on account of the mind and mind-objects (ideas and thoughts) arises a consciousness,\nand it is called mental consciousness.'\nThen the Buddha explained it further by an illustration: A fire is named according to the material on account of\nwhich it burns. A fire may burn on account of wood, and it is called woodfire. It may bum on account of straw,\nand then it is called strawfire. So consciousness is named according to the condition through which it arises.\nDwelling on this point, Buddhaghosa, the great commentator, explains: '. . . a fire that burns on account of\nwood burns only when there is a supply, but dies down in that very place when it (the supply) is no longer there,\nbecause then the condition has changed, but (the fire) does not cross over to splinters, etc., and become a\nsplinter-fire and so on; even so the consciousness that arises on account of the eye and visible forms arises in\nthat gate of sense organ (i.e., in the eye), only when there is the condition of the eye, visible forms, light and\n351\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nattention, but ceases then and there when it (the condition) is no more there, because then the condition has\nchanged, but (the consciousness) does not cross over to the ear, etc., and become auditory consciousness and\nso on . . .'\nThe Buddha declared in unequivocal terms that consciousness depends on matter, sensation, perception and\nmental formations, and that it cannot exist independently of them. He says:\n'Consciousness may exist having matter as its means (rupupayam) matter as its object (rupdrammanam)\nmatter as its support (rupapatittham) and seeking delight it may grow, increase and develop; or consciousness\nmay exist having sensation as its means ... or perception as its means ... or mental formations as its means,\nmental formations as its object, mental formations as its support, and seeking delight it may grow, increase and\ndevelop.\n'Were a man to say: I shall show the coming, the going, the passing away, the arising, the growth, the increase or\nthe development of consciousness apart from matter, sensation, perception and mental formations, he would\nbe speaking of something that does not exist.'“\nBodhidharma likewise taught: Seeing with insight, form is not simply form, because form depends on mind.\nAnd, mind is not simply mind, because mind depends on form. Mind and form create and negate each other. …\nMind and the world are opposites, appearances arise where they meet. When your mind does not stir inside, the\nworld does not arise outside. When the world and the mind are both transparent, this is the true insight.” (from\nthe Wakeup Discourse) Awakening to Reality: Way of Bodhi\n\"Jayson MPaul\nSangye Gyatso none of these things are about nihilism, although that is a real danger for those who\nmisunderstand emptiness. No Mind is what is always already true. It has no existence of its own. No mind\napart from phenomena, no phenomena apart from mind. This is what Soh Wei Yu meant when he said\nthere is no true existence of mind.\"\n“[12:27 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: As for the deconstruction process via total exertion, a more effective\nway will be contemplating the ayatanas (Soh: See https://suttacentral.net/mn148/en/bodhi) and\nconsciousness sort of deconstruction..\nAs I told you the insight trigger from \"hearer hearing sound\" and \"ear, sound, ear-consciousness\" are\ndifferent.

So sound is the actual(ity that) consciousness is referring to. There is no\nconsciousness other than that\nWhen they see through reification, then phenomena has a different meaning. Seeing everything as\nawareness is not one mind. Seeing everything as the same unchanging mind is the problem. When you\nsee through reification, you realized \"awareness\" is just a label point to these manifestations. So there is\nnothing wrong saying that.

Unfortunately he cannot clearly discern the grayscale of no-self”\n“Sep\n10\nRigpa and Aggregates\n(Also see: Dzogchen, Rigpa and Dependent Origination)\nFrom Dharma Overground, Dharma Dan (Daniel M. Ingram):\nDear Mark,\nThanks for your descriptions and analysis. They are interesting and relevant.\nI think of it this way, from a very high but still vipassana point of view, as you are framing this question in\na vipassana context:\nFirst, the breath is nice, but at that level of manifesting sensations, some other points of view are helpful:\nAssume something really simple about sensations and awareness: they are exactly the same. In fact,\nmake it more simple: there are sensations, and this includes all sensations that make up space, thought,\nimage, body, anything you can imagine being mind, and all qualities that are experienced, meaning the\nsum total of the world.\nIn this very simple framework, rigpa is all sensations, but there can be this subtle attachment and lack of\ninvestigation when high terms are used that we want there to be this super-rigpa, this awareness that is\nother. You mention that you feel there is a larger awareness, an awareness that is not just there the limits\nof your senses. I would claim otherwise: that the whole sensate universe by definition can't arise without\nthe quality of awareness by definition, and so some very subtle sensations are tricking you into thinking\nthey are bigger than the rest of the sensate field and are actually the awareness that is aware of other\nsensations.\nAwareness is simply manifestation. All sensations are simply present.\nThus, be wary of anything that wants to be a super-awareness, a rigpa that is larger than everything else,\nas it can't be, by definition. Investigate at the level of bare sensate experience just what arises and see\nthat it can't possibly be different from awareness, as this is actually an extraneous concept and there are\nactually just sensations as the first and final basis of reality.\nAs you like the Tibetan stuff, and to quote Padmasambhava in the root text of the book The Light of\nWisdom:\n354\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\n\"The mind that observes is also devoid of an ego or self-entity.\nIt is neither seen as something different from the aggregates\nNor as identical with these five aggregates.\nIf the first were true, there would exist some other substance.\nThis is not the case, so were the second true,\nThat would contradict a permanent self, since the aggregates are impermanent.\nTherefore, based on the five aggregates,\nThe self is a mere imputation based on the power of the ego-clinging.\nAs to that which imputes, the past thought has vanished and is nonexistent.\nThe future thought has not occurred, and the present thought does not withstand scrutiny.\"\nI really found this little block of tight philosophy helpful. It is also very vipassana at its core, but it is no\nsurprise the wisdom traditions converge.\nThus, if you want to crack the nut, notice that everything is 5 aggregates, including everything you think is\nsuper-awareness, and be less concerned with what every little type of consciousness is than with just\nperceiving them directly and noticing the gaps that section off this from that, such as rigpa from thought\nstream, or awareness from sensations, as these are golden chains.\nMore: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/09/rigpa-and-aggregates.html“\n“ Karatzo wrote: ↑Sun Oct 18, 2020 9:00 pm\nConsciousness is compound and thus not self, so it is not this that transmigrates. So what is it? And\nwhat is Rigpa? Rigpa is not a part of the 5 aggregates. But the buddha declared that a being consists of\nthe 5 aggregates and nothing more. That there is no-self in absolute reality...then how transmigration\nworks?\nDzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith replied:\nOne, whoever told you rig pa is not part of the five aggregates? Rig pa is knowledge of your own state. In\nits impure form one's own state manifests as the five aggregates; in its pure form, it manifests as the five\nbuddha families.\nNagārjuna resolves this issue through using the eight examples. There is no substantial transmission, but\nthere is serial continuity, like lighting a fire from another fire, impressing a seal on a document and so on.\nSee his verses on dependent origination:\n355\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nAll migrating beings are causes and results.\nbut here there are no sentient beings at all;\njust empty phenomena entirely produced\nfrom phenomena that are only empty,\nphenomena without a self and what belongs to a self,\n[like] utterances, lamps, mirrors, seals,\nlenses, seeds, sourness and echoes.\nAlthough the aggregates are serially connected,\nthe wise are understand that nothing transfers.\nAlso, the one who imputes annihilation\nupon extremely subtle existents,\nis not wise,\nand will not see the meaning of ‘arising from conditions’.”\n“Now we must understand not to confuse the dynamism of vivid appearances as the substrate itself and\nmust avoid from taking it to be therefore this imputed substrate must too be exhausted to free oneself\nfrom extremes.\nOnce this view is clear, the implications of mental constructs and conventions on how they confuse the\nmind will be understood clearly. What left is simply natural spontaneity of vivid appearance in\nobviousness.” – John Tan, 2020\nReply to Yacine\nThusness's (John Tan’s) reply to Yacine's post in Dharma Connection\nHi Yacine,\nBoth the talks and link you provided are pointing to a special kind of consciousness that I am familiar and\nwas once very attached to (more than 3 decades ago). The experience is precious but still fabricated One\ncan trigger similar experience/phenomena through self-enquiry or koan which in my opinions are much\nmore direct and effective.\nTherefore I do not think Buddha is teaching that; contrary he taught the path to end that by realizing\nanatta, dependent origination and Emptiness.\nSounds pretty cool John.I think where the confusion pops from is that some approaches talk about the citta\nas a special kind of consciousness, ie a consciounesses not glued to any of the other khandas, a\nconsciounesses released (the citta as Ajahn Maha Boowa calls it)\n356\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nPls see https://www.dhammatalks.net/.../Maha_Boowa_The_Path_to... The non-dual teaching (say Rupert\nSpira talking about the fabrications of time in his classic video:https://youtu.be/PNdjzm8dKOc) would then\nbe a pointer a skilful means but still with a slight subtle reification left (Greg Goode mentions the complete\ndissolution of awareness once memory is seen as no referential) ? I am mentioning that because Rodney\nSmith proposes such a nice pointer on his talk on mental fabrication in the DO series above.\nie this image of the dead center from which past and future (and stories) emerge as mental fabrications. In\nhis book he talks about the vertical axis of timeless awareness (the unconditioned) and the horizontal axis\nof conceptual time and stories.And how with thoughts we invest the \"Buddha inside\" into (apparently)\nbuying into the conceptions of the horizontal axis stretching self, object and time (as Rob Burbea would put\nit) out of the pure awareness, out of the Deathless.\nThat's a nice pointer I found but there is this reification of the dead center in it that might need complete\ndeconstruction (thanks to emptiness). What's your take on that? (Sorry, too many questions at once lol)\nLet’s take the below example:\n“With the arising insight of anatta, self is seen through. A new mode of perception arises. A mode of\nperception that pierces through reification.”\nDoes this sound like the practitioner has now acquired “a new mode of perception” as if a third eye\nsuddenly appears in between the eyebrows?\nIn truth nothing new has arisen; contrary it is a process of elimination.\nWhat eliminated is the habitual tendency to “reify”.\nNow using the same analogy, let’s look at “non-dual”?\nIt will be helpful to understand the 2 major causes that gave rise to such phenomena like awareness as an\nobserver and non-dual awareness. They are:\n1. one's ability to suspense \"conceptualization\".\n2. habitual tendencies to \"reify\" and \"dualify\"\nWithout conceptualization experience becomes direct, clean, clear, vivid, crystal, brilliance and\ntransparent.\n357\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nWithout the layer of conceptualization, there is no layer that separates observer from the observed. If\nthere is no insight that all along the subject-object division is assumed, then “non-dual” becomes a state\nand there is oscillation between duality and non-duality. If there is realization of the emptiness of the\n“division”, then experiences turns effortlessly non-dual.\nHow does “non-dual awareness” arise?\nIt is the continuation of the habitual tendency to reify that objectifies the \"clean, clear, vivid, crystal,\nbrilliance and transparent\" state of experience that is free from duality into non-dual awareness. This\nalso means that latent tendencies lie far deeper than surface conceptualization, mere cessation of\nconceptual thoughts is unable to overcome these tendencies.\nHow is it to see \"the world\" from an arahant point of view? Without fabrication or rather with fabrication\nseen as fabrication and therefore divested from investment.Also some teaching say that freed\nconsciousness is awareness and awareness bathes in the unconditioned, the Deathless (very similar to non-\ndual teaching ie what you're looking for your looking from it).\nWould the unreified Deathless simply be seeing interdependence of all fabrication as emptiness itself ? (And\nof course the consciousness that cognizes emptiness has to be empty itself, dependent on seeing\nemptiness to co-arise) How do you see the Deathless fitting into this John?\nIs untainted consciousness = non-dual awareness?\nThis brings out another point. That is severing the habit of abstraction and generalization also\nimplies ceasing the reified abstraction from flowing moment to moment. For this is the cause of\nattachment. If there is no \"abstraction\" that flows, there is no base for grasping and the rational of why\nthere is no permanent soul that is reincarnated from life to life in Buddhism becomes clear. Which is also\nwhy Buddha taught there is no self, only the 5 aggregates and no pure consciousness, only the 6 classes\nof consciousness that dependently originates with conditions (internal and external bases).\nSaying untainted consciousness is non-dual awareness is no different from saying:\nsound-consciousness is the same as eye-consciousness\nor\nmind-consciousness is same as body-consciousness.\nWhen we conceptualize and abstract, it appears there is as if a pure consciousness that transcends\nconditions and it is the same consciousness throughout we are talking about in differing\nsituations. However for one that is free from abstraction and reification, the actual experience is\ncompletely different. For them,\n358\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nIn hearing, whole body-mind-environment is that sound and what we termed as “sound-consciousness” is\nthat “sound”.\nIn seeing, whole body-mind-environment is that scenery and what we termed as “eye-consciousness” is\nthat lurid and vivid scenery.\nAt this point, it is crucial to emphasize that when the trace of a background mirror vanishes without\nremainder, knowingness/presence is “form”. Touch anything, feel anything, smell anything. Vividness\nthroughout, aliveness everywhere! Poetically practitioners is eating “knowingness”, touching\n“knowingness” and tasting “knowingness” in real-time. Zero effort, fully spontaneous!\n‘Mind as mountains, rivers, and the earth is nothing other than mountains, rivers, and the earth. There\nare no additional waves or surf, no wind or smoke. Mind as the sun, the moon, and the stars is nothing\nother than the sun, the moon, and the stars.’\nShobogenzo, Soku-shin-ze-butsu\nFor non-dualists, it is always tempting to say non-dual awareness [is] appearing as sound and scenery but\nsound is of course not and nothing like scenery. We also can't say sound has changed to\nscenery. Therefore dualistic consciousness cannot be said to be non-dual awareness yet neither are they\ndifferent!\nThe language of forms and abstraction become clumsy and very often misleading when we deal with the\nnature of direct experience. Fortunately Buddhism has quite creatively devised a tool that helps us see\nthrough conventions, dissolve reification and still not miss out the importance of conditionality (another\nbig topic). As such it is advisable to sever this habit of abstraction by familiarizing oneself with dependent\narising and emptiness when dealing with everyday conventions.\nAs a side note, in addition to the path of renunciation (dispassion/disenchantment), you may want to look\nat “grasping” from “energy being tied up in withholding mental constructs”. Many seem unable to have an\nactual taste of the relationship between “grasping” and “reifying”, if this isn’t clear then the whole practice\nof anatta and emptiness (Buddhism) will not be very fruitful imo.\nFrom this prespective, grasping is not holding on to reification, it is that reification!\nThis becomes very clear with the experiential insight of anatta. When self is negated, the first obvious\nexperience is “lightness” as if weight suddenly becomes a non-existence. There is tremendous release\nand clarity. If we negate the body-construct, for example, \"there is no body, only sensations\", the\ndeconstruction of the image of a concrete body similarly led to a tremendous release. Every\n359\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\ndeconstruction is a release (of energy) and experience turns more and more clean, pure, vivid, radiance\nand free.\nHow is it to see \"the world\" from an arahant point of view?\nFrom the example above, one may be able to extrapolate the experience. For one that has severed self,\nexperience is free, clean, radiance and non-dual. Seen is just seen. Heard is just heard. Radiance all\naround and free!\nAs for \"the deathless\", I believe Soh has posted you a past discussion on the topic\n(see http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2018/01/the-deathless-in-buddhadharma.html). I couldn't\nhave put it better.\nLastly Yacine, for\nRodney Smith’s talk on mental fabrication in the DO series,\nImo, the \"NOW\" radiating out is no different from \"Self\", deconstruct it.\nThere is no \"here\", just impression of \"here\" formed by sensations and thoughts.\nNo \"now\", just impression of the mere presence from appearances of thoughts, sound, shapes, colors,\nlight.\nThe tendency to reify is amazing, we let go of 'selfness' yet unknowingly grasped ‘nowness’ and ‘hereness’.\nAll these are merely empty reifications, appear concrete but when directly tasted, are empty like\nevanescence mist.\nHope that helps!\nGoing to sleep, pen off.\nLabels: John Tan |\nWhen Soh was at Stage 4, John Tan wrote:\n“o 12 Sep `10, 12:44PM\n360\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nHi Simpo and AEN,\nYet we cannot get carried away by all these blissful experiences. Blissfulness is the result of luminosity\nwhereas liberation is due to prajna wisdom.\nTo AEN,\nFor intense luminosity in the foreground, you will not only have vivid experience of ‘brilliant aliveness’,\n‘you’ must also completely disappear. It is an experience of being totally ‘transparent’ and without\nboundaries. These experiences are quite obvious, you will not miss it. However the body-mind will not\nrest in great content due to an experience of intense luminosity. Contrary it can make a practitioner more\nattached to a non-dual ultimate luminous state.\nFor the mind to rest, it must have an experience of ‘great dissolve’ that whatever arises perpetually self\nliberates. It is not about phenomena dissolving into some great void but it is the empty nature of\nwhatever arises that self-liberates. It is the direct experience of groundlessness and non –abiding due to\ndirect insight of the empty nature of phenomena and that includes the non-dual luminous essence.\nTherefore In addition to bringing this ‘taste’ to the foreground, you must also ‘realize’ the difference\nbetween wrong and right view. There is also a difference in saying “Different forms of Aliveness” and\n“There is just breath, sound, scenery...magical display that is utterly unfindable, ungraspable and without\nessence- empty.”\nIn the former case, realize how the mind is manifesting a subtle tendency of attempting to ‘pin’ and locate\nsomething that inherently exists. The mind feels uneasy and needs to seek for something due to its\nexisting paradigm. It is not simply a matter of expression for communication sake but a habit that runs\ndeep because it lacks a ‘view’ that is able to cater for reality that is dynamic, ungraspable, non-local ,\ncenter-less and interdependent.\nAfter direct realization of the non-dual essence and empty nature, the mind can then have a direct\nglimpse of what is meant by being ‘natural’, otherwise there will always be a ‘sense of contrivance’.\nMy 2 cents and have fun with your army life.\nEdited by Thusness 12 Sep `10, 12:56PM”\nSuggestions for Anatta Contemplation\nMr. A.

Reflections depend on and is not other than mirror, but mirror is not reflections.\nThere was a young kid who realized I AM and One Mind at the age of 17. I was just reminded of him.\nHe wrote: \"Some people may perceive all of this as something deeply mysterious beyond the scope of their\nown capacities. It is not. It is simple and plain living, and nothing mysterious about it. Do not imagine that\nthis unconditioned awareness is somehow apart from the world and daily life. On the contrary, it could be\nsaid that one is even more closer to life than ever before, because there is no separation between you and\nthe world. When caught up in dualism, one creates the illusion of someone being aware (subject) and\nsomething to be aware of (object). Yet there is just this awareness, there is nothing to be aware of.\nConditioned phenomena are not apart from awareness in any way, yet they not really awareness either.\nPerhaps the best way to describe this is to use the analogy of a mirror, the unconditioned awareness being\nthe mirror and conditioned phenomena beings images reflected in the mirror. The mirror doesn't change\nbecause reflections arise. It does not dwell upon the reflections, yet the reflections exists nowhere apart\nfrom the mirror. They are the mirror, yet the mirror isn't the reflections.\"\n- http://the-wanderling.com/cyber-sangha.html\nThis is a perfect description of John Tan/Thusness Stage 4.\nAnother similar analogy in One Mind is sky and clouds. Inseparable yet not the same. (And yet, this analogy\nmight be used even at I AM phase - the sky being taken to be the formless dissociated background).”\nOne Mind and No Mind is in Stage 4, however, one can also access One Mind and No Mind in Stage 0 as a\npeak experience (i.e. no permanent realizations). No mind is similar to PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience\n- see Glossary).\nSam wrote:\nOct 24, 2018, 10:45:00 AM\nI think I am clear on difference between no mind and one mind. But I am still not clear about how no mind\nis different from Anatta. Does not Anatta already imply no mind and vice versa?\nSoh replied:\nOct 24, 2018, 7:02:00 PM\n364\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nIn no-mind, the sense of a background Self, awareness, seer, hearer, is gone and instead the awareness is\njust the sound, the sight, the everything.\nBut it can just be a peak experience. Means, the sense of Self/background can be dissolved momentarily\nand returns later on. Having an experience where sense of self and background dissolves temporarily is\nnot the same as having an insight that there never actually was an Agent/Background.\nAnatta is a dharma seal, a 'truth' of what is always already the case. No-mind becomes effortless after\nanatta realization.\nFor Anatta realization, it is suddenly realized that in seeing there's always only the seen with no seer, in\nhearing there's always only the heard with no hearer, and same for all other senses. Until it is suddenly\nrealized that the whole structure of Seer-Seeing-Seen doesn't apply and there is no seeing besides colors -\n- no seer, no hearing besides sound -- no hearer, no awareness besides manifestation. This is not just\nrealising the lack of borders or duality but realizing the Absence of an inherently existing\nSelf/Agent/Awareness behind manifestation. It's seeing that the 'Background' never existed. This is the\nrealization of anatta.\nAs I told Mr. J many years ago, “anatta is not just about nondual. but experience is implicitly nondual when\nanatta is seen. Anatta is a realization that there never was a seer or a seeing apart from seen, the\nmanifestation. That is to say, one can have vivid nondual experience but there might not be clarity of insight.\nwhat is crucial or the key to effortless, natural and liberating experience is insight/realization - insight into\nthe relationship of awareness and transience, until one realizes impermanence is buddha-nature.”\nThe 90 Days Cycle\nJohn Tan often cautioned about the 90 day cycle to those who just had a breakthrough awakening into no-\nself. This refers to the intense non-dual luminous clarity and bliss that occurs for a period of 90 days after\nthe initial breakthrough of some insights into no-self (could be phase 4 or phase 5 insight), only for it to\nbecome dull as karmic (deep conditioning) propensities return. Only after some periods of practice and\ndeepening of insights does the experience become stabilized. The purpose of cautioning is so that one does\nnot prematurely think that the experience has stabilized, and one should not be disheartened when some\ndullness or karmic propensities creep back. Simply continue practicing diligently and mature one’s insights\neven further.\n“Thusness: Ok. Non-duality is a very very unique experience. One of the most unique experience I have\never had.\nParticipant 1: I think there are different levels of it right?\n365\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nThusness: Uh, there are different levels of it. The finer of experience and the not so fine, the initial level of\nexperience. In the finest level of experience you will attain a sense of total transparency. It means when\nyou were to touch the sand, you feel the sand, you feel everything. You ask, which aspect is not the Mind?\nYou cannot answer. There is no in-between. There is just that.\nParticipant 1: How about the initial aspect?\nThusness: The initial aspect is this. The initial aspect is that there is a sudden realisation of non-duality.\nThen you will be in a stage of probably 60 to 90 days of bliss, of joy, or rapture. These things will happen\nfirst. Then, you will suddenly feel {inaudible} the momentum is coming to work. Now, this sudden\n{inaudible} of non-duality or the experience of non-duality will come again probably in {inaudible} even\nwith practise. Because it will not just stop, but it will not just continuously surface. I mean it will continue\nto surface, but it will take place with the momentum, that you feel a bit confused. Can you get what I\nmean? But, if after certain time about two, three years of continuous practise and continuous\nexperiencing it becomes stabilised. Then it becomes very clear. Then the experience of transparency will\n{inaudible}. And when you experience, a person will feel radiance bright. Means when you see him, you\nwill find radiance bright, you know?\nParticipant 1: You mean this person see other person, radiance bright?\nThusness: Because once a person experience non-duality, there is no holding, there is just luminosity.\nThere is just a pure sense of existence, of clarity, of all things. Somehow, there is an utmost joy and\nenergy that flows from everywhere, that sustains a person. This is its nature.”\n- John Tan, 2007, Transcript of Lankavatara Sutra with Thusness 2007\nTo understand what it means by a person looking radiant bright (this is true and observable, people have\nseen my changes in facial expressions and my aunt noted the radiance in John Tan’s face), just look at how\nthe facial expressions of Frank Yang evolved over time into the realization of anatta:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t8KvdMtT4A\n“Most intense is anatta, explosion of luminous intensity into 3 states (waking, dreaming, deep sleep) into\nmeditative experiences into 3 states and several episodes of dreams of clarity … but even then never went\nbeyond 90 days cycle… that’s why I tell you always wait for 90 days cycle.” - John Tan\n“In the 90-days cycle, different experiences can manifest depending on the depth of intensities. It is also\nbest and easiest to witness all sort of phenomena in the first 90 days cycle commonly described as\nintense meditative experiences. This is due to the powerful momentum from the breakthrough of insight\nat that moment. If he has strong base of meditation previously, the effect is sort of “multiplied”.\n366\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nThe first factor is the “willingness” to let go. Surrendering is thorough. The release is thorough.\nTherefore second factor is energy release. There is tremendous energy that is previously held up and\ntied up in preserving the “I” is now released. The mind and body constructs dropped and practitioner\nfeels “light”. Fearlessness is third factor. The intensity of clarity due to directness of perception is fourth\nfactor.\nAll these factors serve as the conditions that intensifies the 6 entries and exits.\nWhether energy turn oceanic-wave like pattern or sensations turns crystal and transparent is experienced\nor surrendering leading to mind state ceased, they are all A&P.\nTest is whether the factors can penetrate into the 3 states and whether unconscious dreams manifest\nkarmic tendencies or dreams of clarity or dreamless clarity.\nAlso diet is an important factor that is often overlooked. Anyway we are not teachers, so don’t anyhow\nadvice and mislead.” - John Tan, 2017\nMr. K wrote in 2012,\n“I wanted to ask you, my most shocking and powerful\n> experience so far was anatta in the theme of that first stanza thusness wrote:\n> There is thinking, no thinker, There is hearing, no hearer, There is seeing,\n> no seer.

This is because practitioners tend to focus on the experience rather than view after initial\nrealization. Although he realizes the truth of anatta, the 'dualistic and inherent view' runs far deeper than\nwhat we think. But he will wake up one day and everything turns effortless and natural and it should be\nclose. The part on the total exertion is still however lacking, there is still inner holding and lingering trace\nof \"One Mind\". :-)”\n“Mindrolling Jetsun Khandro Rinpoche on Uprooting the Cancer of Ignorance\n>As human beings, we struggle with basic ignorance. If you look at it from the cittamatrin perspective, the\nimprints of our basic ignorance are stored in the eighth consciousness, the alayavijnana. If you look at it\nfrom the madhyamika perspective, the causal consciousness is where our storehouse of basic ignorance\nremains steadfast. Whether at the level of alayavijnana or causal consciousness, as long as the imprint of\nsamsara remains at the core of our mind, severing the ties and influence of duality will be very difficult.\n>Even having glimpsed the indivisible nature of appearance-emptiness, if the seed of karmic imprint is\nstill held at the level of basic consciousness, there is always room for doubt. There is always room for the\ncausal consciousness to deviate from the basic fundamental nature. With continual separation between\n368\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nthe fundamental nature and basic ignorance, wisdom and ignorance become two different things—and\nso wisdom decreases, while ignorance continues to manifest. Therefore ignorance must be uprooted.\n>To uproot the cancer of ignorance, so to speak, from where it keeps coming back, you must not only\nhave a glimpse of understanding of the indivisible-ness of appearance and emptiness; that view must be\none-hundred percent strong. To take out all the poison, the severing of basic ignorance must be done\nthoroughly. Like performing surgery: to completely remove the cause of the disease, you must treat it like\nthat.\n>*— Mindrolling Jetsun Khandro Rinpoche*”\n“(11:43 AM) Thusness: i read a post saying that after sometime, enlightenment becomes dull. and\nthis is true until a form is emptiness is clearly experienced. forgotten. it becomes dull because isness, the\nclarity and intensity of no-self, non-dual oneness cannot be experienced. if there is clarity, spontaneity\nand aliveness, how can there be dullness. bear this in mind and relate it to the seven factors of\nenlightenment.” – John Tan, 2007\nIn addition to deepening one's insights, which is very important, all seven factors of enlightenment must\nbe present with non-dual insight so that one can overcome our karmic (deep conditioning) momentum.\nSo we should continue practicing diligently.\nWas reminded of some conversations in 2007:\n(10:48 PM) Thusness: now...not to underestimate all words we use. when we say 'sound', 'taste'...\nimmediately these words and symbols carry meanings. they chain and link. they have imprints, therefore\ninsight meditation is taught. many underestimated the power of these 'bonds', prevent one from seeing...\nthere is no true seeing... what are sensations? it is a word that carries certain meaning. when we say\n'taste' is a form of sensation... immediately we are bonded though we think we know what we are talking\nabout. we only think... we do not know... we do not know a lot of things.\nwhen we practice, we are not practicing to attain the ultimate. there is nothing to attain. we only attempt\nto create conditions to experience certain aspect of our pristine awareness. when we put attention into\nmindfulness, into 'bare' attention. 'seeing' bare, we actually give up other aspect of our pristine\nawareness. that is the effortless spontaneity. so when someone teach mindfulness, he said put in effort\nto be bare in attention....he is not wrong. when some one said no no no, gentle effort in being\nmindfulness and be bare in attention, he is also not wrong. for all these paths are truly pathless. one that\nthink he knows what is pathless doesn't really know. he thinks effortless is doing nothing, laze around,\nand when he act, he thought that is effort. it is a misunderstanding of a dualistic mind.\nthis is another tricky part of awareness. its all pervadingness. say that after you understand the 'Self' as\neverything, why need meditation, and dogen said, must meditate, even buddha meditate, and said\nthough not necessary, still meditate. then said practice and enlightenment is one, that is pathless. neither\ndo we do away with forms nor not forms\n369\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\n...\n2007:\n(9:54 PM) Thusness: I said that not for longchen only but also for because star might mistaken she\nunderstood Isness of longchen. why not the case of 'I AMness'? it must be the 2 conditions that is very\nvery important. then the 7 factors of enlightenment will be experienced due to the clarity and\nspontaneity. Cannot settle for anything lesser than that.\n(10:00 PM) AEN: steven norquist he hasnt experienced clarity and spontaneity?\n(10:02 PM) Thusness: have but he doesn't know the factors...that is why i say retrogress a lil and improve\non the degree of clarity on manifestation.\n(10:03 PM) AEN: retrogress in what sense?\n(10:03 PM) Thusness: means retreat a bit lah, don't always go forward. look at luminosity a lil...hehehe\n(10:04 PM) AEN: oh you mean steven norquist focus too much on spontaneity and overlooked luminosity?\nluminosity will result in energy, etc?\n(10:04 PM) Thusness: nope...he over extrapolate the meaning of spontaneity. he does not see the bond.\nthat is non-dual only in perception, not in action. therefore he lacks the energy to engage in activities. I\ncall the 'I' is gone but not the 'mine'. means there is clarity that there is no agent, but is unable to\novercome the 'mine' aspect. action is still objective due to strong karmic hindrance. however this is often\nmisunderstood...and i hope longchen doesn't. same applies to dharma dan.\n(10:09 PM) AEN: icic\n(10:09 PM) AEN: *misunderstood as what\n(10:10 PM) Thusness: what i meant by doing nothing. that is why i said do not talk about self-liberation.\nyou see i talked about it or not...\n....\n(4:38 PM) Thusness: your self enquiry is because you want to experience the 'I AM'. this is because you\nwant to experience awareness. i mean the heartbeat. non dual until a certain level b4 entering pre-\nconcious level. once you wake up while still on the bed, you are immediately just the manifestation.\nabsolutely no background, right at the moment you awake. then crystal clarity of awareness as\nphenomenon.. awareness as 'forms' and 'things'. just the 'heart beats'. super duper clear, not absorption.\nit must be a form of realisation, continuously uninterrupted. at the beginning b4 this, just spontaneous\narising will be experienced. then the 2 must fused into one. complete clarity of one spontaneous\nhappening. means clarity and spontaneity might not be able to fuse yet\n(4:44 PM) AEN: so you mean you can experience spontaneity without clarity?\n(4:44 PM) Thusness: like treat everything as yuan... all is empty...just the arising of conditions, yet the\nluminosity of awareness is still not there. so there is no true understanding of it as our nature like no-self.\nso don't anyhow go say [Soh: prematurely discuss about] self-liberation, spontaneity...etc\"\n370\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nMore on the seven factors of enlightenment:\n“SN 46.14\nPTS: S v 79\nCDB ii 1580\nGilana Sutta: Ill\n(Factors of Enlightenment)\ntranslated from the Pali by\nPiyadassi Thera\n© 1999\nAlternate translation: Thanissaro\nThus have I heard:\nOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Rajagaha, in the bamboo grove, in the Squirrels' feeding\nground. At that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa who was living in the Pipphali Cave, was afflicted with a\ndisease, was suffering therefrom, and was gravely ill.\nThen the Blessed One arising from his solitude at eventide visited the Venerable Maha Kassapa and sat\ndown on a seat made ready (for him). Thus seated the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Maha\nKassapa:\n\"Well Kassapa, how is it with you? Are you bearing up, are you enduring (your suffering)? Do your pains\ndecrease or increase? Are there signs of your pains decreasing and not of increasing?\"\n\"No, Ven. Sir, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring, the pain is very great. There is a sign not of pains\ndecreasing but of their increasing.\"\n\"Kassapa, these seven factors of enlightenment are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully\ndeveloped by me. They conduce to perfect understanding, to full realization (of the four Noble Truths)\nand to Nibbana.

Most assuredly, O Welcome Being\n(Sugata), they are factors of enlightenment.\"\nThus said the Buddha, and the Venerable Maha Kassapa glad at heart approved the utterances of the\nBuddha. Thereupon the Venerable Kassapa recovered from that affliction, and that affliction, of the\nVenerable Kassapa disappeared.”\nOn a sidenote of the sutta above, it is truly possible that the seven factors of enlightenment can\nmiraculously relieve the physical discomforts of bodily pain and illness.\nAs Soh said in 2021, “What JT said about psychological suffering released with the release of self/Self and\nbreathing [in the comments section of https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-\nnon-duality-and.html] is very true, also I would add, even physical discomfort can be released in some\nways (since mind and body are inseparable).\nYesterday i felt a little uncomfortable and groggy after i woke up from nap in the evening but then with\nmindfulness i totally just zoomed into bodily sensations and no self and entered into a very embodied\nstate like as the very fabric of sensation and forms and then it seems like a subtle veil just released and it\nbecomes very clear and wonderful.. the discomfort or feelings just miraculously dissolved into simply a\nmere state of perfection. Today I felt clearer and cleaner as well.\nAs JT said, \"Yes spending some quality time like this is always important.\"”\nJohn Tan said in 2006, “<^john^> how to overcome pain, sensation is different from pain\n<^john^> in fact, your master would want to experience that pure sensation resulting for differing\ncondition. but one should not over do it. :)\n<Presence> huh? what do you mean\n<^john^> consciousness is often treated as self. do you know that?\n<Presence> ya\n<^john^> hear the sound outside, what is that?\n<Presence> consciousness?\n<^john^> yes, and it is self according to vedas. if not because of the doctrine of anatta and emptiness. one\nwill overlook our emptiness nature. so a practitioner will want to experience it\n372\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\n<Presence> want to experience wat? pain?\n<^john^> the sound, following every single detail, the minutest details. not the pain, the sensation. even\nwhen in pain. he/she has not much here. it is another dimension of consciousness. but only to a certain\ndegree. even with practice\n<Presence> oic certain degree of? details ?\n<^john^> though the sensation is different, it doesn't mean he/she will not break hor.\nno noticing details is different... that is why when one enter the realm of no-self, he automatically develop\ninsight. finding himself everywhere in everything. the color, the fabric, the texture...etc. then through the\nseed of emptiness, it realises in addition of no-self, the meaning of emptiness. this is the nature of\nconsciousness, the nature is so. then luminosity and emptiness fuses into one however the clarity will\nreach a level and then blockage. you know why?\n<Presence> karmic propensities\n<^john^> :) yes..fetters. however you can penetrate using concentration. but that is only temporary. one\nis always tempted initially to do what your teacher did. sensing, sensing and more subtle sensing. :) that is\nnot the way. to penetrate into deeper depth, we have to use another way. :) you know how painful it is for\none that suffered from slipped disc to do stretching? a person is considered to suffered from slipped disc\nif he felt the extreme pain when he raised his leg above ground about half a feet when lying flat. :) i tried\novercoming it till my jin mai changes position. :P\n<Presence> wah how you 'overcome'\n<^john^> the doctor when x-ray out also dunno how come i can do it.\n<Presence> lol then how you do it :P\n<^john^> sensing into the minutest details enable us to slowly change it. :)\n<Presence> icic.. but you said its not so good to want to keep sensing or something ?\n<^john^> that is why i tell you only the beginning stage. :) the correct environment is crucial to progress\nfurther.\n<Presence> but wait isnt sensing the details like vipassana?\n<^john^> yes\n<Presence> oic then how?\n<^john^> what is the other form of meditation?\n<Presence> shamatha [calm abiding]\n<^john^> :) we need complement.”\nHow do we develop the 7 factors of enlightenment? Through the practice of the four foundations of\nmindfulness, which the Buddha said was the only way to liberation. He also assures that practitioners\ndeveloping the four foundations of mindfulness can expect to attain the high levels of awakening such as\nnon-returner or arahantship in 7 years or as little as 7 days. So check out Satipatthana Sutta -\nhttps://plumvillage.org/sutra/discourse-on-the-four-establishments-of-mindfulness/ and also the\nAnapansati Sutta - https://plumvillage.org/sutra/discourse-on-the-full-awareness-of-breathing/\n373\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nAnapansati – Mindfulness of Breathing – is recommendable and in it the Buddha taught that it develops\nthe four foundations of mindfulness which in turn develops the seven factors of awakening.\n“John TanSunday, February 22, 2015 at 11:52am UTC+08\nThere is the active and passive mode [of no-self]. In the active mode, what is the role of attention in\nselflessness. Means don't be afraid of attention but see the role of intention in the seamless activity of\nfunctioning and in actioning. How the sense of self that causes duality between the self and action gets\ndissolved even in the simply activity of chanting or breathing exercise.”\nIt should be noted that although the karmic tendencies may return after an initial breakthrough, the\nexperience does eventually become stabilized with further practice and the deepening of insight. As John\nTan has reported, he hasn’t had the slightest trace of subject/object division or sense of agency for the past\n20+ years after awakening to anatta, and Soh likewise reports to be the same for the past 8 years.\n“When a person sees so clearly (by insight), one will surely enter a time 60-90 days, then suddenly its (duality\ncomes back?). when I first saw it, I understood very very clearly. But he (referring to Soh) is unique, his is\nafter dunnu how many months it becomes (effortless). For me, after a few years I still cannot [overcome\nthe bond]. Then one day I see someone playing basketball, I closed my eye, I hear the sound of basketball,\nthen he bounce the ball bum bum bum, then suddenly the body mind just drop. then when he bounce the\nbasketball it feels like its my heart beat. thats (?). there’s only that sound. bum bum bum. then when they\nopen the door, the whole vibration... when the mrt goes through... (sound) vrooom, only that sound. then\nI wondered, why just now I cannot enter, then suddenly I have such complete perfect experience, what is\nthe difference? Why just now can, now cannot, then now can, just now cannot? what is disturbing the clarity?\nso I go through mentally the past experience. I saw someone playing basketball, I kept seeing, then I closed\nmy eyes, only the sound, then mind body drop, then only the sound, the ball sound hitting the ground is\nlike hitting me, that feeling, thats the experience of anatta. the 'ping pong' sound is like beating you. That\ntime I suddenly entered into the experience of no mind, while anatta has a penetrating insight where the\nbond is released. (?) from just now, then suddenly the experience, the main ? what is the cause, what is the\nprimary cause, for this entire experience to arise. I kept asking. Why this happens? then I understood that\nexperience is not the same as insight. so you can have the experience, then the penetrating insight that\nsees through clearly that (?). experience is not insight. when insight comes then you will know, then it\nbecomes natural. Insight into anatta is the realization that there is no self. What that is being described like\nyou (Mr. C) said, is an experience. but once you penetrate the insight then this is the experience. going\nfurther, after you see no self, then why do you (?) understand dependent origination? how this experience\nof total exertion, (?) relates with your view. (to me) now you shld have such experiences intermittently, mini\nones. It will always come and then (?). until one day, that bond itself is totally gone. the idea that there is no\nself, the penetrating insight, it has the anatta experience does not necessarily mean that you have not (?)\nthis bond of dependency, to understand independent of ? is also (?). therefore this feeling of total exertion\nnever (comes about)? I realize there is the experience, when I hear the basketball, so I realize that there is\nan experience, and there is the penetrating insight that you see clearly then the experience becomes\n374\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nnormal. but the penetrating insight (of anatta) itself does not include deep total exertion. (theres) some\nother experience, some other kind of insight that you have to penetrate. the bond is still there. that is why\nyou come to phase 6. .. the hindrance.. like anatta experience, very normal.\nWhy sometimes for example you, like now, after anatta insight your experience becomes very clear right?\nBut you are only getting very mini, like mini, like suddenly you become total activity, sometimes? On and\noff right? Why? So this tells us that there is this bond that you have not penetrated. I’m also the same until\nfew years ago, I told you right, it is like that one. You have to penetrate through insight, then you see, then\nthe experience of total exertion will come. Understand? This is not saying this state is higher or what. This\nbond (?) (there is no strict linear way) how it happens first. (Just that) When you release this bond, this\nexperience will come. So the other two is (?) whatever arises, releases you. These are the three experiences\nthat the entire (?) and the realization of it is important. It is not saying you see emptiness then it is higher\nthan total exertion and if you see total exertion it is higher than anatta. It is seeing this bond (?) and clearly\n(?) so that you cannot understand. This bond to consciousness is the most important thing. Means that\nconsciousness is like a kind of (?) hypnotism.\nDo you know there is this person that does mind reading (?). He ask someone to look at three cards - a\ncircle, a triangle, and a square. And that person sees, and he says you see this by yourself these three cards\nright? What are they? The person replies – a circle (?), a rectangle, and a square. And he says are you very\nvery sure? Yes I’m very sure! And he shows the three cards, and (?) eh? Its impossible (?) it was a rectangle\nSo consciousness is like that. It is just like when you conceive duality, subject and object, you will have no\nway of breaking through. It is like when someone plant a (?) inside, you cannot break through. It is a magical\nspell. You are unable to penetrate. ignorance itself implies deep, ignorance implies something that is very\nvery deep. That has always been like that. Understand? So it takes many many years, just to break this\nsimple little thing that is ? ignorance. It is just like this only. It is like me asking Mr. J, despite his 30 years of\npractice and he said it is nothing new, and yet it is something very very valuable. It is 30 years! Life has how\nmany 30 years? To consciousness, that is the most important thing. You understand?” - Transcript with\nThusness 2012 - Group Gathering\nPitfalls and Dangers of One Mind\nAt the One Mind phase, there is still the reification of an unchanging consciousness, and for some an\nunchanging and universal consciousness. The pitfalls of the One Mind phase can also be present in the I\nAm phase, as explained in the chapter on reifying Host and Guest (in One Mind, the Host is now seen to\nsubsume all Guests and be inseparable with them, instead of being absolutely distinct and separate from\nthem as in the I AM phase, however the Host is still as Absolute and Unchanging).\n375\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\n“This [phase 4] is the beginning of seeing through no-self. Insight into no-self has arisen but non-dual\nexperience is still very much 'Brahman' rather than 'Sunyata'; in fact it is more Brahman than ever. Now \"I\nAMness\" is experienced in All.\nNevertheless it is a very important key phase where the practitioner experiences a quantum leap in\nperception untying the dualistic knot. This is also the key insight leading to the realization that \"All is\nMind\", all is just this One Reality.\nThe tendency to extrapolate an Ultimate Reality or Universal Consciousness where we are part of this\nReality remains surprisingly strong.

Weith wrote:\nA Zen Exploration of the Bahiya Sutta\n“There is no end to the process of awakening, but in Zen Buddhism there are steps and strategies. These\nintroductory posts will explain my position, what I discovered so far, and how it unfolds.\nHaving got hold of the ox, one has realized the One Mind. In Zen literature this One Mind has often been\ncompared to a bright mirror that reflects phenomena and yet remains untouched by appearances. As\ndiscussed with one of Sheng-yen's first Western students, this One Mind is still an illusion. One is not\nanymore identified to the self-center, ego and personality, yet one (the man) is still holding to pure non-\ndual awareness (the ox). Having tamed the ox, the ox-herder must let go of the ox (ox forgotten) and then\nforget himself and the ox (ox and man forgotten).\nThe problem is that we still maintain a subtle duality between what we know ourself to be, a pure non-\ndual awareness that is not a thing, and our daily existence often marked by self-contractions. Hoping to\nget more and more identified with pure non-dual awareness, we may train concentration, try to hold on\nto the event of awakening reifying an experience, or rationalize the whole thing to conclude that self-\ncontraction is not a problem and that suffering is not suffering because our true nature is ultimately\nbeyond suffering. This explains why I got stuck in what Zen calls \"stagnating waters\" for about a year.\n378\nSTAGE 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity\nThis is however not seen as a problem in other traditions such as Advaita Vedanta where the One Mind is\nidentified with the Brahman that contains and manifests the three states of waking, dreaming and deep\nsleep within itself, yet remains untouched by its dreamlike manifestation.”\nQuestion: “When you say that many teachers are stuck at I AM and ONE MIND, what do those teachers\nreify? Since usually in Buddhism, contrary to Vedanta, there isn't a single consciousness, what is it that\nthey subsume everything into? I ask this because I'm interested in seeing the 4 stage model (I AM, ONE\nMIND, ANATTA, SHUNYATA) from an exclusively Buddhist point of view, instead of an hybrid of Vedanta\nand Buddhism.”\nSoh’s reply:\n“Depends. I have seen many Buddhist teachers reify I AM, many reify One Mind, while some have realised\nanatta and emptiness.\nBy the way it is not necessary to get stuck with a belief in universal consciousness to get stuck at I AM or\none mind. Even non Buddhist systems like Samkhya is about I AM but each I AM is individual. And as I\nwrote in AtR guide there are different phases of I AM - those who gone through impersonality are more\nprone to reifying the universal, until insight into anatta arise at least. I would try to avoid naming names\nof Buddhist masters here as it is a sensitive topic.. but for example, people like Judith Blackstone (I don’t\nthink there are students of Judith Blackstone here? Haha) are stuck at One Mind without a belief in\nuniversal consciousness - she accepts that it is an extrapolation that cannot be confirmed experientially\nwhether nondual consciousness is universal and says she does not hold this belief afaik but she is\ncertainly at the one mind phase. Means unchanging undivided consciousness subsuming all changing\nphenomena.\nI have seen many Theravadin, Zen and Tibetan masters and teachers reify universal awareness.\nI reckon so many Chan/Zen teachers conceive a universal consciousness partly due to doctrinal influence.\nFor example the The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana of Ashvagosha talks about One Mind and that text\nhas been criticised by Lopon Malcolm to be holding a view similar to Advaita Vedanta but this text is\nusually taken as authoritative in Chinese Buddhism, and even Huang Po talks about One Mind in a way\nthat sounds like that or is often interpreted that way, e.g. “All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are\nnothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is\nno distinction between the Buddha and sentient beings.” Of course, there are those like Dogen that re-\ninterpretes One Mind in a way that makes it congruent with anatta. And Soto Zen masters like Steve\nHagen are very clear about anatta, his use of the term is congruent with anatta, “This Mind is nothing\nother than the Whole. It's simply thus, the fabric of the world itself - the ongoing arising and falling away\nthat are matter, energy and events.”\nBut that is not the case for most. I have seen many teachers of Chinese Buddhism who hold the view of\nuniversal awareness from I AM to one mind. It is an influence of the 宇宙本体论 (doctrine of universal\n379\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nsubstratum). There is a text also taken as authoritative in Chinese Buddhism, 宇宙万有本体论, although I\nam not sure if it is a substantialist text (have not studied it).\nIn Tibetan Buddhism side, I have seen a few masters (although more infrequently than Chinese\nBuddhism) elude to universal awareness, but generally even if they do not, they often still reify an\nunchanging awareness that is one’s innermost essence. Meaning I AM is reified like an unchanging\nbackground of pure awareness, or one mind subsuming all phenomena. The sky and clouds, mirror and\nreflections that AtR talks about in the one mind chapter often gets reified, that is very common. I have\nseen many Tibetan books just talking about I AM, some one mind, etc. It is rare even in Tibetan Buddhism\ntoday (but this applies to any tradition) to break through to no mirror and anatta and emptiness, but as I\nmentioned there are some. Then as for Thai Forest Theravada, as I mentioned many get stuck at Poo Roo\n(Witness) and one master that broke through that got stuck at one mind. It is very common in awareness\nteachings to get stuck there. Therefore, the Thusness 7 stages can help and do apply to all traditions,\nwhatever tradition one is following so that one has a clearer direction and can avoid the pitfalls.”\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-\nSelf / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“There is no mirror reflecting\nAll along manifestation alone is.\nThe one hand claps\nEverything IS!”\n- John Tan, 2006\n“But what exactly is this “witness” we are talking about?

During the process of transition from 'Witness'\nto 'no Witness' some experience the manifestation as itself being intelligence, some experience it as\nimmense vitality, some experience it as tremendous clarity and some, all 3 qualities explode into one\nsingle moment.

And would the structure impose an 'I' upon the experience like imposing a separate lightning\ndifferent from the flashing of the light? Is there a lightning separate from the flashing which does the\nflasing or is the flashing itself the lightning? But flashing is an action a verb, the lightning is a noun, an\nobject. Or is the 'Light' distinct from the flasing created merely by the langauge? Likewise, is there an 'I'\nthat sees or is the act of seeing specified by the Alice in Wonderland language 'Tabling' itself the 'I' the\nseer? But I is a pronoun, seer a noun and seeing/tabling are verbs. When I say 'I see', this is a seeing I. This\n'I' is defined by the 'seeing'. Now there are two questions here.’” – Soh, 2021\n“The basic nature has no nature. To negate the \"inherentness\" of nature is to directly see and taste the\ndynamism of one's empty clarity. To negate \"color\" as \"no color\" is to see and experience the rainbow of\ncolours. There is no neutral state to hold on to, the neutral state is a state fabricated by the conceptual\nmind as that is the further it can go conceptually. If one tries to maintain a state of \"neutrality\" of neither\nthis nor that, then he will be imobilized -- therefore no \"no color\". To be free is to fully open to whatever\nis, for whatever appears is just one's radiance clarity. Therefore anatta is a crucial experiential taste and\ninsight.” – John Tan, 2021\n“(8:40 PM) Thusness: it is very difficult to move from substantialist non-dual to anatta. even after arising\ninsight of anatta, there is still this problem. very often you need to have clarity in DO to rid it...that is using\nDO to refine the experience of anatta. so when a person undergoes awareness practice until a certain\nphase (non-dual), it is very very important to keep instilling the right view, keep breaking the essence. for\nthis, a certain amount of faith in the teacher is very important. otherwise one will not be able to progress\nto the next phase. even if you have undergone the experience, you will not be able to realize anatta, until\npractitioners realized that it is not necessary to have 'essence' at all...it is just simply a distorted view\n(8:45 PM) AEN: the experience of D.O.?\n(8:46 PM) Thusness: no anatta\n(8:46 PM) AEN: oh icic. experience of anatta like a glimpse of no mind experience?\n(8:46 PM) Thusness: yeah. like luckystrike... there is the experience of no mind. so for you, there must be\nwillingness to let go of the 'wrong view' entirely, then with the experience of no-mind and realization, the\nadoption of the view carries you...until you perfect the experience. then the doubts is completely gone.\nyour entire experience transcend the entire idea of 'essence'. the center is completely gone...just flat,\ndisjoint, unsupported, dimensionless and pure experience, manifested as whatever arises. this is very\nimportant and must take note. otherwise you will not be able to advice correctly” – Conversation with\nJohn Tan, early 2011\n“\"View informing realization\" means your underlying assumptions about mind and reality in general will\nmore often than not, color your experiential insights.

Why is this so? Because as Buddha taught, Appropriated Aggregates\nare Suffering - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/08/what-does-it-mean-that-appropriated.html -\n- which means all aggregates tainted with I-making and mine-making are suffering. There can be no\nliberation from suffering without realizing and actualizing anatta. This is why of the 7 Stages of Thusness,\nonly stage 5 onwards are considered the key important insights of Buddhism. Stages before Stage 5 are in\nfact not considered ‘Buddhist enlightenment’ and can be found in other religions.\nTo get an introductory understanding of Buddha’s teachings, check out this book: What the Buddha\nTaught by Walpola Rahula\n“Depending on the conditions of an individual, it may not be obvious that it is “always thought watching\nthought rather than a watcher watching thought.” or \"the watcher is that thought.\" Because this is the key\ninsight and a step that cannot afford to be wrong along the path of liberation, I cannot help but with\nsome disrespectful tone say,\nFor those masters that taught,\n“Let thoughts arise and subside,\nSee the background mirror as perfect and be unaffected.”\nWith all due respect, they have just “blah” something nice but deluded.\nRather,\nSee that there is no one behind thoughts.\nFirst, one thought then another thought.\nWith deepening insight it will later be revealed,\nAlways just this, One Thought!\nNon-arising, luminous yet empty!” – John Tan, 2009, On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and\nOrdinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\n“Soh Wei Yu\n25m ·\n389\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nShared with Your friends\nThis explanation by Geoff on anatta is very good.

Measureless Mind PDF: https://app.box.com/s/nxby5606lbaei9oudiz6xsyrdasacqph\nThe Recognition of Selflessness (Anattasaññā)\nLook at the world and see its emptiness Mogharāja, always mindful,\nEliminating the view of self, one goes beyond death.\nOne who views the world this way is not seen by the king of death.\n— Sutta Nipāta 5.15, Mogharājamāṇavapucchā\nThe contemplation of selflessness is given in AN 10.60 Girimānanda Sutta:\nNow what, Ānanda, is the recognition of selflessness? Here, Ānanda, a monk, gone to the wilderness, to\nthe root of a tree, or to an empty place, discriminates thus: ‘The eye is not-self, forms are not-self; the ear\nis not-self, sounds are not-self; the nose is not-self, odors are not-self; the tongue is not-self, flavors are\nnot-self; the body is not-self, tactual objects are not-self; the mind is not-self, phenomena are not-self.’\nThus he abides contemplating selflessness with regard to the six internal and external sensory spheres.\nThis, Ānanda, is called the recognition of selflessness.\nIn practice, we need to be able to recognize this absence of self in our immediate experience: When\nseeing, there is the coming together of visible form, the eye, and visual consciousness. When hearing,\nthere is the coming together of sound, the ear, and auditory consciousness. When touching, there is the\ncoming together of tactual sensation, the body, and tactile consciousness. When thinking, there is the\nthought, the mind, and mental consciousness. These processes arise simply through ‘contact.’ When a\nsense faculty and a sensory object make contact, the corresponding sensory consciousness arises. This\nentire process occurs through specific conditionality (idappaccayatā). There is no independent, fully\nautonomous agent or self controlling any of this.\nAn independent, autonomous self would, by definition, be:\n1. permanent\n390\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n2. satisfactory\n3. not prone to dis-ease\n4. fully self-determining (be in complete autonomous control of itself)\nThus, what is being negated is a permanent, satisfactory self which is not prone to old age, sickness, and\ndeath. As SN 22.59 Pañcavaggiya Sutta (abridged) states:\nMonks, form, feeling, recognition, fabrications, and consciousness are not-self. Were form, feeling,\nrecognition, fabrications, or consciousness self, then this form, feeling, recognition, fabrications, and\nconsciousness would not lead to dis-ease.\nThis criterion of dis-ease is the context for the following statement that:\nNone can have it of form, feeling, recognition, fabrications, or consciousness: ‘Let my form, feeling,\nrecognition, fabrications, or consciousness be thus, let my form, feeling, recognition, fabrications, or\nconsciousness be not thus.’\nBy engaging in sustained, dedicated contemplation we find only impermanent processes, conditionally\narisen, and not fully self-determining. First we clearly see that all conditioned phenomena of body and\nmind are impermanent. Next we come to see that whatever is impermanent is unsatisfactory in that it\ncan provide no lasting happiness. Then we realize that all impermanent, unsatisfactory phenomena of\nbody and mind are not-self — they can’t be the basis for a self, which by definition would be permanent\nand (one would hope) satisfactory. This relationship between the recognition of impermanence, the\nrecognition of unsatisfactoriness, and the recognition of selflessness is illustrated in the following\ndiagram.\nWith the recognition of selflessness there is an emptying out of both the “subject” and “object” aspects of\nexperience. We come to understand that “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to the mind and body\nas well as all external representations is deluded. When the recognition of selflessness is fully developed\nthere is no longer any reification of substantial referents to be experienced in relation to subjective\ngrasping. Whatever is seen is merely the seen (diṭṭhamatta). Whatever is heard or sensed is merely the\nheard (sutamatta) and merely the sensed (mutamatta). Whatever is known is merely the known\n(viññātamatta). This is explained in Ud 1.10 Bāhiya Sutta:\n\"Then, Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In\nreference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the\ncognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When for you there will be only the\nseen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to\nthe sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bāhiya, there is no you in connection\n391\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nwith that. When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there,\nyou are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.\"\nWhen there is no self to be found one’s experience becomes very simple, direct, and uncluttered. When\nseeing, there is the coming together of visible form, the eye, and visual consciousness, that’s all. There is\nno separate “seer.” The seer is entirely dependent upon the seen. There can be no seer independent of\nthe seen. There is no separate, independent subject or self.\nThis is also the case for the sensory object. The “seen” is entirely dependent upon the eye faculty and\nvisual consciousness. There can be no object seen independent of the eye faculty and cognition. This is\nthe case for all possible sensory objects. There is no separate, independent sensory object.\nThe same holds true for sensory consciousness as well. “Seeing” is entirely dependent upon the eye and\nvisible form. There can be no seeing independent of the eye and cognition. This is the case for all possible\nsensory cognitions. There is no separate, independent sensory consciousness.\nIt’s important to understand this experientially. Let’s take the straightforward empirical experience of you\nlooking at this screen right now as an example. Conventionally speaking, you could describe the\nexperience as “I see the computer screen.” Another way of describing this is that there’s a “seer” who\n“sees” the “seen.” But look at the screen: are there really three independent and separate parts to your\nexperience? Or are “seer,” “sees,” and “seen,” just three conceptual labels applied to this experience in\nwhich the three parts are entirely interdependent?\nThe “seer,” “seen,” and “seeing” are all empty and insubstantial. The eye faculty, visible form, and visual\nconsciousness are all interdependent aspects of the same experience. You can’t peel one away and still\nhave a sensory experience — there is no separation. AN 4.24 Kāḷakārāma Sutta:\nThus, monks, the Tathāgata does not conceive an [object] seen when seeing what is to be seen. He does\nnot conceive an unseen. He does not conceive a to-be-seen. He does not conceive a seer.\nHe does not conceive an [object] heard when hearing what is to be heard. He does not conceive an\nunheard. He does not conceive a to-be-heard. He does not conceive a hearer.\nHe does not conceive an [object] sensed when sensing what is to be sensed. He does not conceive an\nunsensed. He does not conceive a to-be-sensed. He does not conceive a senser.\nHe does not conceive an [object] known when knowing what is to be known. He does not conceive an\nunknown. He does not conceive a to-be-known. He does not conceive a knower.\n392\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSensory consciousness can’t be isolated as separate and independent. Nor can any of these other\ninterdependent phenomena. Even the designations that we apply to these various phenomena are\nentirely conventional, dependent designations. But this doesn’t mean that we should now interpret our\nexperience as being some sort of cosmic oneness or unity consciousness or whatever one may want to\ncall it. That's just another empty, dependent label isn’t it? The whole point of this analysis is to see the\nemptiness of all referents, and thereby stop constructing and defining a “self.”\nThe purpose of correctly engaging in the contemplation of selflessness is stated in AN 7.49 Dutiyasaññā\nSutta:\n‘The recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of\ngreat fruit and benefit; it merges with the death-free, has the death-free as its end.’ Thus it was said. In\nreference to what was it said?\nMonks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with the recognition of selflessness in what is\nunsatisfactory, his mind is rid of “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to this conscious body and\nexternally with regard to all representations, and has transcended conceit, is at peace, and is well\nliberated.\nIf, monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with the recognition of selflessness in\nwhat is unsatisfactory, his mind is not rid of “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to this conscious\nbody and externally with regard to all representations, and has not transcended conceit, is not at peace,\nand is not well liberated, then he should know, ‘I have not developed the recognition of selflessness in\nwhat is unsatisfactory, there is no stepwise distinction in me, I have not obtained the strength of\ndevelopment.’ In that way he is fully aware there. But if, monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains\nacquainted with the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, his mind is rid of “I-making” and\n“mine-making” with regard to this conscious body and externally with regard to all representations, and\nhas transcended conceit, is at peace, and is well liberated, then he should know, ‘I have developed the\nrecognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, there is stepwise distinction in me, I have obtained\nthe strength of development.’ In that way he is fully aware there.\n‘The recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of\ngreat fruit and benefit; it merges with the death-free, has the death-free as its end.’ Thus it was said. And\nin reference to this it was said.\nHere we get to the heart of the matter, which is one of the most subtle aspects of the Buddhadhamma.\nSimply stated: when ignorance ceases, belief in self simultaneously ceases. And when there is no self to\nbe found, then there is no self to die or take birth. This right here is “death-free.” And it is precisely this\nthat the Buddha is declaring when he says to Mogharāja:\nLook at the world and see its emptiness Mogharāja, always mindful,\nEliminating the view of self, one goes beyond death.\n393\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nOne who views the world this way is not seen by the king of death.\nWhen one completely abandons the underlying tendencies which give rise to mistaken apprehensions of\na self — any and all notions of “I am” — then there is no self to die. This stilling of the “currents of\nconceiving” over one’s imagined self, and the resulting peace that is empty of birth, aging, and death, is\nstraightforwardly presented in MN 140 Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta:\n‘He has been stilled where the currents of conceiving do not flow. And when the currents of conceiving do\nnot flow, he is said to be a sage at peace.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said?\nMonk, “I am” is a conceiving. “I am this” is a conceiving. “I shall be” is a conceiving. “I shall not be” ... “I shall\nbe possessed of form” ... “I shall be formless” ... “I shall be percipient” ... “I shall be non-percipient” ... “I\nshall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient” is a conceiving. Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a\ncancer, conceiving is an arrow. By going beyond all conceiving, monk, he is said to be a sage at peace.\nFurthermore, a sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die. He is unagitated, and is free from\nlonging. He has nothing whereby he would be born. Not being born, how could he age? Not aging, how\ncould he die? Not dying, how could he be agitated? Not being agitated, for what will he long?\nSo it was in reference to this that it was said, ‘He has been stilled where the currents of conceiving do not\nflow. And when the currents of conceiving do not flow, he is said to be a sage at peace.’\nTruly, “a sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die.” In this way, when ignorance ceases, the\nentire complex of conditioned arising bound up with dissatisfaction also ceases. When all traces of “I-\nmaking” and “mine-making” are abandoned through the fully integrated threefold training of ethical\nconduct, meditation, and discernment, just this is dispassion (virāga). Just this is cessation (nirodha). Just\nthis is extinguishment (nibbāna). Just this is without outflows (anāsava). Just this is not-born (ajāta), not-\nbecome (abhūta), not-made (akata), not-fabricated (asaṅkhata), endless (ananta), indestructible\n(apalokita), and yes, death-free (amata). It is freedom (mutti).\nThe Recognition of Selflessness and the Seven Factors of Awakening (Satta Bojjhaṅgā):\nSustained, dedicated practice of the recognition of selflessness will gradually create the optimal\nconditions for the arising of all seven factors of awakening. SN 46.73 Anatta Sutta (abridged):\nHere monks, a monk develops the awakening factor of mindfulness accompanied by the recognition of\nselflessness in what is unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in\nletting go. He develops the awakening factor of dhamma-investigation accompanied by the recognition of\nselflessness in what is unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in\nletting go. He develops the awakening factor of energy accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in\nwhat is unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He\n394\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ndevelops the awakening factor of joy accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is\nunsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops\nthe awakening factor of tranquility accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is\nunsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops\nthe awakening factor of meditative composure accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is\nunsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops\nthe awakening factor of equanimity accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is\nunsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go.\nIt is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so\nthat it is of great fruit and benefit. It is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in what is\nunsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so that one of two fruits is to be expected: either final gnosis in\nthis very life or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning. It is in this way that the\nrecognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so that it leads to great\ngood. It is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is developed and\ncultivated so that it leads to great security from bondage. It is in this way that the recognition of\nselflessness in what is unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so that it leads to a great sense of\nurgency. It is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is developed and\ncultivated so that it leads to dwelling in great comfort.”\n“[8:04 PM, 3/24/2021] John Tan: There is a msg I remember when I was in FB quite few years ago.

Or perhaps liberation becomes\nsuperfluous with the realization that there is no one to be liberated!\"\nSoh:\nIt does lead to liberation.\nJamgon Mipham Rinpoche:\n\"Why is it that all sentient beings think that there is a self? The self is not conceived of because it exists. In\nfact, although it does not exist, there is merely a conception that it exists because of an erroneous mind\nthat is deluded and mistaken about its existence. This is similar to perceiving a rope to be a snake or like\nseeing a young lady [as real] in a dream.\nIt might be thought that if there is a self, then it is reasonable to be bound to samsara by afflictions and to\nbecome liberated when cutting through that bondage. However, if there were no self, who then becomes\nliberated? Therefore, it would be unreasonable to strive to liberate the self!\nIt is not the case that one strives to liberate an existent self. For instance, if you are frightened when\nmistaking a rope for a snake, you will feel relieved when you see that there is no snake. Similarly, by\nconceiving of a self where there is no self, you accumulate afflictions and karma and thereby continuously\nexperience suffering in samsara. When realizing the lack of self through authentic insight, karma and\nafflictions will cease to be and you will be liberated. Therefore, what is called “liberation” is merely the\ncessation of a mistake in your mind-stream or the cessation of your deluded mind. There is no liberation\nof an existent self. If there were a self, then ego-clinging could never be turned away, and if this ego-\nclinging is not relinquished, then karma and afflictions do not cease. Thus, due to being attached to the\nself, you continuously enter samsara. —A FEAST ON THE NECTAR OF THE SUPREME VEHICLE, 102–3\"\nDuckworth, Douglas; Mipam, Jamgon.

All my likes and dislikes? My personality traits?\nMy beliefs?\nKyle Dixon: It is more so that there is ultimately no separate self as an entity which possesses those traits.\nThe self is a mere construct which is only those traits, and so on. In actuality however, those traits do not\ntruly construct an entity. The entity or self is inferred, and we use that inference as a tool for engaging\nwith and navigating experience, but we mistake that inference to be a referent, meaning we become\nentrenched in the nexus of conditions and come to view the self as an inherently real entity.\nThe actual meaning of selflessness in these teachings revolves around the non-conceptual, direct\nrealization that there in fact is no inherent self, or any self at all for that matter. This results from\nrecognizing that there is no thinker of thought, no separate feeler of feelings, no seer of sights, no hearer\nof sound, and so on.\nHere is Sera Khandro, a prominent 19th/20th century practitioner discussing the self:\nA literal definition of the term “individual” is as follows: The two obscurations, along with habitual patterns, fill\nan individual’s stream of being; and the contaminated aggregation of attachment forms the foundation for the\nindividual. What is called “the self” is the consciousness predisposed to assume the existence of a self: during the\nperiods of waking life, dream, transitional states [bardos] between lifetimes, or in a future life, a self merely\nappears when none exists. That consciousness is what is called “an individual self.” Immediately thereafter,\nsubsequent knowing and discursive thought give clarity to the consciousness predisposed to cling to an “I” where\nthere is none, and a sense of self where none exists, and make them stable and solid.\n…\nWhat does Buddhism mean when they say there is no self\nKyle Dixon: Selflessness means there is ultimately no actual subject, which means there is no actual\ninternal reference point that is apprehending sensory phenomena.\nIn describing this simply it means through your practice you will hopefully, eventually, awaken to\nrecognize that there is no actual seer of sights, no hearer of sounds, and so on. The feeling of an internal\nseer or hearer, etc., is a useful but false construct that is created and fortified by various causes and\nconditions.\nWe suffer when we cling to this construct and think it is actually real. Recognition of the actual nature of\nthat construct is liberating and freeing.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\n“Once I was a Body.\nLater I became a Name.\nSoon after I am merely I.\nThen, there never was an I.\nNow,\n399\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nwhat else besides those words forming on the screen!” - John Tan, 2006\n“The Stanza One complements and refines Stanza Two to make the experience of no-self thorough and\neffortless into just only chirping birds, drum beats, footsteps, sky, mountain, walking, chewing and tasting;\nno witness whatsoever hiding anywhere!

His final view remains that of 'the reflection and the mirror is not the same' - one\nbeing the changeless sole reality of the superimpositions of other transient phenomena. Although in\nterms of no mind experience it is similar, the view and realization differs (therefore always the\nimportance of AtR's emphasis on distinguishing view, realization and experience) - without the correct\nrealizations the experience of no-mind cannot be effortless and become a natural state, there will always\nbe the tendency to subtly reference and abide and leave traces in the Absolute. Anatta realization is key\nto being free from reference-point, non-abiding and free from leaving traces, as an ultimate cannot be\nfound besides the relative.\nSomeone who realizes anatta will have a paradigm shift as clear as day. Anatta is the realisation that\nthere never was a [truly existing] mind/Mind/Awareness/Brahman/Presence/Ultimate Reality/etc etc.\n401\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMind, Awareness, Seeing, etc, all these are just conventions for the ongoing appearance. There is simply\nno seer-seeing-seen. Having such a realization, one simply stops projecting an ultimate substance or\nsubstratum. I remember right after anatta, it was a very obvious shift. I no longer see consciousness as a\n'substance' holding all appearances. Rather 'consciousness' is just the mere event and manifestation\nhappening or dependently originating without agent, there isn't even a single thought about\n'consciousness', just the self-luminous event/manifestation happening or gaplessly and non-dually\nappearing at no distance, that's all. No self/Self or static source and substratum or reality underlying all.\nCompletely dynamic and centerless and boundless and seamless beyond/free of the threefold structures\nof subject-action-object, seer-seeing-seen. As I wrote before, even the notion that 'consciousness is\nmodulating as everything' falls apart. All these can be found in my e-journal entries right after my anatta\nrealization.\nAt that point, I was in fact closer in view to Actual Freedom than Yogacara. Subjective idealism holds no\nappeal to me anymore after that realisation of anatta.\nDependent origination and emptiness is then another leap that liberates the 'foreground'.\n\"So what is one mind, what is no mind and what is original mind in this context? One mind is post non-\ndual but subsuming leaving trace. No mind is just one mind except that there is evenness till the last trace\nis gone. Like what explains in the text. Uji...all is time therefore no time. When you go from dual to non\ndual or one mind to no mind, those are stages and experiences... If you got the condition to get pointed\nout that originally there never was a mind, there are no stages to climb... that is original mind. This\nrequires insights and wisdom.\" - John Tan, 2020\n“_____, what Albert is talking is more of:\n1. Mountains as mountains, and waters as waters.\n2. No mountain, no water\n3.

The Buddha has specifically described and named these\nviews, and they are all grouped under sakkaya ditthi, the erroneous view of self.

He attained the\ngoal of the Upanishadic path taught by his two Samkhya teachers (the Samkhya path aims at a liberation\nthat consist of realizing immaterial Purusha – pure consciousness as true self), and despite approval and\nconfirmation from his two teachers, felt dissatisfied and left them in search of genuine liberation under\nthe Bodhi tree prior to his full awakening.\nIn many teachings, the Buddha directly repudiated the Atman-Brahman teaching. One of them can be\nfound in the famous Bahiya Sutta from the Udana, the scripture that made me realise anatta back in 2010\n(see: https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html ,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html ,\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-breakthrough.html , A Zen Exploration of the\nBahiya Sutta )\nAccording to notes from Leigh Brasington in http://www.leighb.com/ud1_10.htm :\n404\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n1. The bark cloth clothing would most likely mean that Bahiya was a follower of the Brhadaranyaka\nUpanishad. The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad makes a big deal about trees (personal communication from\nJohn Peacock).\n2. Why did the Buddha give this particular instruction to Bahiya? The bark cloth clothing marked him as a\nserious student of the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad; thus he would be familiar with the teaching found\nthere: \"The unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought thinker, the uncognized cognizer... There is\nno other seer but he, no other hearer, no other thinker, no other cognizer. This is thy self, the inner\ncontroller, the immortal....\" Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 3.7.23.\nBahiya would also be familiar with \"... that imperishable is the unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the\nunthought thinker, the ununderstood understander. Other than it there is naught that sees. Other than it\nthere is naught that hears. Other than it there is naught that thinks. Other than it there is naught that\nunderstands....\" Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 3.8.11.\nThe Buddha, as he often does, takes something his questioner is familiar with and gives it a subtle but\nprofound twist: there's no Atman, there's just seeing, just hearing, etc.“ – Soh, 2020\n“In this way of experiencing things, we have something that aligns with things that the Buddha taught. We\nhave from the Udana, \"In the seeing, just the seen, in the hearing, just the heard, in the thinking, just the\nthought,\" etc. In short, there are just the sensations, the transient sensations, and nothing more, no self\nto be unified with them, no separate thing perceiving them, just transient causality as it is, where it is, just\nbeing itself.” - Daniel M. Ingram\n“...the \"light\" of awareness is in things where they are, including all of the space between/around/through\nthem equally… Said another way, things just are aware/manifest/occurring where they are just as they\nare, extremely straightforwardly.” - Daniel M. Ingram\n“He (Soh: Daniel Ingram) is talking about the effortlessness of 'in seeing, just the seen' as primordial\nawareness of an arahat (Soh: definition in Daniel M. Ingram’s book, not necessarily in complete alignment with\nscriptural version). Anagami is the beginning of seeing, like that of the different levels of one taste (Soh: the\nmaps of Mahamudra). Primordial awareness is realized when one realizes there is no such thing as\nprimordial awareness that is different from the field of transient manifestation.” - John Tan, 2007\n“Thanks for sharing. Although the message carries invaluable advice, it is important not to mistake\n\"seeing things just as they are” as \"not forcing oneself to be more than what one is ”. Such ‘growing\nwisdom’ of teaching us how to deal with ourselves does not make Ananda an Arhat.\nIn my opinion, it will be more advisable to think that Ananda is pondering over a question similar to what\nBuddha had taught Bahiya in Bahiya Sutta that ‘in hearing, just the heard’. Ananda struggled hard to\npenetrate the profound teaching of Buddha, the meaning of Anatta. He finally realized the truth of anatta\nthereby freeing himself from artificial struggle. There is no Ananda to attain Arhatship. ‘In hearing, it is\n405\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ntruly only just sound, no hearer’. Always so regardless of one’s depth of understanding, anatta remains a\ndharma seal, effortlessly so!\nMy 2 cents.” – John Tan, 2008, https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/01/thusnesss-conversation-\nbetween-2004-to.html\n“Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus: in the seen will be merely what is seen, ... in the cognized will\nmerely be what is cognized. Practising in this way, Bāhiya, you will not be 'because of that'. When you are\nnot 'because of that', you will not be 'in that'. And when you are not 'in that', you will be neither here nor\nbeyond nor in between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.\"\nWhat does it mean \"you will not be 'because of that'\"? The Pāli is na tena. Tena is the instrumental of the\nword for 'that'. Na is the negative. It means, literally, \"not because of that, not through that, not by that\". It\nmeans in essence, you will not assume that there is a self, a soul, a me; because of, through, or by; the\nseen or the heard or the sensed or the cognized. The Buddha is saying that once you have penetrated the\ntruth of sensory experience, by suppressing the Hindrances through Jhāna, you will see that there is no\n'doer', nor a 'knower', behind sensory experience. No longer will you be able to use sensory experience as\nevidence for a self. Descartes' famous \"I am because I think\" is refuted. You will not be because of\nthinking, nor because of seeing, hearing or sensing. In the Buddha's words, \"You will not be because of\nthat (any sensory experience)\".\nWhen the sensory processes are discarded as tenable evidence for a self, a soul or a me, then you are no\nlonger located in the sensory experience. In the Buddha's words, \"You will not be 'in that'\". You no longer\nview, perceive or even think that there is a 'me' involved in life. In the words of the doctor in the original\nseries of Star Trek, \"It is life, Jim, but not as we know it\"! There is no longer any sense of self, or soul, at the\ncentre of experience. You are no more 'in that'.\nJust to close off the loophole that you might think you can escape non-existence of a self or soul by\nidentifying with a transcendental state of being beyond what is seen, heard, sensed or cognized, the\nBuddha thunders, \"and you will be neither here (with the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor beyond\n(outside of the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor in between the two (neither of the world nor beyond\nthe world). The last phrase comprehensively confounded the sophists!\nIn summary, the Buddha advised both Bāhiya and Venerable Mālunkyaputta to experience the Jhānas to\nsuppress the Five Hindrances. Thereby one will discern with certainty the absence of a self or a soul\nbehind the sensory process. Consequently, sensory experience will never again be taken as evidence of a\n'knower' or a 'doer': such that you will never imagine a self or a soul at the centre of experience, nor\nbeyond, nor anywhere else. Bāhiya's Teaching put in a nutshell the way to the realization of No-Self,\nAnattā. \"Just this\", concluded the Buddha \"is the end of suffering\".” – Ajahn Brahmavamso,\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Ajahn_Brahm_BAHIYA_S_TEACHING.htm , also, he explained\n406\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nanatta from 56 minutes onwards in this video (prior to 56 minutes mark, the explanation focuses on\ncultivating samadhi): https://youtu.be/RYbe7W7XRu8\nAlthough Ajahn Brahmavamso is one of the rare Theravadin masters currently living that is likely to have\nrealised anatta, Soh does not agree that the jhana-first approach is an approach that is suitable for\neveryone but perhaps for some only, see Jhana / Dhyana\n“To have completely cut off all misconceptions regarding the indivisibility of phenomena and mind, and to\nmerge mind and phenomena free of hope and fear is said to happen at the time of the greater level of\none taste.” - The Royal Seal of Mahamudra, Khamtrul Rinpoche\nKhamtrul Rinpoche on the realization of anatta in the Mahamudra text (recommended reading!):\n\"At that point, is the observer—awareness—other than the observed—stillness and movement—or is it\nactually that stillness and movement itself? By investigating with the gaze of your own awareness, you\ncome to understand that that which is investigating itself is also no other than stillness and movement.\nOnce this happens you will experience lucid emptiness as the naturally luminous self-knowing awareness.\nUltimately, whether we say nature and radiance, undesirable and antidote, observer and observed,\nmindfulness and thoughts, stillness and movement, etc., you should know that the terms of each pair are\nno different from one another; by receiving the blessing of the guru, properly ascertain that they are\ninseparable.

Ferguson, p 76):\nA monk asked, “Master, why do you say that mind is Buddha?”\nMazu said, “To stop babies from crying.”\nThe monk said, “What do you say when they stop crying?”\nMazu said, “No mind, no Buddha.”\nThe monk asked, “Without using either of these teachings, how would you instruct someone?”\nMazu said, “I would say to him that it’s not a thing.”\nThe monk asked, “If suddenly someone who was in the midst of it came to you, then what would you do?”\n409\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMazu said, “I would teach him to experience the great way.”\n“[8:53 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: In zen though they say there is no mind, they in fact embrace mind more\nfully than all is mind, until no trace of mind can be detected. Yet [Ven.] Sheng Yen said this is just the entry\npoint of zen because originally there is no mind and this is clearly realized in anatta. So post anatta, mind\nand phenomena are completely indistinguishable.\nIf both mind and phenomena are completely indistinguishable in experience, then distinctions are\nnothing more than conventional designation of empty luminous display.\n[8:54 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. btw did sheng yen realise anatta?\n[8:55 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: So you must know when we say no awareness, no self, no I, it doesnt\nmean nothing.

It is not that one simply goes inward by rejecting the external world. It is not\nthat the mind is pure and the world is impure. When mind is clear, the world is a pure-field. When mind is\ndeluded, the world is Samsara. Bodhidharma said,\nSeeing with insight, form is not simply form, because form depends on mind. And, mind is not simply\nmind, because mind depends on form. Mind and form create and negate each other. … Mind and the\nworld are opposites, appearances arise where they meet. When your mind does not stir inside, the world\ndoes not arise outside. When the world and the mind are both transparent, this is the true insight.” (from\nthe Wakeup Discourse)\nJust like the masters of Madhyamaka, Bodhidharma too pointed out that mind and form are\ninterdependently arising. Mind and form create each other. Yet, when you cling to form, you negate mind.\nAnd, when you cling to mind, you negate form. Only when such dualistic notions are dissolved, and only\nwhen both mind and the world are transparent (not turning to obstructing concepts) the true insight\narises.\nIn this regard, Bodhidharma said,\nUsing the mind to look for reality is delusion.\nNot using the mind to look for reality is awareness.\n(from the Wakeup Discourse)\nSo, to effectively enter the Way, one has to go beyond the dualities (conceptual constructs) of mind and\nform. As far as one looks for reality as an object of mind, one is still trapped in the net of delusion (of\nseeing mind and form as independent realities), never breaking free from it. In that way, one holds reality\nas something other than oneself, and even worse, one holds oneself as a spectator to a separate reality!\n410\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nWhen the mind does not stir anymore and settles into its pristine clarity, the world does not stir outside.\nThe reality is revealed beyond the divisions of Self and others, and mind and form. Thus, as you learn not\nto use the mind to look for reality and simply rests in the natural state of mind as it is, there is the dawn\nof pristine awareness – knowing reality as it is, non-dually and non-conceptually.\nWhen the mind does not dissolve in this way to its original clarity, whatever one sees is merely the stirring\nof conceptuality. Even if we try to construct a Buddha’s mind, it only stirs and does not see reality.\nBecause, the Buddha’s mind is simply the uncompounded clarity of Bodhi (awakening), free from stirring\nand constructions. So, Bodhidharma said,\nThat which ordinary knowledge understands is also said to be within the boundaries of the norms. When\nyou do not produce the mind of a common man, or the mind of a sravaka or a bodhisattva, and when you\ndo not even produce a Buddha-mind or any mind at all, then for the first time you can be said to have\ngone outside the boundaries of the norms. If no mind at all arises, and if you do not produce\nunderstanding nor give rise to delusion, then, for the first time, you can be said to have gone outside of\neverything. (From the Record #1, of the Collection of Bodhidharma’s Works3 retrieved from Dunhuang\nCaves)\n- Dzogchen teacher Abhaya Devi Way of Bodhi\n\"So what is one mind, what is no mind and what is original mind in this context? One mind is post non-\ndual but subsuming leaving trace. No mind is just one mind except that there is evenness till the last trace\nis gone. Like what explains in the text. Uji... all is time therefore no time. When you go from dual to non\ndual or one mind to no mind, those are stages and experiences... If you got the condition to get pointed\nout that originally there never was a mind, there are no stages to climb... that is original mind. This\nrequires insights and wisdom.\" - John Tan, 2020\n1st Zen/Ch’an Patriarch in China, Bodhidharma:\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-doctrine-of-no-mind-by-bodhidharma.html\n“The student asks the Reverend, \"[Do you] have a mind or not?\"\n\"[I] have no mind.\"\n3\n\"Since you say that you have no mind: who then has the ability to see, hear, feel, and know? Who knows\nthat there is no mind?\"\n\"Just no-mind is seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing. And it is no-mind that has the ability to be aware of\nthe absence of mind.\"\n4\n\"If one accepts that there is no mind, it must follow that there is no seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing.\nSay: how can there be any seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing [without mind]?\"\n\"Though I have no mind, I can ver[y] well [1269b] see and hear and feel and know.\"\n411\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n5\n...\n\"But how could one [even] gain the ability to know that it is no-mind [that sees, hears, feels, and knows]?\"\n\"Just try to find out in every detail: What appearance does mind have? And if it can be apprehended: is\n[what is apprehended] mind or not? Is [mind] inside or outside, or somewhere in between? As long as one\nlooks for mind in these three locations, one's search will end in failure. Indeed, searching it anywhere will\nend in failure. That's exactly why it is known as no-mind.\"\n7\n\"Reverend, since you have said that all is no-mind, neither evil nor meritorious deeds ought to exist. So\nwhy are people transmigrating in the six spheres of existence, ceaselessly embroiled in life-and-death?\"\n\"In their confusion, people for no reason conceive an [an entity called] 'mind' within no-mind. Deludedly\nclinging to [mind's] existence, they perform action upon action, which in turn makes them transmigrate in\nthe six realms and live-and-die without respite. It is as if someone would in the dark mistake a\ncontraption for a ghost or [a rope] for a snake and be gripped by terror. That's just what people's deluded\nclinging [to a mind] is like. In the midst of no-mind they deludedly cling to a 'mind' and perform action\nupon action - yet this results in nothing but transmigration through the six realms. If such people come\nacross a great teacher who instructs them in seated meditation, they will awaken to no-mind, and all\nkarmic hindrances will be thoroughly wiped out and [the chain of] life-and-death cut through. Just as all\ndarkness disappears with a single ray of sunlight that penetrates it, awakening to no-mind wipes out all\nevil karma.\"\n....\n\"At present, I am involved in [dualistic] mind; so how should I practice?\"\n\"Just be totally aware in all affairs! No-mind is nothing other than practice; there is no other practice. Thus\nyou'll realize that no-mind is everything, and that extinction (nirvana) is nothing other than no-mind.\"\n12\nAt this, the disciple all at once greatly awakened and realized for the first time that there is no thing apart\nfrom mind, and no mind apart from things. All of his actions became utterly free. Having broken through\nthe net of all doubt, he was freed of all obstruction.”\nFrom Dzogchen teacher Jamgon Mipham:\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/.../madhyamaka...\n“…In the cycle of teachings of Maitreya and the writings of the great charioteer Asaṅga, whose thinking is\none and the same, it is taught that individuals on the level of earnest aspiration first understand that all\nphenomena are simply the mind. Subsequently they have the experience that there is no object to be\napprehended in the mind. Then, at the stage of the supreme mundane level on the path of joining, they\n412\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nrealize that because there is no object, neither is there a subject, and immediately after that, they\nattain the first level with the direct realization of the truth of ultimate reality devoid of the\nduality of subject and object. As for things being only the mind, the source of the dualistic perception of\nthings appearing as environment, sense objects, and a body is the consciousness of the ground of all,\nwhich is accepted as existing substantially on the conventional level but is taught as being like a magical\nillusion and so on since it appears in a variety of ways while not existing dualistically. For this reason,\nbecause this tradition realizes, perfectly correctly, that the nondual consciousness is devoid of any truly\nexisting entities and of characteristics, the ultimate intentions of the charioteers of Madhyamaka and\nCittamātra should be considered as being in agreement… …So, if this so-called “self-illuminating nondual\nconsciousness” asserted by the Cittamātrins is understood to be a consciousness that is the ultimate of all\ndualistic consciousnesses, and it is merely that its subject and object are inexpressible, and if such a\nconsciousness is understood to be truly existent and not intrinsically empty, then it is something\nthat has to be refuted. If, on the other hand, that consciousness is understood to be unborn from the\nvery beginning (i.e. empty), to be directly experienced by reflexive awareness, and to be self-illuminating\ngnosis without subject or object, it is something to be established….”\n“To carry yourself forward\nand experience myriad things is delusion.\nThat myriad things come forth\nand experience themselves is awakening.”\n- Zen Master Dogen (Genjokoan)\n“The Buddha said, \"It is just the dharmas that combine to form this body. When it arises, it is simply the\ndharmas arising; when it ceases, it is simply the dharmas ceasing. When these dharmas arise, [the\nbodhisattva] does not state, 'I arise'; when these dharmas cease, he does not state, 'I cease'.\" \"In prior\nthought moments and subsequent thought moments, the moments do not relate to each other; in prior\ndharmas and subsequent dharmas, the dharmas do not oppose each other. This is called the ocean seal\nSamadhi.”\n- Zen Master Mazu Daoyi\n“The ultimate meaning means to be devoid of a person. The meaning of being devoid of a person is the\nineffable meaning. The ineffable meaning is the meaning of dependent arising. The meaning of\ndependent arising is the meaning of the Dharma. The meaning of the Dharma is the meaning of the\nTathāgata. Hence it is said, ‘One who sees dependent arising sees the Dharma; one who sees the Dharma\nsees the Tathāgata.’ And he sees in such a way that, when he searches, he does not see anything\nwhatsoever. In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what is anything whatsoever? It is the mind and the point of\nreference. When one does not see the mind and the point of reference, one then sees reality. In this way,\nthe Tathāgata has realized, through their very sameness, that all these dharmas are equal.

Any\nsūtrānta which teaches emptiness, the signless, the wishless, the unconditioned, the non-arisen,\nthe unproduced, the insubstantial, the non-existence of self, the non-existence of sentient beings,\nthe non-existence of living beings, the non-existence of individuals, the non-existence of an owner\nup to the doors of liberation, those are called \"definitive meaning\". This is taught in the sūtrāntas\nof of definitive meaning but is not taught in the sūtrāntas of the provisional meaning.'\nAlso, taken from Malcolm's Dharmawheel signature:\n[A]nything at all that is well spoken is the word of the Buddha.\n-- Ārya-adhyāśaya-sañcodana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra\nThe different sūtras in accord with the emptiness\ntaught by the Sugata are definitive in meaning;\nOne can understand that all of those Dharmas in\nwhich a sentient being, individual, or person are taught are provisional in meaning.\n-- Samadhirāja Sūtra\n\"Do not rely on the person, rely on the teaching, do not rely on the words, rely on the meaning, do not rely on\nthe provisional, rely on the definitive, do not rely on consciousness (vijñana), rely on primordial wisdom\n(jñana)\"\n-- Akshayamati-nirdesha sutra.\n“Kyle Dixon:\nlevel 3\nkrodha\n3 points · 2 years ago\nI thought that some of the sutras were by advanced practicioners those who became bodhisatvas after\nthe death of the Buddha.\nSure, but in Mahāyāna the \"Buddha\" is not relegated to the historical figure, Śākyamuni, and in fact the\nMahāyāna sūtras state that the \"Buddha\" should not be seen as name and form at all. Which means the\ndefinition of the Buddha is not limited to the historical figure.\n414\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nFor this reason \"buddhavacana\" or \"the word of the Buddha\" in Mahāyāna becomes whatever is \"said\nwell\", meaning an exposition that accords with the fundamental principles of karma, rebirth, dependent\norigination, bodhicitta, etc.\nThis is because the Buddha is not name and form, meaning the Buddha is not the rūpakāya, but rather\nthe Buddha is the nature of your mind, the dharmakāya.”\nAcarya Malcolm wrote in 2006:\n“Here, the Nirvana sutra clearly and precisely states that buddha-svabhaava, the \"nature of a Buddha\"\nrefers not to an actual nature but a potential. Why, it continues:\n\"Child of the lineage, I have said that ‘curd exists in milk’, because curd is produced from milk, it is called\n‘curd’.\nChild of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there is no butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the\ncurd arises from milk with the conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have the ‘curd-nature’.\"\nSo one must be quite careful not to make an error. The Lanka states unequivocably that the\ntathagatagarbha doctrine is merely a device to lead those who grasp at a true self the inner meaning of\nthe Dharma, non-arising, the two selflessnesses and so on, and explains the meaning of the literal\nexamples some people constantly err about:\n\"Similarly, that tathaagatagarbha taught in the suutras spoken by the Bhagavan, since the completely\npure luminous clear nature is completely pure from the beginning, possessing the thirty two marks, the\nBhagavan said it exists inside of the bodies of sentient beings.\nWhen the Bhagavan described that– like an extremely valuable jewel thoroughly wrapped in a soiled\ncloth, is thoroughly wrapped by cloth of the aggregates, aayatanas and elements, becoming impure by\nthe conceptuality of the thorough conceptuality suppressed by the passion, anger and ignorance – as\npermanent, stable and eternal, how is the Bhagavan’s teaching this as the tathaagatagarbha is not similar\nwith as the assertion of self of the non-Buddhists?\nBhagavan, the non-Buddhists make assertion a Self as “A permanent creator, without qualities, pervasive\nand imperishable”.\nThe Bhagavan replied:\n“Mahaamati, my teaching of tathaagatagarbha is not equivalent with the assertion of the Self of the non-\nBuddhists.\n415\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMahaamati, the Tathaagata, Arhat, Samyak Sambuddhas, having demonstrated the meaning of the words\n\"emptiness, reality limit, nirvana, non-arisen, signless\", etc. as tathaagatagarbha for the purpose of the\nimmature complete forsaking the perishable abodes, demonstrate the expertiential range of the non-\nappearing abode of complete non-conceptuality by demonstrating the door of tathaagatagarbha.\nMahaamati, a self should not be perceived as real by Bodhisattva Mahaasattvas enlightened in the future\nor presently.\nMahaamati, for example, a potter, makes one mass of atoms of clay into various kinds containers from\nhis hands, craft, a stick, thread and effort.\nMahaamati, similarly, although Tathaagatas avoid the nature of conceptual selflessness in dharmas, they\nalso appropriately demonstrate tathaagatagarbha or demonstrate emptiness by various kinds [of\ndemonstrations] possessing prajñaa and skillful means; like a potter, they demonstrate with various\nenumerations of words and letters. As such, because of that,\nMahaamati, the demonstration of Tathaagatagarbha is not similar with the Self demonstrated by the non-\nBuddhists.\nMahaamati, the Tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those grasping to assertions of the Self of the Non-\nBuddhists, will demonstrate tathaagatagarbha with the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha. How else will\nthe sentient beings who have fallen into a conceptual view of a True Self, possess the thought to abide in\nthe three liberations and quickly attain the complete manifestation of Buddha in unsurpassed perfect,\ncomplete enlightenment?\"\nThus, the Lanka says:\nAll yaanas are included\nin five dharmas, three natures,\neight consciousnesses,\nand two selflessnesses\nIt does not add anything about a true self and so on.\nIf one accepts that tathaagatagarbha is the aalayavij~naana, and one must since it is identified as such,\nthen one is accepting that it is conditioned and afflicted and evolves, thus the Lanka states:\nTathaagatagarbha, known as ‘the all-base consciousness’, is to be completely purified.\n416\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMahaamati, if what is called the all-base consciousness were (37/a) not connected to the\ntathaagatagarbha, because the tathaagatagarbha would not be ‘the all-base consciousness’, although it\nwould be not be engaged, it also would not evolve; Mahaamati, it is engaged by both the childish and\nAaryas, that also evolves.\nBecause great yogins, the ones not abandoning effort, abide with blissful conduct in this at the time of\npersonally knowing for themselves…the tathaagatagarbha-all basis consciousness is the sphere of the\nTathaagatas; it is the object which also is the sphere of teachers, [those] of detailed and learned\ninclinations like you, and Bodhisattva Mahaasattvas of analytic intellect.\nAnd:\nAlthough tathaagatagarbha\npossesses seven consciousnesses;\nalways engaged with dualistic apprehensions\n[it] will evolve with thorough understanding.\nIf one accepts that the tathaagatagarbha is unconditioned and so on, and one must, since it is identified\nas such other sutras state:\n\"`Saariputra, the element of sentient beings denotes the word tathaagatagarbha.\n`Saariputra, that word ‘tathaagatagarbha’ denotes Dharmakaaya.\nAnd:\n`Saariputra, because of that, also the element of sentient beings is not one thing and the Dharmakaaya\nanother; the element of sentient beings itself is Dharmakaaya; Dharmakaaya itself is the element of\nsentient beings.\nThen one cannot accept it as the aalayavij~naana-- or worse, one must somehow imagine that something\nconditioned somehow becomes conditioned.\nOther sutras state that tathaagatagarbha is the citta, as the Angulimaala suutra does here:\n\"Although in the `Sraavakayaana it is shown as ‘mind’, the meaning of the teaching is ‘tathaagatagarbha’;\nwhatever mind is naturally pure, that is called ‘tathaagatagarbha’.\nSo, one must understand that these sutras are provisional and definitive, each giving different accounts\nof the tathaagatagarbha for different students, but they are not defintive. Understood improperly, they\nlead one into a non-Buddhist extremes. Understood and explained properly, they lead those afraid of the\n417\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nprofound Praj~naapaaramitaa to understanding it's sublime truth. In other words, the Buddha nature\nteaching is just a skillful means as the Nirvana sutra states\n\"Child of the lineage, buddha-nature is like this; although the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses,\ncompassion, and the three foundations of mindfulness are the three aspects existing in sentient beings;\n[those] will be newly seen when defilements are thoroughly conquered. The possessors of perversion will\nnewly attain the ten powers (44/b) and four fearlessness, great compassion and three foundations of\nmindfulness having thoroughly conquered perversion.\nBecause that is the purpose as such, I teach buddha-nature always exists in all sentient beings.\nWhen one can compare and contrast all of these citations, and many more side by side, with the proper\nreading of the Uttataratantra, one will see the propositions about these doctrines by the Dark Zen fools\nand others of their ilk are dimmed like stars at noon.”\n............\nLankavatara Sutra then states:\n\"O Mahāmati, with a view to casting aside the heterodox theory, you must treat the tathāgatagarbha as\nnot self (anātman).”\nAnatman is taught not just in Mahayana sutras, but is also a central theme in the earliest canon,\nthe Pali canon, the basis of the Theravada tradition of Buddhism.\nBuddha in Yamaka Sutta:\nhttps://suttacentral.net/sn22.85/en/bodhi\n“What do you think, friend Yamaka, is form permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent,\nfriend.”…—“Therefore … Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’\n“What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form as the Tathagata?”—“No, friend.”—“Do you\nregard feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness as the Tathagata?”—“No,\nfriend.”\n“What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathagata as in form?”—“No, friend.”—“Do\nyou regard the Tathagata as apart from form?”—“No, friend.”—“Do you regard the Tathagata as in\nfeeling?

No, it doesn’t.\nThe mind has no existence apart from imputing such an existence upon the perpetuating aggregates\nand holding the belief in an ego, with the thought “I am!” Since the two kinds of self-entity are not\nseparate from that, neither can their existence be established when examined by correct discriminating\nknowledge.\nWhen there is a belief in an “I” or a “self” it follows that its existence cannot be ultimately established,\nbecause it neither differs from nor is identical with the five aggregates.\nIf, as in the first case, you could prove that there is a separately existing self, there would have to be a\n421\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nsixth aggregate of a substance different from the other five.\nSince such a knowable object is impossible, it would be like the name of the son of a barren woman. If\nthe self were identical [with the five aggregates], then it would have to be of identical substance and,\nsince the five aggregates have substantial existence while the belief in an “I” has imputed existence, their\nsubstances would be contradictory, like the concrete and inconcrete.\nAgain, to describe this in an easily understandable way: since the self cannot be observed as being some\nentity that is separate from the gathering of the five aggregates and also cannot be seen as being\nidentical with them, the existence of the self cannot be established. In the first instance, [it is impossible\nfor] the self to have any existence separate from the aggregates, because an additional sixth aggregate\nwould then have to exist, because ego-clinging applies to nothing other than the aggregates.\nMoreover, as no concrete thing exists separate from the characteristics of the aggregates and, as an\ninconcrete thing cannot perform a function, the self cannot be established as existing separate from\nthem.\nThough the self does not exist separately in that way, can’t its existence be established, as in the second\ncase, as identical with the aggregates? No, it cannot, because their characteristics are incompatible. In\nother words, all the aggregates are conditioned and therefore proven to be impermanent.\nThis is contrary to the self, which is held to be permanent, as in the case of assuming that one knows\nnow what one saw earlier. Furthermore, the aggregates are composed of categories with many divisions,\nsuch as forms, sensations, and so forth, while the self is believed to be singular, as in thinking “I am!”\nAnd finally, the aggregates verifiably depend on arising and perishing, while the self is obviously\nexperienced to be independent, as in the thought “I am!” The Prajnamula describes this:\nIf the self were the aggregates,\nThen it would arise and perish.\nBut, if the self is different from the aggregates,\nIt would have none of the aggregates’ characteristics.\nYou may now wonder, “Though the self does not exist, its continuity is permanent and can be proven to\nexist.” That is also not the case. The Two Truths says:\nThe so-called continuity or instant\nIs false, just like a chain, an army, and so forth.\nWhile in reality possessing not even the slightest existence, the self, the individual, and so forth, are\nmerely imputations made by the power of ego-clinging and are simply based upon the gathering of the\nfive perpetuating aggregates.\n422\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nEntering the Middle Way teaches:\nThe self does therefore not exist as something other than the aggregates,\nBecause it is not held as anything besides the aggregates.279\nAnd again, in the same text:\nWhen uttering such words as “the aggregates are the self,”\nIt refers to the gathering of the aggregates and not to their identity.\nThe word “chariot,” for instance, is merely a label given to the gathering of parts, such as the wheels and\nthe main beam of the chariot, while you find no basis for the characteristics of the chariot that is not the\nparts but the owner of the parts. In the same way, you cannot prove the basis for the so-called self\nbesides the mere belief that the ego is the gathering of the aggregates.\nThis is described in a sutra:\nJust as the name “chariot” is given to the gathering of all the parts,\nSimilarly, the name “sentient being” is superficially used for the aggregates.\nPadmasambhava - The Light of Wisdom VOLUME I - Rangjung Yeshe Publications”\n“In mustering the whole body and mind and seeing forms,\nin mustering the whole body and mind\nand hearing sounds,\nthey are intimately perceived;\nbut it is not like the reflection in a mirror,\nnor like the moon in the water.\nWhen one side is realized the other side is dark.”\n- Dogen (Genjokoan, commentary in Flowers Fall)\nAll Things Have One Nature, That Is, No Nature\nJohn Tan and I like this excerpt.\nJohn Tan:\n“I really like this article from Jay Garfield expressing \"emptiness of emptiness\" as:\n1.

Like the phases of insights in ATR\nthrough contemplating no-self (a negation), one directly and non-dually tastes the vivid appearances.”\nThe excerpt:\n“Now, since all things are empty, all things lack any ultimate nature, and this is a characterization of what\nthings are like from the ultimate perspective. Thus, ultimately, things are empty. But emptiness is, by\ndefinition, the lack of any essence or ultimate nature. Nature, or essence, is just what empty things are\nempty of. Hence, ultimately, things must lack emptiness. To be ultimately empty is, ultimately, to lack\nemptiness. In other words, emptiness is the nature of all things; by virtue of this they have no nature, not\neven emptiness. As Nagarjuna puts it in his autocommentary to the Vigrahavyavartanı, quoting lines from\nthe Astasahasrika-prajnaparamita-sutra: ‘‘All things have one nature, that is, no nature.’’\nNagarjuna’s enterprise is one of fundamental ontology, and the conclusion he comes to is that\nfundamental ontology is impossible. But that is a fundamentally ontological conclusion—and that is the\nparadox. There is no way that things are ultimately, not even that way. The Indo-Tibetan tradition,\nfollowing the Vimalakırtinirdesa-sutra, hence repeatedly advises one to learn to ‘‘tolerate the\ngroundlessness of things.’’ The emptiness of emptiness is the fact that not even emptiness exists\nultimately, that it is also dependent, conventional, nominal, and, in the end, that it is just the\neverydayness of the everyday. Penetrating to the depths of being, we find ourselves back on the surface\nof things, and so discover that there is nothing, after all, beneath these deceptive surfaces. Moreover,\nwhat is deceptive about them is simply the fact that we take there to be ontological depths lurking just\nbeneath.”\nJay Garfield & Graham Priest, in \"Nagarjuna and the limits of thought\"\n(Source of text: https://app.box.com/s/ne0b0wwismozwkftpe1h3tx4ew7mi9gn)\n[4:43 pm, 26/09/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Oh nice didnt know you posted\n[4:45 pm, 26/09/2021] John Tan: Yes so well expressed.

Notions or assertions suggesting that Zen is somehow mysterious, ineffable, or\ninexpressible are simply off the mark. The only place such terms can be accurately applied in Zen is to\ndefinite mysteries, particular unknowns, and specific inexpressible experiences. Indeed, in Zen, the terms\ndefinite, particular, and specific accurately characterize all dharmas. Dogen’s refrain, ‘Nothing in the\nwhole universe is concealed’ means exactly what it says; no reality is the least bit obscure or vague. To\nemphasize this truth, the assertion that ‘real form is all dharmas’ runs like a mantra throughout\nShobogenzo, for example:\n“The realization of the Buddhist patriarchs is perfectly realized real form. Real form is all dharmas.\nAll dharmas are forms as they are, natures as they are, body as it is, the mind as it is, the world as\nit is, clouds and rain as they are, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, as they are; sorrow\nand joy, movement and stillness, as they are; a staff and a whisk, as they are; a twirling flower and\na smiling face, as they are; succession of the Dharma and affirmation, as they are; learning in\npractice and pursuing the truth, as they are; the constancy of pines and the integrity of bamboos,\nas they are. Shobogenzo, Shoho-Jisso[199]” – Ted Biringer\n“It is extremely difficult to express what is ‘Isness’. Isness is awareness as forms. It is a pure sense of\npresence yet encompassing the ‘transparent concreteness’ of forms. There is a crystal clear sensations of\nawareness manifesting as the manifold of phenomenal existence. If we are vague in the experiencing of\nthis ‘transparent concreteness’ of Isness, it is always due to that ‘sense of self’ creating the sense of\ndivision… ...you must stress the ‘form’ part of awareness. It is the ‘forms’, it is the ‘things’.” - John Tan, 2007\n425\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“In light of Shobogenzo’s (hence Zen’s) vision of existence-time (uji), existence (ontology; being) and time\nare not-two (nondual); dharmas are not simply existents in time, they are existents of time, and (all) time\nis in and of existents (i.e. dharmas). In short, dharmas do not exist independent of time, and time does\nnot exist independent of dharmas. On a corollary note, since (all) existence demonstrates the quality of\n‘impermanence,’ time too is impermanent. In Zen the nonduality of impermanence and time is treated in\nterms of ‘ceaseless advance’ or ‘ever passing’ – ‘ceaseless’ and ‘ever’ connoting ‘permanence’ or ‘eternity,’\n‘advance’ and ‘passing’ indicating ‘impermanence’ or ‘temporal’ (temporary). Accordingly, ‘impermanence’\nis ‘permanent’ and ‘change’ is ‘changeless’ – existence-time ever-always (eternally) advances (changes).[92]\nDogen’s vision of reality exploits the significance of this to the utmost, unfolding its most profound\nimplications with his notion of ‘the self-obstruction of a single dharma’ or ‘the total exertion of a single\ndharma’ (ippo gujin). This notion reveals a number of important implications concerning the nature of\nexistence-time; two of which are: Each and all dharmas reveal, disclose, or present the whole universe\n(the totality of existence-time). Each and all dharmas are inherently infinite and eternal.” - Biringer, Ted.\nZen Cosmology: Dogen's Contribution to the Search for a New Worldview (p. 34). Kindle Edition.\n“Immediate Present, Ultimate Dharma\nSince our activity is not a progression from delusion to enlightenment made solely by the independent\nself, Dogen defines the first thought of practice as 'immediate present ultimate Dharma' or genjokoan:\nthe presence and perfection of all dharmas as they are in the here-and-now.' Hee-Jin Kim further explains\nthe meaning of genjokoan:\n'It does not suggest an evolutionary ascent from hidden-ness to manifestation, or from imperfection to\nperfection, or conversely, an emanational descent from one to many, or from reality to appearance.\nRather, things, events, beings are already unmistakably what they truly are; what is more, they are\nvibrant, transparent, and bright in their as-they-are-ness.'” - Zen teacher Shinshu Roberts\n“All Buddhas and all things cannot be reduced to a static entity or principle symbolized as one mind, one\nnature, or the like.

That is, regardless\nof any realization of no-self, and no matter how centerless one feels or how centerless is one's experience\nof awareness and so forth... still, anything short of direct realization of the radiance or luminosity as the\nvery stuff of transiency is still not what I call the realization of anatta.

Mountains, rivers, and the great earth are\nthemselves the mirror, not the reflections of a mirror.\n所以各位看到的、聽到的，你千萬不要以為是大圓鏡智所現，有一面法界法性的鏡子所現 的，隨你的因緣果報\n不同而現出的影子，這樣解說就完全錯掉了。看到、聽到、摸到、想到的通通都是鏡子，包括你自己，整個都是\n鏡子！這點不要誤會了。\nTherefore, do not think that whatever you see and hear are the manifestations of the Great Mirror\nWisdom, as if there is a universal mirror that is reflecting the reflections according to your causes and\nconditions/karma, such explanations are false. Whatever you see, hear, sense, think are entirely the\nmirror, including yourself - in their entirety they are all the mirror. Do not be mistaken on this point.” - Zen\nMaster Hong Wen Liang (洪文亮老師)\n“Every moment is an encounter of my thousand faces. The sound of thunder, every drop of rain,\nevery heartbeat, every breath, every thought. Experience, experience, experience, experience!”\n- Soh, 2012\n“I came to realize clearly that the mind is not other than mountains, rivers, the great wide earth, sun,\nmoon, stars”\n430\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n- Dogen\n“Mind as mountains, rivers, and the earth is nothing other than mountains, rivers, and the earth. There\nare no additional waves or surf, no wind or smoke. Mind as the sun, the moon, and the stars is nothing\nother than the sun, the moon, and the stars.”\n- Dogen\n“For Dōgen, Buddha-nature or Busshō (佛性) is the nature of reality and all Being. In the Shōbōgenzō,\nDōgen writes that “whole-being (Existence itself) is the Buddha-nature” and that even inanimate things\n(grass, trees, etc.) are an expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw Buddha-nature as a\npermanent, substantial inner self or ground. Dōgen held that Buddha-nature was “vast emptiness”, “the\nworld of becoming” and that “impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature”.[23] According to Dōgen:\nTherefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very\nimpermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains\nand rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete\nenlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.[24]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dōgen#Buddha-nature“\nJohn Tan, 2007:\n“Impermanence…\nThoughts, feelings and perceptions come and go; they are not ‘me’; they are transient in nature. Isn’t it\nclear that if I am aware of these passing thoughts, feelings and perceptions, then it proves some entity is\nimmutable and unchanging? This is a logical conclusion rather than experiential truth. The formless\nreality seems real and unchanging because of propensities (conditioning) and the power to recall a\nprevious experience and the experience of ‘impersonality’ may not be able to bring sufficient clarity to the\n‘impermanent and dynamic’ aspect of isness presence. The bliss and peace experienced here, is still the\nbliss of formlessness.\nThere is also another experience, this experience does not discard or disown the transients -- forms,\nthoughts, feelings and perceptions. It is the experience that thought thinks and sound hears. Thought\nknows not because there is a separate knower but because it is that which is known. It knows because it's\nit. It gives rise to the insight that isness never exists in an undifferentiated state but as transient\nmanifestation; each moment of manifestation is an entirely new reality, complete in its own. This brings\nabout the insight of non-duality but the experience of ‘impersonality need not necessarily arise.\nMy experience is fusing and stabilizing these 2 experiences are necessary to help further dissolve the ‘I’.\nWith the dropping of the 'I' , experience whole-heartedly and dropped the experience immediately; then\nnothing will imobilize the flow.\nPS: By the way, any idea what give rise to the sense of impersonality?”\n431\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Katagiri-Roshi said,\nThe important point is not to try to escape your life. But to face it- exactly and completely the way it is beyond\ndiscussion of good and bad, right and wrong, like and dislike. All you have to do is just take one step. Strickly\nspeaking, there is just one thing we have to face and nothing else (the temporal condition). If you believe there is\nsomething else besides this one thing, this is not pure practice. Just take one step in this moment with\nwholeheartedness.\nIn studying the fasicle Bussho, we find that Buddha-nature is not a thing that represents some kind of\nfoundation. Buddha-nature is impermanence and interconnectedness. It is essentially empty. Dogen\nbreaks down the “thingness” or solidness of all things by deconstructing time, space and body. He only\nwrites of the whole body or entire being, and the total functioning or interconnectedness of life. The\ntemporal conditions are the coming together of all the factors which produce the formation of this very\nmoment. That formation itself is Buddha-nature. - Zen teacher Judith Ragir,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2012/06/the-emancipation-of-suchness.html”\nGeovani Geo's insight shared in Awakening to Reality group:\n\"From another thread:\nSomeone wrote: \"If you see awareness as the untouchable ground of being then things can come and go\nwithin it but not have their own existence apart from awareness - but awareness can exist without them.\nIf on the other hand you see appearances as being modulations of awareness then there is a sense in\nwhich you could say that awareness is always 'modulating' in one way or another. So in this way of\nlooking there is always awareness and it always has some kind of appearance - because appearance is an\nessential aspect of being and to suggest that either being or appearance could exist separately would be\nincoherent.\"\nI think a got the whole thing now!! You see, above, you are still projecting \"things\" AND an \"awareness\".\nEven when you posit an awareness that modulates itself, there is still a notion that somehow there is an\nAwareness that is subtly different from things. Look at it. Why the need to talk about an Awareness that is\nOTHER than things, and that modulates itself? Only Awareness is!! The flow of ever changing things is\nwhat Awareness is!!!\nMany here have had this realization, but every now and then, because of the wrong view, such realization\nslips away and a background is questioned. There is no background AND a foreground. If you use the\nword god, then there is only god. NOT god AND his creation. The whole thing downed to me this morning.\nSee?\"\n\"When Soh says that he is not denying awareness, sounded strange to me. But considering the OP line of\ninquiry, it seems obvious that the \"awareness\" that soh is not denying is not some OTHER awareness\nseparate from things. But maybe he could have been clearer by explaining that the non-negated\nawareness he is referring to, is just another name for the flux of phenomena, or perhaps what \"buddha\nmind\" means. Certainly it is not some ongoing self-abiding ground awareness.\"\n432\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Geovani Geo wrote:\nWe hear a sound. The immediate deeply inbuilt conditioning says, \"hearing \". But there is a fallacy there.\nThere is only sound. Ultimately, no hearer and no hearing. The same with all other senses. A centralized,\nor expanded, or zero-dimensional inherent perceiver or aware-er is an illusion.\nThusness/John Tan:\nVery good.\nMeans both stanza is clear.\nIn hearing, no hearer.\nIn hearing, only sound. No hearing.”\n“The Stanza One complements and refines Stanza Two to make the experience of no-self thorough and\neffortless into just only chirping birds, drum beats, footsteps, sky, mountain, walking, chewing and tasting;\nno witness whatsoever hiding anywhere! 'Everything' is a process, event, manifestation and phenomenon,\nnothing ontological or having an essence.”\n- John Tan, 2009\n“By then it is clear that the transient phenomena is already happening in the perfect way; unwinding what\nmust be unwinded, manifesting what must be manifested and subsides when it is time to go. There is no\nproblem with this transient happening, the only problem is having an ‘extra mirror’, a reification due to\nthe power of the mind to abstract. The mirror is not perfect; it is the happening that is perfect. The mirror\nappears to be perfect only to a dualistic and inherent view.” - John Tan, 2009\n“For those masters that taught,\n“Let thoughts arise and subside,\nSee the background mirror as perfect and be unaffected.”\nWith all due respect, they have just “blah” something nice but deluded.\nRather,\nSee that there is no one behind thoughts.\nFirst, one thought then another thought.\nWith deepening insight it will later be revealed,\nAlways just this, One Thought!\nNon-arising, luminous yet empty!” - John Tan, 2009\n433\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“It is not only about recognizing the reflections as reflections, but also recognizing that there is no mirror\n(no mind)!” - Yogi Prabodha Jnana, teacher from the Dzogchen lineage. Also, for Dzogchen teachings, I like\nDzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith’s teachings as it is very much in line with anatta and emptiness:\nAcarya Malcolm on Dzogchen and Advaita Vedanta\nMany of the old Dzogchen masters like Mipam (read the book ‘Jamgon Mipam’ and ‘Mipham’s Beacon of\nClarity’), Longchenpa (see: The Philosophical Foundations of Classical rDzogs chen in Tibet: Investigating\nthe Distinction Between Dualistic Mind (sems) and Primordial knowing (ye shes)) and Padmasambhava\n(see: Self-Liberation through Seeing with Naked Awareness in English & Chinese) also clearly elucidated\nthe anatta insight.\nSome quotes from the link above ‘The Philosopical Foundations of…’: “To longchenpa self-awareness \"is\nsimply a vivid auto-manifestation, a process lacking any reality whatsoever\".\n...\nAccording to the viewpoint of this system, he says, all phenomena are self-luminous in the state of great\nprimordial knowing like light in the sky, having always been the very essence of this self-occuring\nprimorial knowing which remains naturally free from causes and conditions .263\n...\n[Longchenpa:]: \"It is eminently reasonable to claim that any objects that appear are unreal, but we refute\nthe claim that mind is ultimately real.\n….\n\"It is possible, Klong chen pa suggests, to simply recognize this nondual self occuring primordial knowing\nin its pristine nakedness (rjen pa sang nge ba) - both as it abides in its naked clarity and as it continuously\nmanifests as myriad objects - without hypostatizing it.273 For so long as \"one thinks of the abiding and\nmanifesting of cognition as two different things and talks about [the experience of] 'settling in the\nnonconceptual essence' [but also of] 'preserving the expressive energy as being free in its arising' , one's\npractice goes in two directions and one fails to understand the key point.\"\n“Kyle Dixon:\nIs primordial knowing a gloss of ye shes?\nI assume so\nDzogchen will even go as far as to say Buddhas do not even have ye shes\nSome Mahāyāna texts say this too\nBecause if they really had jñāna it could be misconstrued as a subjective reference point\n434\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nLongchenpa: From the [ultimate] perspective the meditative equipoise of the realised (sa thob) and\nawakened beings (sangs rgyas), there exists neither object of knowledge (shes bya) nor knowing cognitive\nprocess (shes byed) and so forth, for there is neither object to apprehend nor the subject that does the\napprehending. Even the exalted cognitive process (yeshes) as a subject ceases (zhi ba) to operate.”\nPhase 5 onwards are the crucial elements of the Buddhist form of enlightenment. It should be noted that\nit is possible to have peak experiences of no-mind (sense of a self temporarily dissolve, leaving merely the\nvivid colors/forms/sounds/sensations) but not having the direct realization of anatta as a dharma seal\n(characteristic of mind/phenomena/experience) as being always already so. This is similar to having a\nglimpse of recognition or experience of I AM and yet lacking direct realization of I AM as stated in Stage 1.\nA similar thing can happen for Stage 5, or Stage 6 - having glimpses of experiences similar to Stage 5 and 6,\nbut lacking the direct realization that is the defining criteria for having realized the insights of these phases.\n“No mind is an experience, it is not an insight. People that have experienced no-mind knows there is such\nexperience and aims towards achieving it again, but insight is different… it is a direct experiential realization\nthat all along it is so.” - John Tan, 2010\n“John: for you, you will not be clear now... what Richard taught has some problem...that focus is in the\nexperience. you should focus on the realization\nThe PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) is what I told you, bring what you experience into the foreground.\nRichard has a very important realization. that is, he is able to realize the immediate radiance in the\ntransience\nSoh: this is like your second point of anatta in the anatta article?\nJohn: yes. there is nothing to argue, it is obvious and clear. however I do not want to focus on the experience”\n- Conversation with John Tan, 2010, Actual Freedom and the Immediate Radiance in the Transience\nAugust 2010:\n“(11:07 PM) Thusness: for example you see AF description of insight and experience are very similar to\nwhat i described in anatta article.\n(11:11 PM) Thusness: there is no ending to this realization\n(11:42 PM) Thusness: Allow the muddy waters of mental activity to clear;\nRefrain from both positive and negative projection -\nleave appearances alone:\nThe phenomenal world, without addition or subtraction, is Mahamudra/liberation.\n435\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n-Tilopa\nthis is very good\n(11:46 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:51 PM) Thusness: ask how will what he realize thus far can lead to the insight that The phenomenal\nworld, without addition or subtraction, is Mahamudra/liberation.\nask luckystrikes\n(11:52 PM) AEN: ok posted\n(12:29 AM) AEN: Scott Kiloby: If you see that awareness is none other than everything, and that none of\nthose things are separate \"things\" at all, why even use the word awareness anymore?

A very important point here is that Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma Seal, it is the\nnature of Reality all the time -- and not merely as a state free from personality, ego or the ‘small self’ or a\nstage to attain. This means that it does not depend on the level of achievement of a practitioner to\nexperience anatta but Reality has always been Anatta and what is important here is the intuitive insight\ninto it as the nature, characteristic, of phenomenon (dharma seal).\nTo put further emphasis on the importance of this point, I would like to borrow from the Bahiya Sutta that\n‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing, there is just the heard, no hearer’ as an\nillustration. When a person says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a stage of\n‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and\nalways is only sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing attained for it is always\nso. This is the seal of no-self. Therefore to a non dualist, the practice is in understanding the illusionary\nviews of the sense of self and the split. Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, there will always be an\nunknowing attempt to maintain a purest state of 'presence'. This purest presence is the 'how' of a dualistic\nmind -- its dualistic attempt to provide a solution due to its lack of clarity of the spontaneous nature of the\nunconditioned. It is critical to note here that both the doubts/confusions/searches and the solutions that\n438\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nare created for these doubts/confusions/searches actually derive from the same cause -- our karmic\npropensities of ever seeing things dualistically.” - Soh\n“Direct Seal of Great Bliss\nThusness wrote in the comments section of the LuminousEmptiness blog in 2009:\nhttp://luminousemptiness.blogspot.com/2008/07/where-did-my-breath-go.html\nWhat expressed is truly wonderful!\nIt is so much to my liking that I have to say something.\nAlways only an assumption collating together and called 'something'.\nBe it breath, anger, fear or anything manifesting;\nAlways only sensations or heart beats or coldness or an arising thought of something.\nExactly like what Buddha taught in anatta,\nMerely aggregates and 18 dhatus playing;\nWith no agent anywhere found hiding.\nWhen experience matures in the practice of great ease,\nThe experience is maha!

From the perspective of awareness, there is no way to point to a moment of experience and\nsay this is ‘in’ and this is ‘out’. All ‘in’ are as ‘out’; to awareness seamless experience is all there is.\nYet in addition to this ‘ungraspability and unlocatabilty’ nature, emptiness is also about this maha sensation\nwhen a moment of luminous experience comes into being due to the inter-being and interdependency of\neverything as if the universe is doing the work and nothing ‘me’. When there is no sense of self, ‘Tong!’, the\nsound, the person, the stick, the bell, hitting, vibration of the air, ears...all come together as the moment of\nexperience called 'sound'. The universe is giving its very best for this moment of experience to arise.\nAlso when experience is seen as the manifestation of dependent origination, there is a sensation of always\nright wherever and whenever is. A sensation of home everywhere yet no place can be called home.\nJust a sharing.”\nAt Phase 5, one finally overcomes the view of eternalism (where one posits/views/perceives/experiences\nConsciousness/Awareness/Mind to be unchanging/eternal in contrast to other changing phenomena) that\nprevails the first four\nhttps://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=25540...\nAstus:\n\"To say that the mind is rattled and the nature is composed is the view of other ways; to say that the\nnature is clear and deep and the form shifts and moves is the view of other ways. The study of the mind\nand study of the nature on the way of the buddha are not like this. The practice of the mind and practice\nof the nature on the way of the buddha are not equivalent to the other ways. The clarification of the mind\nand the clarification of the nature on the way of the buddha, the other ways have no share in.\"\n(Dogen: Talking of the Mind, Talking of the Nature)\nDzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith:\nExcellent case in point.\n….\nZen Master Dogen wrote well about this:\nhttps://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/bendo.pdf\n441\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nHe may then respond, “There are some who say: Do not grieve over birth and death, since there is an extremely\nquick method for freeing yourself from them, namely, by understanding the principle that it is the innate nature\nof one’s mind to be ever-abiding, to persist without change. This means that, because this physical body has been\nborn, it will inevitably come to perish, but even so, this innate nature of the mind will never perish. When someone\nfully comprehends that the innate nature of his mind—which is never swept away by birth and death—is in his\nbody, he sees it to be his true and genuine nature. Thus, his body is but a temporary form, being born here and\ndying there, ever subject to change, whilst his mind is ever-abiding, so there is no reason to expect it to vary over\npast, present, and future. To understand the matter in this way is what is meant by being free from birth and\ndeath. For the one who understands this principle, his future births and deaths will come to an end, so that when\nhis body expires, he will enter the ocean of real existence. When he flows into this ocean of being, he will\nundoubtedly possess wonderful virtues, just as all the Buddhas and Tathagatas have done. Even though he may\nrealize this in his present life, he will not be exactly the same as those Holy Ones, since he has a bodily existence\nwhich was brought about through deluded actions in past lives. The person who does not yet understand this\nprinciple will be ever spun about through successive births and deaths. Therefore, we should just make haste and\nfully comprehend the principle of the innate nature of the mind being ever-abiding and persisting without change.\nTo pass one’s life just sitting around idly, what can be gained by that? Such a statement as this truly corresponds\nto the Way of all the Buddhas and all the Ancestors, don’t you think?”\nI would point out, “The view that you have just expressed is in no way Buddhism, but rather the non-Buddhist\nview of the Shrenikans.10 This erroneous view of theirs may be stated as follows:\nIn our bodies there is a soul-like intelligence. When this intelligence, or intellect, encounters conditions, it makes\ndistinctions between good and bad as well as discriminating right from wrong. It is conscious of what is painful\nor itches from desire, and is awake to what is hard to bear or easy. All such responses are within the capacity of\nthis intelligence. However, when this body of ours perishes, this soul-like nature sloughs it off and is reborn\nsomewhere else. As a result, even though it appears to perish in the here and now, it will have its rebirth in\nanother place, never perishing, but always abiding unchanged.\n“So this erroneous view goes. Be that as it may, your modeling yourself upon this view and regarding it as the\nBuddha’s Teaching is more foolish than clutching onto a roof tile or a pebble in the belief that it is gold or some\nprecious jewel. The shamefulness of such befuddled ignorance and delusion beggars comparison. National\nTeacher Echū in Great Sung China has strongly warned us about such a view. For you to now equate the\nwondrous Dharma of all the Buddhas with the mistaken notion that your mind will abide whilst your physical\nfeatures perish, and to imagine that the very thing which gives rise to the cause of birth and death has freed you\nfrom birth and death—is this not being foolish? And how deeply pitiable! Be aware that this is the mistaken view\nof one who is outside the Way, and do not lend an ear to it.\n(10.The Shrenikans were a group of non-Buddhists who are thought to have followed the teachings of Shrenika,\na contemporary of Shakyamuni Buddha. On occasion, they used terms similar to those in Buddhism, but with\ndifferent meanings.)\n442\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Because I now feel even greater pity for you, I cannot leave the matter here, but will try to rescue you from your\nerroneous view. You should understand that, in Buddhism, we have always spoken not only of body and mind\nas being inseparable, but also of the nature of something and the form it takes as not being two different things.\nAs this Teaching was likewise well known in both India and China, we dare not deviate from It. Even more, in\nBuddhist instruction that speaks of what is persistent, all things are said to have persistence without their ever\nbeing separated into categories of ‘body’ and ‘mind’.11\nIn instruction that talks about cessation, all things are said to be subject to cessation without differentiating\nwhether they are of some particular nature or have some particular form. So why do you risk contradicting the\ncorrect principle by saying that the body ceases whilst the mind permanently abides?\nNot only that, you must fully understand that ‘birth and death’ is nirvana: there has never been any talk of a\nnirvana outside of birth and death. Moreover, even though you may erroneously reckon that there is a Buddha\nWisdom that is separate from birth and death because you have worked it out that the mind permanently\nabides apart from the body, this ‘mind’ of yours—which understands, and works matters out, and perceives\nthings, and knows what they are—is still something that arises and disappears, and is in no way ‘ever-abiding’.\nSurely, this ‘mind’ of yours is something completely transitory! “You will see, if you give it a taste, that the\nprinciple of the oneness of body and mind is something constantly being talked about in Buddhism. So, how\ndoes the mind, on its own, apart from the body, keep from arising and disappearing as this body of yours arises\nand perishes?\nFurthermore, were they inseparable at one time and not inseparable at another, then what the Buddha said\nwould, naturally, be false and deceiving. “In addition, should you suddenly get the notion that eradicating birth\nand death is what the Dharma is really about, it would lead you to sullying the Precept against despising the\nBuddha Dharma. Do watch out for this! “\nYou must also understand that what is spoken of in the Buddha’s Teachings as ‘the Gate to the Teaching on the\nvast characteristics common to the nature of all minds’ takes in the whole universe, without dividing it into\ninnate natures and their forms or ever referring to things as ‘coming into existence’ or ‘perishing’.\nNothing, up to and including realizing enlightenment and nirvana, is excluded from the innate nature of your\nmind. Each and every thing throughout the whole of the universe is simply ‘the One Mind’ from which nothing\nwhatsoever is excluded. All Gates to the Teaching are equally of this One Mind. To assert that there are no\ndifferences whatsoever is the way the Buddhist family understands the nature of Mind. So, within this one all-\ninclusive Dharma, how can you separate body from mind or split ‘birth and death’ off from ‘nirvana’? You are\nalready a disciple of the Buddha, so do not give ear to the clatter of a lunatic’s tongue as he utters views that are\noff the True Track.”\n(11. Dōgen makes a distinction between the Buddhist concept of persistence and the Shrenikan concept of abiding.\nWith the former, all phenomena, physical and non-physical, arise and continue on (‘persist’) for an unspecified\nperiod before disintegrating and disappearing, whereas with the latter, the mind is thought to remain (‘abide’)\n443\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nunchanged and unchanging forever.)\n“Buddha-nature\nFor Dōgen, Buddha-nature or Busshō (佛性) is the nature of reality and all Being. In the Shōbōgenzō, Dōgen\nwrites that \"whole-being is the Buddha-nature\" and that even inanimate objects (rocks, sand, water) are\nan expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw Buddha-nature as a permanent,\nsubstantial inner self or ground. Dōgen held that Buddha-nature was \"vast emptiness\", \"the world of\nbecoming\" and that \"impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature\".[39] According to Dōgen:\nTherefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very\nimpermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains\nand rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete\nenlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.[40]”\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dgen\nFrom the Zen blue cliff records, on whether buddha nature is destroyed with the end of the world:\nDaizui's Kalpa Fire (30 of 100)\nMain Case\nAttention!

In a sense, he’s so stubborn and picky. Many Zen\ntexts agree with this theory in these sutras and Zongmi’s. Dogen is a very unusual and unique Zen master.\nTo be his student is a difficult thing.\" - Shohaku Okumura\n“And it is not just I that would openly criticise the views of these teachers and practitioners. Zen Master\nDogen was very open about criticizing his contemporary Zen masters that fall into such views. It was very\ncommon for Zen masters to get stuck at I AM and One Mind back then, as it is today. Zen Master Dogen\nwas a rare beacon of clarity, although of course there are some other Zen masters that were also clear. Zen\nMaster Dogen would not mince a word at critiquing his contemporaries or those who hold erroneous views,\nand would even use words that I would not use, like 'madmen' to describe holders of such view.\nTo point out how rare anatta and emptiness realisation is, I would also like to quote a passage from\n'Introduction to the Middle Way: Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with Commentary by Jamgon Mipham',\n\"There is a story that once when Atisha was in Tibet, he received news of the death of the master Maitripa.\nHe was deeply grieved, and on being questioned about the reasons for his sorrow, he replied that\nBuddhism was in decline in India and that everywhere there was syncretism and confusion. Until then,\nAtisha continued, there had been only two masters in the whole of India, Maitripa and himself, capable of\ndiscerning the correct teaching from the doctrines and practices of the reviving Hindu schools. The time is\nsure to come, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche commented, and perhaps it is already here, when there will be\nan analogous situation in the West. Only the correct establishment of the view will enable one to find one's\nway through the religious confusion of the modern West and to distinguish authentic Buddhism from the\nNew Age \"self-help\" versions that are already taking hold.”\n447\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nJust like it is rare today to find someone who is able to penetrate wrong views and distinguish between the\nviews of I AM/One Mind and anatta & emptiness, it was rare even in ancient times.\nPersonally, I just find myself so fortunate to have come to know John Tan, otherwise I will 100% be stuck at\nI AM like so many other practitioners and teachers. It is rare now, just like it was rare back in the days to\nhave someone with such clarity, to be able to distinguish clearly and have such deep comprehension.” -\nSoh, About whether XYZ teacher realised anatta, etc\nDo read: Teachers who Realised Anatta https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/02/teachers-who-\nrealised-anatta.html\nIf you find it is strange that there were only two masters in the whole of India that had realized anatta\nback then in the 11th century, a similar analogous situation is present today – I can only find two dharma\nteachers in the whole of India (a sub-continent with over 1 billion+ population) that is currently teaching\nfrom the experiential insight of anatman – the Dzogchen practitioners/teachers Prabodha Jnana Yogi*\nand Abhaya Devi Yogini. You’ll probably say, well, that’s to be expected because Buddhism largely died\nout in India, Hinduism being its current predominant religion, so of course the Atman view must be\nprevalent. However, I would also add that throughout China and Taiwan (where roughly 20% and 35%\nrespectively are Buddhists), another subcontinent with currently over 1+ billion people, I can only find two\ndharma teachers that teaches with the experiential insight into anatman – Zen Master Hong Wen Liang\n（洪文亮禅师）and Zen Master Hui Lu （慧律法师）(update: September 2020, found the third one: 继程法\n师. Upate 2021: sorry, 继程法师 doesn’t live in China but in Malaysia.). The others, as I found, mostly teach\nfrom the realization of I AM and one mind. I believe this is largely due to the gradual evolution of doctrinal\ninfluences over hundreds/thousands of years that made the Chinese Mahayana teaching gradually\ndeviate from the original doctrine of No-Mind/Anatman taught by the first Ch’an Patriarch Bodhidharma,\nas I discussed in Problem with Many Zen Teachings, and perhaps elucidated more clearly in scholastic\nbooks like How Buddhism Acquired a Soul on the Way to China (which I never read, but the synposis\nseems interesting). Interestingly, insight into anatman is somewhat more common in the west at the\nmoment. Realization of anatman is seemingly more common in Soto Zen (a Japanese Zen sect that was\nderived from the Chinese Cao Dong school of Ch’an Buddhism) perhaps due to the emphasis on the study\nof its founder Zen Master Dogen’s teachings, but I have known people who realize anatman in all the\nthree main Buddhist traditions – Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, and within Vajrayana I know of\nand can name people [currently alive] who realized anatta in basically all the subsects of Vajrayana, so I\nknow that this insight is fundamental to all Buddhist traditions without exception, although not always\ncommonly attained.\nArcaya Malcolm said in 2020, “While there are problems with Sino-Japanese concepts of self, as eloquently\nillustrated by the late Jungnok Park in his How Buddhism Acquired a Soul on the Way to China, the idea of all\nphenomena possessing buddhanature that we see frequently mentioned in Sino-Japanese Buddhism is\nnot a problematic at all, if understood as Nāgārjuna states it in the MMK, \"Whatever is the nature of the\n448\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nTathāgata, that is the nature of the world.

It should however be noted that in Theravada,\nNibbana/Nirvana can be achieved in this very life-time while one is still alive and breathing - it is the\ncessation of passion, aggression and delusion, and all manners of clinging and the proliferation of ‘I am’.\nFurthermore, the early scriptures of the Pāli Canon rejects all types of eternalist doctrines, as the Buddha\nwas very adamant in rejecting all types of views that are eternalist or nihilist. For example, in the Brahmajala\nsuttas (among many other suttas) the Buddha spelt out and rejected the eternalist view that posits mind\nor consciousness to be changeless:\n“49. \"In the fourth case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honorable recluses and brahmins\neternalists in regard to some things and non-eternalists in regard to other things, proclaiming the self and the\nworld to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal?\n\"Herein, bhikkhus, recluse or a certain brahmin is a rationalist, an investigator. He declares his view — hammered\nout by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought — thus: 'That which is called\n\"the eye,\" \"the ear,\" \"the nose,\" \"the tongue,\" and \"the body\" — that self is impermanent, unstable, non-eternal,\nsubject to change. But that which is called \"mind\" (citta) or \"mentality\" (mano) or \"consciousness\" (viññāṇa) —\nthat self is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and it will remain the same just like eternity itself.'\n\"This, bhikkhus, is the fourth case. - https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html\n449\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAlso, dependent origination is taught as the middle way free from extremes of eternalism and nihilism in\nthe the early scriptures of the Pāli Canon. The Buddha explained (SN 12:17):\n“[If one thinks,] “The one who acts is the same as the one who experiences [the result],” [then one asserts] with\nreference to one existing from the beginning, “Dukkha is created by oneself.” When one asserts thus, this amounts\nto eternalism.\nBut Kassapa, [if one thinks,] “The one who acts is one, the one who experiences [the result] is another,” [then one\nasserts] with reference to one stricken by feeling: “Dukkha is created by another.” When one asserts thus, this\namounts to annihilation.\nWithout veering toward either of these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: “With\nignorance as condition, formative actions [arise]: [the remainder of the twelve links are listed, with each\nconditioning the arising of the next.]...Such is the origin of this whole mass of dukkha. But with the remainderless\nfading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of formative actions…[the rest of the links]. Such as the\ncessation of the whole mass of dukkha.”\nIt is also important to understand that the realisation of anatta is not just understanding everything to be\nimpermanent and momentary, and hence, not self. Many people understand anatta/no-self that way.\nHowever, as John Tan said before, that is merely an inferential understanding and not a direct realization.\nMost Buddhists only understand anatta (if they have any understanding at all) inferentially, through logical\ndeductions like that, or even a partially deduced understanding based on some glimpses of the momentary\nnature of all experiences in meditation which led to a mental conclusion that what is impermanent does\nnot belong to a self, but all these partially or fully inferentially-deduced understandings are far from the\nyogic and direct realization, taste and actualization of anatta as in the case of John Tan Stage 5.\n“Understand no background first, no container - all those that I told you. What is the true meaning of no-\nself. There are those that talk a lot about no-self, but there is no correct understanding. [One attempts to\nunderstand anatta inferentially and] just say change, no permanent self, and so on and so forth, but there\nis no true understanding. Like when you begin, what is no-self to you? It is always no inherent existence,\nimpermanence, this and that. Get it? There is no real understanding. There is thinking, no thinker. What\ndoes this mean? So now you know. There is no background, then you practice insight meditation -\nknowledge, practice then realisation. There is correct knowledge, but there is no quality practice therefore\nthe realisation isn't there yet, and then comes the intensity of realisation. Opening of wisdom eye is just a\nshift of perception. It is just like you know how to enter a pathless path, and can experience clarity\nimmediately. But then even after non dual, you must go through a period of stabilizing first.” - John Tan,\n2007\nFurthermore, if one has certain insights and experiences into no-self but has not given rise to the realisation\nof ‘no background’ and ‘no agent’ leading to effortless non-dual luminosity, that is still not the phase 5 type\n450\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nof realization of anatta but a more minor aspect of no-self experience such as impersonality and non-\ndoership. You can have those insights even at the I AM phase or even before the I AM phase, while\nexperience still remains dualistic most of the time (experience remains split into a subject and object, a\nWitness/observer and a witnessed/observed).\nIt is also important to understand that this realisation of non-dual anatta is crucial to all vehicles/traditions\nof Buddhism (even though the majority of current practitioners and teachers may not have attained these\nrealisations themselves). I noticed many teachers in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism are making a\nstraw man out of so called ‘Hinayana Buddhism’, hence I (Soh) wrote in\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/11/problem-with-many-zen-teachings.html, “...Basically, this\nVenerable (and many other teachers) make the mistake of attributing Hinayana to I AMness level of formless\nrealisation, and Mahayana to One Mind where the Substance can produce infinite functions and is nondual with\nits functions. They get stuck between Thusness Stage 1 to 4. They didn't realise that 'Hinayana'/Theravada teachers\nlike Daniel M. Ingram can have an effortless, constant nondual experience of 'Bamboos are dharmakaya' WITH\nRight View and realization of anatta which makes nondual even more effortless. Other Theravadin\nmasters/teachers/practitioners who realized non-dual anatta insights include but are not limited to Ajahn Amaro\n(See: The Breakthrough), (Phra) Kovit Khemananda, and so on. Hence, the notion that Theravada leads only to\n'Causal/Formless/I AM' realization and do not have access to non-dual insights is unequivocally false. As Thusness\nalso pointed out in the past, and anyone with any semblance of familiarity with the Pali Suttas (the original\nteachings of Buddha) will know, anyone who held any ideas about Consciousness as Self, or as a\nSource/Substratum of phenomena will get heavily admonished by the Buddha as holding wrong views (see: MN38\nand MN1). We can thus know that Thusness Stage 5~6 is really where the true insight into Buddhadharma 'begins',\nand while Thusness Stage 1~4 may be enlightenment in non-Buddhist religions, they are not considered to be\neven entering the gate or 'stream-entry'/'first bhumi' in Buddhadharma.\nThe Venerable didn't realise that the 'Hinayana sutta', Bahiya Sutta, is clearly not only non-dual but in fact taught\nthe peak of non-dual experience, with right view, and Bahiya attained arahantship instantly upon hearing Buddha\nspeak of that teaching. Bahiya Sutta, Kalaka Sutta, and many other suttas are all about this. Without the direct\nrealisation of right view (anatta, dependent origination, emptiness), whatever nondual realisations cannot be\nconsidered Buddhadharma, even at the Hinayana level, let alone Mahayana which further elaborates on the\ndirect realisation of the non-arising of all phenomena that are dependently designated/dependently originated...”\nand John Tan also said many times, for example in 2008, that “There is no point arguing. There can be no\ntrue understanding of Buddha's teachings without non-dual insight.” -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/03/mindfulness-as-remembrance.html\nEven though Vipassana is commonly taught in many Theravadin dharma centers, the key towards luminous\nmanifestation and non-dual anatta is often not taught, a point John Tan made years ago (see: 'Vipassana\nMust Go With Luminous Manifestation' https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/vipassana-must-\ngo-with-luminous.html). Although it should also be mentioned that not all Mahayana/Vajrayana teachers\n451\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nmake the same criticisms, as some would relegate the realization of an arahant to a higher level or even be\non par with a sixth or eighth bhumi bodhisattva, the views vary according to schools and teachers.\nThe Mahayana and Vajrayana teachers’ often-made criticisms that the Theravadins/early traditions do not\ngrasp the truth of non-duality (i.e. The non-duality of subject and object, Mind and phenomena, etc) isn’t\nhelped by the fact that most teachers and practitioners in the Theravada tradition themselves did not truly\nrealize non-dual anatta, and may instead be prone towards dissociation and equanimity, although there\nare also clearly those who do realize non-dual anatta in the Theravada tradition. That is not to say that the\nsituation in Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions nowadays are much better, as I have seen too many\nteachers and masters from those traditions who are also stuck at the I AM and One Mind level, holding\neternalistic views no different from Advaita Vedanta. This statement is not made to belittle or denigrate\nAdvaita Vedanta which I have much respect for, but it would be a pity that the true essence, import and\nliberative potential of Buddhadharma (teachings of Buddha) continues to be missed and misinterpreted by\nthese teachers and communities.\nAs a general trend, however, I find that Soto Zen masters/teachers/communities tend to produce more\npractitioners that realise anatta. This is due to the deep clarity of anatman in the writings of their school’s\nfounder, Zen Master Dogen.\nAs John Tan said in 2007 about Dogen, “Dogen is a great Zen master that has penetrated deeply into a very\ndeep level of anatman.”, “Read about Dogen… he is truly a great Zen master… ...[Dogen is] one of the very\nfew Zen Masters that truly knows.”, “Whenever we read the most basic teachings of Buddha, it is most\nprofound. Don't ever say we understand it. Especially when it comes to Dependent Origination, which is\nthe most profound truth in Buddhism*. Never say that we understand it or have experienced it. Even after\na few years of experience in non-duality, we can't understand it. The one great Zen master that came closest\nto it is Dogen, that sees temporality as buddha nature, that see transients as living truth of dharma and the\nfull manifestation of buddha nature.”\n\"When you ride in a boat and watch the shore, you might assume that the shore is moving. But when you\nkeep your eyes closely on the boat, you can see that the boat moves. Similarly, if you examine many\nthings with a confused mind, you might suppose that your mind and nature are permanent. But when\nyou practice intimately and return to where you are, it will be clear that there is nothing that has\nunchanging self.\n- Dogen\"\n*Was reminded of this quote from the suttas, “I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living\namong the Kurus. Now, the Kurus have a town named Kammāsadhamma. There Ven. Ānanda approached the\nBlessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the\nBlessed One: “It’s amazing, lord, it’s astounding, how deep this dependent co-arising is, and how deep its\nappearance, and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be.”\n452\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(The Buddha:) “Don’t say that, Ānanda. Don’t say that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance.\nIt’s because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a\nknotted ball of string, like matted rushes and reeds, and does not go beyond transmigration, beyond the planes\nof deprivation, woe, & bad destinations.” - Mahā Nidāna Sutta,\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN15.html\nAs for Tibetan Buddhism, there are also many Mahamudra texts of old that suggests deep insight into\nanatman/anatta and emptiness.\nJohn Tan also said in 2008, “(11:34 PM) Thusness: When a practitioner see anatta and insight arise, he\nsees non-dual directly and naturally. However when we see Element, he can't see it and said that the\nBuddha did not teach about non-dual, how amazing. And many Theravada masters [Soh: many Theravada\nmasters also have the misunderstanding that anatta is not non-dual, many Theravada masters like from the Thai\nforest tradition fall into a dualistic and eternalistic Witness or an ultimate and changeless Mind while dissociating\nfrom the aggregates as not self, making them no different from Advaita Vedanta, and even if they do not hold\neternalistic views they usually do not have experiential realization of anatta, which is to say that their\nunderstanding of anatta remains inferential or intellectual or surface-level]. Buddhism is going through a period\nof great distortion. Even the most clearest teachings can be distorted, one vehicle against another. Just\npractice hard and have direct experience so that prajna wisdom may arise in you, for you to correctly\ndiscern the truth and the path towards liberation.”\nWe cannot completely blame the Mahayana and Vajrayana teachers for denigrating or underestimating the\nrealizations of the Theravada tradition, because these Mahayana and Vajrayana teachers come from a\ntradition that has lost touch and communication with Theravada Buddhism (also called ‘Hinayana’ in a more\nderogatory convention of Mahayana-speak) for centuries or millenniums. For example, it may be difficult\nfor a Tibetan lama who lived in Tibet to speak with a Theravadin meditation master that lived in Sri Lanka,\nor a Zen master that lived in Japan. However, today we live in a time of unprecedented technological\nbreakthroughs that allow the teachers and practitioners of many traditions to co-exist at the same place,\nand that alone should encourage and foster more cross-traditional dialogues, or at least online\nconversations, and provide for access to recorded materials of other traditions online and in libraries.\nHence, dharma teachers ought to look outside of their own little bubble and not make faulty or grossly\ninaccurate assumptions about what kind of realisations and experiences the other traditions are capable\nof ‘producing’, before making unfair and inaccurate criticisms about other traditions. The same applies to\nanything else - it is not that we cannot or should not make criticisms of others (sometimes, it can be\nbeneficial). However, for whatever claims and criticisms we make of others or of ourselves, we need to\nmake sure that they are consistent with facts and actuality. Otherwise, it will simply not stand the scrutiny\nof the vast reservoir of information that people can access in this modern day and age, and by making\ninaccurate assumptions and assertions, your own credibility will be at stake.\n453\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nI have posted a lot of quotations from the Buddha from the Pali Canon, Theravada, Mahayana and\nVajrayana sources about anatta in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2011/10/anatta-not-self-or-no-\nself_1.html - and it contains many crucial points about the view and practice of anatta. You will see that on\nthe point of anatta, the fundamental teachings of all Buddhist traditions have a lot to agree on.\nThere is no need to buy into a particular set of dogma or get fixated on any particular tradition in order to\nrealize anatta. Realizing anatta is a birthright of anyone, it only requires earnest and sincere contemplation\nin direct experience. Here’s an experiential account from Joel Agee:\nExcerpt from Joel Agee: Appearances are Self-Illuminating\n“I will try to describe what it is that rings true for me in Thusness’s words. I don’t have a theoretical preference for\nthe early Buddhist teachings over the later ones, including Dzogchen. In fact I know very little about the Pali Canon.\nMy approach isn’t conceptual or theoretical at all. I look directly into the nature of my own consciousness in silent,\nobjectless sitting meditation – shikantaza if you will. Whatever doesn’t meet the test of direct experience holds no\nlasting interest for me.\nUntil fairly recently, the metaphor of the mirror and its reflections seemed a fitting image of my contemplative\nexperience: that there is an unchanging, ever-present, imperturbable awareness that is the absolute ground and\nthe very substance of phenomena, and that while this motionless, contentless awareness-presence is inseparable\nfrom the ceaseless coming and going of appearances, it also transcends everything that shows up, remaining\nuntouched, unstained, absolute and indestructible.\nA couple of years ago I discovered Soh’s blog, Awakening to Reality, and in it Soh’s account of his exploration of\nthe Bahiya Sutta and the Zen Priest Alex Weith’s report on his realization of Anatta through practical application\nof the Bahiya Sutta. I saw then that Anatta was not fully realized in my experience. The illusory nature of a separate\nunchanging personal self had been seen through, but an unconscious identification with “Awareness” or “rigpa”\nhad taken its place.\nSince then, an unstoppable deconstruction of that impersonal background identity has been happening in my\ncontemplation and in my daily life. There is still a noticeable attachment to the memory of that subtle Home Base.\nIt shows up as a tendency to \"lean back\" from the unpredictable brilliance and dynamism of the moment into a\nstatic, subtly blissful background presence. But there is no longer a belief in an Awareness that is anything other\nthan, or greater than, or deeper than, THIS sound, THIS smile or stirring of emotion, THIS glance of light. There is\nno Mirror that is not the reflections.\nSo the shift in my experience and practice is not a preference for one teaching over another. It’s an ongoing\nrealization that direct contact with the grain and texture of moment-by-moment experience is what Dogen meant\nby “being awakened by the ten thousand things.”\n454\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nDifference Between John Tan Stage 4 and John Tan Stage 5\nWhat are the main distinguishing factors between John Tan Stage 4 and Stage 5? The following\nconversations may shed some light.\n2010:\n“(11:51 PM) Thusness: non-dual and anatta is a matter of degree of clarity of what?\n(11:52 PM) AEN: of awareness? of the transience\n(11:52 PM) Thusness: of the relationship between awareness and transience. is truly existing behind\nreality somehow having a 'non-dual' experience. one is realizing that awareness is a DO manifestation\n(11:55 PM) AEN: icic..\n(12:02 AM) Thusness: it is the degree of clarity if the relationship between awareness and transience.\n(12:04 AM) Thusness: why don't you just say 'between anatta and non-dual, it is just the degree and depth\nof clarity between Awareness and the Transience'\n(12:19 AM) Thusness: only and purely aggregates, only the 18 dhatus, 'only the world referencing itself'.\nThe tendency to reference back to a 'Self/self' is replaced by the thorough insight of anatta and DO.””\n“Session Start: Saturday, March 14, 2009\n(11:52 PM) AEN: icic.. btw wats the difference between stage 4 and 5 other than stabilizing non dual\n(11:54 PM) Thusness: you need to face the problem to know,\nit is not in words. because you have not experienced non-division, so you do not know what is non division,\nwhat is no-doership and what is no agent in experience, and it is difficult to know what is that 'marks' that\nprevent the experience of spontaneity. there is a difference seeing thinker/thoughts as one and\nhearer/sound as one…. then sound is awareness, no hearer. stage 4 is more like hearer/sound as one, that\nis why I said one thought, then another thought. just like you, you said you feel like an open space. then\nyou hear sound, sound and awareness seem to be one. indistinguishable but you cannot have that\nexperience that there is only sound. only in logic you have but not in experience. until one day you mature\nthat experience\n(12:01 AM) AEN: icic.. just now I saw a website from truthz's blog link\n(12:02 AM) AEN: http://buddhaspace.blogspot.com/\nCorrect Understanding - the first of the eight aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path - arises out of noticing the\nimpermanent, unsatisfactory, and impersonal nature of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects.\nWhen all these phenomena are realized to be not self, the mind will turn inwards, seeking out what it might\ncling to as ‘me’. But if it looks with absolute clarity it will find emptiness. Behind sensations, feelings,\nthoughts, and consciousness, there lies clear, endless space. I sometimes call it ‘Buddha Space’.\n(12:05 AM) Thusness: yeah, that is wrong view. it is very difficult to see the truth of this until our insight\nmatures. even at stage 4, it can be difficult but it is already the first steps towards anatta\n(12:06 AM) AEN: difficult to what, see anatta?\n455\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(12:06 AM) Thusness: yeah. you must see the no agent, not only no division. like I told you there are 3\nstages. later into just this non-dual luminosity. if you ask non-dualists, they will not realise that they are an\narising thought like what jeff foster said. they will feel damn ultimate\n(12:10 AM) AEN: ic.. like brahman\n(12:11 AM) Thusness: yes so they see self. not events, process phenomena\n(12:12 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:12 AM) Thusness: they see brahman, not sunyata. Even [when] the experiences are very similar, the\ninsight has not matured into anatta. like shingon sort of practice, the experience can be said to be maha\nlike, but it is not the maha sort of experience I am talking about. it is oneness sort of experience, but it is a\nstage. what I said is oneness is always there when one realises that presence is always a manifestation and\nfull embodiment of interconnectedness no effort needs to be done to induce a maha experience”\n“Yes not to be fixated but also not to objectify the “spaciousness” otherwise “spaciousness” is no less fixated.\nThe ‘space’ appears appealing only to a mind that abstracts but to a fully participating and involving mind,\nsuch “spaciousness” has immediately sets itself apart, distancing itself from inseparable. Emptiness is\nnever a behind background but a fully partaking foreground manifesting as the arising and passing\nphenomena absence of a center. Therefore understand ‘spaciousness’ not like sky but like passing clouds\nand flowing water, manifesting whenever condition is. If ‘Emptiness’ has made us more fixated and\nimmobilized this innate freedom of our non-dual luminosity, then it is ‘stubborn emptiness’.\nNevertheless, no matter what said, it is always inadequate. If we want to fully realize the inexpressible, be\nwilling to give up all centers and point of references that manifests in the form of ‘who’, ‘when’ and ‘where’.\nJust give up the entire sense of self then instantly all things are spontaneously perfected.” - John Tan, 2009\nAlso, as John and Soh later pointed out, the quality of spaciousness is important even in Stage 5 but is\nexperienced and realized to be a fully participating foreground and total exertion of a boundless and\nimmense universe, with no trace of spaciousness being reified as an ultimate background or even a\ncontainer subsuming all else as ‘mere contents of the Absolute’ (see: One Mind). Hence John’s advise, to be\n“as light as a feather, as immense as the universe”, the lightness being the energetic quality of total mind-\nbody relaxation and release from self in all aspects, and not overly contrived and overfocused with an\nobsessive intent to experience more, but a natural and spontaneous presencing of the manifold. In short,\nwithout contrived overfocus, there is a natural spaciousness that is the immensity of the luminous and\nboundless world in total exertion, not in anyway absolutized and aggrandised into a metaphysical\nsubstratum.\n…\n7/9/2012 11:23 PM: John: For anatta, opening will be realized as action...this manifestation. But for those\nthat practice non-dual awareness, they always trace back to the source. For anatta, there is no source to\ntrace, it is fully manifested as the immediate moment of manifestation or as this flow of action\n456\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n…\n2008:\n(11:46 PM) Thusness: Does ken (Ken Wilber) talk about anatta\n(11:46 PM) AEN: no\n(11:47 PM) Thusness: Or Advaita sort of understanding\n(11:47 PM) AEN: advaita (Ken Wilber is at Thusness Stage 4)\n(11:47 PM) Thusness: Then why you kept asking me. What is anatta?\n(11:48 PM) AEN: ya but wat I mean is nondual experience is not as in stage 2 type of passing experience,\nbut as everpresent reality?\n(11:48 PM) AEN: anatta is no agent and dependent origination?\n(11:48 PM) Thusness: Didn't I tell you understanding non-dual experience as verb. (Soh: refer to my\narticle The Wind is Blowing, Blowing is the Wind)\n(11:49 PM) Thusness: Not an entity that is independent and unchanging?\n(11:49 PM) AEN: but ken wilber say \"You are that, and there is no you – just this entire luminous display\nspontaneously arising moment to moment. The separate self is nowhere to be found.\"\n(11:50 PM) Thusness: Non-dual experience is there is clarity of no separation (As in Thusness Stage 4).\nStage 2 is there is merging. As if I dissolved and merge..\n(11:52 PM) Thusness: There are two, dual [in stage 2]. Non-dual [stage 4] is [that] there never was a\nseparation. No split. There is no separate I. But this awareness is still very much constant, permanent and\nunchanging. Anatta goes further and understand exactly what is non-dual experience. This is a break-\nthrough in insight. There is thinking, no thinker. Seen no seer. Sound no hearer. Understood becoming no\nbeing. Understand that Object/subject is the result of compartmentizing 'verb', Action - Thinking becomes\nthinker and thoughts. That is anatta. It is the direct experience that there is no thinker, just thoughts. In\nseeing, always only the seen.\n(12:01 AM) AEN: is this what you mean by nondual yet permanent (for ken wilber):\nYou are not the one who experiences liberation; you are the clearing, the opening, the emptiness, in which\nany experience comes and goes, like reflections on the mirror. And you are the mirror, the mirror mind,\nand not any experienced reflection. But you are not apart from the reflections, standing back and watching.\nYou are everything that is arising moment to moment. You can swallow the whole cosmos in one gulp, it is\nso small, and you can taste the sky without moving an inch.\n(12:03 AM) Thusness: Yes what I called the desync of view and non-dual experience. When insight\narises, there is no desync. Non-dual experience is clearly understood because there never was a self. It is\nalways only manifestation. DO [dependent origination] is the operational mechanism of the Transience. It\nis very difficult to have such clarity. Only Buddha has it. Even buddhist practitioners have so much mis-\nconceptions. They can't see how consistent and precise the teaching is\n(12:14 AM) AEN: btw this is not yet nondual experience rite, more like I AM?:\n457\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(12:14 AM) AEN: \"the world moves forward as it is..... but instead of seeing the diversity as the ulitmate\nthe One underneath it all is rested in..... Like the ocean reality or maya is simply the surface waves of moving\nconsciousness.... shakti which manifests the underlying Ocean of Consciousness into a limited visible\nform..... But what is beneath and around and within that form is simply the same consciousness which\ncomprises the Whole of the Ocean.... But in the calm of the depths you know the vastness instead of the\nlimited......\"\n(12:16 AM) Thusness: Yes. Under the influence of the 'bond' without knowing it. Stage 1 to 6 cannot\nbe skipped. Best experienced that way. A practitioner cannot skip stages\n(12:18 AM) AEN: but buddhist path skips some rite. like dharma dan never go through 'i am'\n(12:18 AM) Thusness: Yes. the depth of clarity will not be there. Like grimnexus see 4 same as 5. But\na person that undergone knows clearly.\n(12:21 AM) AEN: oic.. ya he thought its the same. btw grimnexus at stage 4 rite\n(12:21 AM) Thusness: Like ken and Ajahn amaro, seems the same but even Ajahn Amaro thought it\nis the same.\n(12:21 AM) AEN: oic\n(12:21 AM) Thusness: Why do you worry so much about other people's stage?\n(12:22 AM) AEN: lol\n(12:23 AM) Thusness: Rather pray hard that you will not be misled and go through countless lives of\nrebirth again. What you must have is to correctly discern. If you want to have clarity of the essence of the\nsix phases, discern and understand correctly. What if I am no more around? If Ajahn Amaro cannot know\nthe difference, much less are the others. Rather ask yourself have you correctly understood then about\nothers. How do I know? You kept asking about others, I worry more about you. If you know, you will be able\nto know are they there. Like Ken [Wilber] and Ajahn Amaro clearly have the same experience but different\nunderstanding. David Loy treats them the same too. Not realizing the differences. So have the right\nunderstanding. One is abiding, the other is non-abiding. One is still efforting, the other is effortless. One is\nBrahman, the other is DO [dependent origination]. One is mirror, the other is pure manifestation. 'Self' is\ngrasped unknowingly because it is independent, changeless. Therefore they can't treasure the Transience.\nThey can't see conditions. The Transience and conditions are most sacred. How can Self see this? But one\nmust know the emptiness nature of Transience, unfindable and ungraspable. And rises when condition is.\nWhen we say attributes, we are referring to the empty nature of awareness. But awareness is full of colors.\nLike 'redness' of a flower. But to advaitins, it is absence. Nothing to do with awareness\n(12:43 AM) AEN: u mean they see awareness as formless?\n(12:43 AM) Thusness: yes. Means absence of attributes as colorless, formless. But what buddhism is\nreferring is its emptiness nature. Not that there is a real formless entity. Awareness is appearances\nappearing when condition is. awareness is not free of thoughts. To advaitins, it is. To buddhist practitioner,\nthought is awareness. One thought arises, Next one. Like what Ajahn Amaro said. There is no worry about\nno thought, no conceptuality. All will be experienced in their most vivid forms.\n458\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nTwo Stanzas of Anatta and the Metaphors and Practices that Trigger Experiential Insight\nBefore reading this chapter, make sure to read the article On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and\nOrdinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection by John Tan. Consider this section a summary and additional\ncommentary for the original article. When both stanzas of anatta are completely realized as always already\nso, that is John Tan Stage 5.\n“To me anatta stanza is still the best trigger… lol. It allows us to clearly see anatta is the natural state. Always\nis and effortlessly so. It shows \"how ignorance\" blinds and creates misconceptions of separation and\nsubstantiality of what we called \"things and phenomena\".\nAnd realising the view is all pointing to this truth of anatta from top to bottom of how the mind confuses\nand mistakens conventional existence as true and real. Dependent origination and emptiness are the raft\nto balance and neutralize all mind-made conventionalities, so that the mind can rest in natural ease and\nbalance, seeing all arising as spontaneously perfected.” - John Tan, 2019\n“Insight that 'anatta' is a seal and not a stage must arise to further progress into the 'effortless' mode. That\nis, anatta is the ground of all experiences and has always been so, no I. In seeing, always only seen, in\nhearing always only sound and in thinking, always only thoughts. No effort required and never was there\nan 'I'.” - John Tan, 2009\n“You need to contemplate on anatta correctly as mentioned by\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/09/robert-dominiks-breakthrough.html (seeing anatta as\ndharma seal rather than merely a state of no mind)” – Soh, 2020\nIt is important\n“Without thorough breakthrough of both stanzas of anatta 1 and 2, there is no thorough or clear realization\nof anatta proper in AtR definition. Although the 2nd was clearer to me in the beginning breakthrough in\nOctober 2010, the 1st stanza shortly became clearer in the following months and dissolving further\ngrounding, including a very subtle grounding to a Here/Now as well as any subtle remaining referencing to\nMind (although that is already largely dissolved, a very subtle unseen tendency was seen and dissolved\nlater).” – Soh, 2020\n“The 2 stanzas below are pivotal in leading me to the direct experience of no-self. Although they appear to\nconvey the same stuff about anatta, meditating on these 2 stanzas can yield 2 very different experiential\ninsights -- one on the emptiness aspect and the other, the non-dual luminosity aspect. The insights that\narise from these experiences are very illuminating as they contradict so much our ordinary understanding\nof what awareness is.” - John Tan, 2009\n459\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“TD Unmanifest\n3h ·\nI have found that in my practice that emptying the subject to be “easier” than emptying the object.

When object\nis further emptied, we see Dharmakaya. Do See clearly that for the case of a ‘subject’ that is first penetrated,\nit is a mere label collating the 5 aggregates but for the next level that is to be negated, it is the Presence\nthat we are emptying -- not a label but the very presence itself that is non-dual in nature.\"\nIt has progressed very well in deepening annata, but I was contemplating from the perspective of objects\nvs subject.

So what is anatta? Means when you penetrate no-agent,\nyou are effectively developing your direct insight. That is not reifying anything extra. That is direct insight\ninto suchness.

So we say arise in dependence.”\n“Is there in you an entity which you call the 'I' or the 'mind' or the 'self'? Is there a co- ordinator who is co-\nordinating what you are looking at with what you are listening to, what you are smelling with what you are\ntasting, and so on? Or is there anything which links together the various sensations originating from a single\nsense -- the flow of impulses from the eyes, for example? Actually, there is always a gap between any two\nsensations. The co-ordinator bridges that gap: he establishes himself as an illusion of continuity.\nIn the natural state there is no entity who is coordinating the messages from the different senses. Each\nsense is functioning independently in its own way. When there is a demand from outside which makes it\nnecessary to coordinate one or two or all of the senses and come up with a response, still there is no co-\nordinator, but there is a temporary state of coordination. There is no continuity; when the demand has\nbeen met, again there is only the uncoordinated, disconnected, disjointed functioning of the senses. This is\n463\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nalways the case. Once the continuity is blown apart -- not that it was ever there; but the illusory continuity\n-- it's finished once and for all.\nCan this make any sense to you? It cannot. All that you know lies within the framework of your experience,\nwhich is of thought. This state is not an experience. I am only trying to give you a 'feel' of it, which is,\nunfortunately, misleading.\nWhen there is no co-ordinator, there is no linking of sensations, there is no translating of sensations; they\nstay pure and simple sensations. I don't even know that they are sensations. I may look at you as you are\ntalking. The eyes will focus on your mouth because that is what is moving, and the ears will receive the\nsound vibrations. There is nothing inside which links up the two and says that it is you talking. I may be\nlooking at a spring bubbling out of the earth and hear the water, but there is nothing to say that the noise\nbeing heard is the sound of water, or that that sound is in any way connected with what I am seeing. I may\nbe looking at my foot, but nothing says that this is my foot. When I am walking, I see my feet moving -- it is\nsuch a funny thing: \"What is that which is moving?\"\nWhat functions is a primordial consciousness, untouched by thought.” - U.G. Krishnamurti, U.G.\nKrishnamurti: The Mystique of Enlightenment\n“Let's say it will be noticed that the body is out of shape. A thought may arise that the body could do with\nsome exercise. Next a decision to go to the gym could come up. Nowhere in this 'chain of events' is there\nthe need for an entity that takes the decision. If there was such an entity, it first would have to decide to\ntake such a decision to be able to claim 'authorship.' It also would have to decide to decide to decide ad\ninfinitum, thus creating an infinite regress.\nWhat I always say is that non-doership does not mean that you are helpless, but that the 'you-agent' is\nfictitious. We say \"I live, I think, I breathe\" and so on but living, thinking and breathing is not done by\nsomeone; it happens by itself.\nLet's have a look at thinking: Is there really a 'thinker of thoughts' independent of thought? Does this\n'thinker' know what the next thought will be? Or is the thought only known when it comes along? This\nthought may get claimed in the next thought, which could goes something like \"Oh, I just thought about\nsuch and such\". But is the 'I' claiming to be the thinker of the thought- not itself part of the thought?\nDo not take this too literally please, as there actually isn't even a 'next thought'; only this thought right now.\nThere is no past, which has led up to this moment. There is only THIS; including memories and other\napparent evidence for such a past.\nNevertheless, there is the unfolding of this dream in which \"the Tao, without doing anything, leaves nothing\nundone.\" As such there may be the appearance of doing exercises, making decisions, planning your day,\n464\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nfalling asleep, waking up, gazing at the stars, reading these words, or registering the sounds around you. It\nall happens by itself. As the Zen saying goes:\nSitting quietly, doing nothing,\nSpring comes, and the grass grows by itself.” - Leo Hartong\n“What Leo said is experientially there but in terms of understanding there is a great difference from that of\nBuddhism. You must go deeper and arise the insight of anatta and dependent origination.\n\"There is no thinker, just thoughts\". A practitioner must not only see that there is \"no agent\", he must also\nsee the \"just thoughts\". 'Thought' not as a passing phenomenon and nothing to care about but thought as\npristine, luminous, non-dual, emptiness, its dependent originated nature and powerful imprints it can\ncause leading to the understanding of actions and tendencies rolling on. The best part is when 'tendency'\nis experienced in conventional sense it appears 'so solidly real'. Only when emptiness nature is directly\nexperienced does reality becomes dream-like.\nThere are 4 important insights a practitioner must have on the experience of anatta:\n1. The no doership leading to a spontaneous arising experience. Though spontaneous, it is not by\n'nature' or 'haphazard'; with the presence of conditions, the arising is spontaneous.\n2. The absence of an agent leading to a 'direct' experience of phenomena. A non-dual experience that\ndissolve the subject/object split.\n3. No doer but there is doing and leading to the understanding of imprints and actions.\n4. The impermanence and manifestation that leads to the understanding of arising due to conditions.\nThe no-self nature of dependent origination that is free from the view based on who, where and\nwhen.\nBuddhism is not exactly the union or co-arising of subjective witness and objective phenomena but rather\nthe inseparability of luminosity and emptiness, appearances and conditions.\nDo not take this too literally please, as there actually isn't even a 'next thought'; only this thought right now. There\nis no past, which has led up to this moment. There is only THIS; including memories and other apparent evidence\nfor such a past.\nThis is an experiential glimpse of non-arising in Buddhism, try to go beyond the 'now' teaching and\nunderstand the emptiness nature even this moment of Presence.\nThere is just this actual moment, which is a thought. Not arising from anywhere or going anywhere. There\nis even no “right now”, no timeline; free from the dream of the 3 times and resting entirely in this actual\nphenomena which is, a thought. Arising and ceasing is an appearance, the nature of clarity is non-arising,\nalways just this: a moment, a thought, a witnessing, an action, yet empty!\n465\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nNevertheless, there is the unfolding of this dream in which \"the Tao, without doing anything, leaves nothing\nundone.\" As such there may be the appearance of doing exercises, making decisions, planning your day, falling\nasleep, waking up, gazing at the stars, reading these words, or registering the sounds around you. It all happens\nby itself. As the Zen saying goes:\nSitting quietly, doing nothing,\nSpring comes, and the grass grows by itself.\nAlthough there is no authorship, it is also not 'helplessness'. There is no doer but there is doing. Free from\nthe 2 extremes, karma and dependent origination are taught.\nTo progress further, you must understand the differences and experience it directly.” - John Tan, 2009, in\nresponse to Leo’s statement above\n2. The direct insight of the absence of an agent\n“In this case, there is a direct recognition that there is “no agent”. Just one thought then another thought.\nSo it is always thought watching thought rather than a watcher watching thought. However the gist of this\nrealization is skewed towards a spontaneous liberating experience and a vague glimpse of the empty\nnature of phenomena -- that is, the transient phenomena being bubble-like and ephemeral, nothing\nsubstantial or solid. At this phase we should not misunderstand that we have experienced thoroughly the\n‘empty’ nature of phenomena and awareness, although there is this temptation to think we have. -:)\nDepending on the conditions of an individual, it may not be obvious that it is “always thought watching\nthought rather than a watcher watching thought.” or \"the watcher is that thought.\"” - John Tan, 2009\n“In the article on https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-\nspontaneous.html, I mentioned about the 2 stanza. There is the no-agent aspect and there is the intensity\nof luminosity aspect. I find that your present experience is still centered on the luminosity aspect. You are\ndirectly experiencing seamlessness of any happening where no clear line of demarcation can be drawn\nbetween the subject-object split. You realized the boundary is purely illusionary and is clear about the cause\nthat resulted in such\ndivision but still, that is not the ‘essence’ of an experiential insight of anatta in my opinion. There is a\ndifference in saying \"there is no split between thinking and thinker, the thinking itself is 'me'\" and \"there is\nthinking, no thinker\". You must be aware that having immediate and direct experience but with dualistic\nframework intact and complete replacement of the dualistic framework entirely with DO (dependent\norigination) yields very different experiential insight; you may want to investigate further and move from\n466\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"they are all flowing independently\" to \"manifesting in seamless inter-dependencies.\" - John Tan, 2010\n“In the Vajrayana there is the direct path to examining mind. In everyday life we are habituated to thinking,\n\"I have a mind and I perceive these things.\" Ordinarily, we do not directly look at the mind and therefore\ndo not see the mind. This is very strange because we see things and we know that we are seeing visual\nphenomena. But who is seeing? We can look directly at the mind and find that there is no one seeing; there\nis no seer, and yet we are seeing phenomena. The same is true for the mental consciousness. We think\nvarious thoughts, but where is that thinking taking place? Who or what is thinking? However, when we look\ndirectly at the mind, we discover that there is nobody there; there is no thinker and yet thinking is going on.\nThis approach of directly looking in a state of meditation isn't one of reasoning, but of directly looking at\nthe mind to see what is there.” - Thrangu Rinpoche, Thrangu Rinpoche on Nature of Mind\n“Alan Watts: ...Upon reflection, there seems to be nothing unreasonable in seeing the world in this way. The\nagent behind every action is itself action. If a mat can be called matting, a cat can be called catting. We do\nnot actually need to ask who or what \"cats,\" just as we do not need to ask what is the basic stuff or substance\nout of which the world is formed---for there is no way of describing this substance except in terms of form,\nof structure, order, and operation…\nAndré A. Pais \"The agent behind every action is itself action\".\nGreat insight.\nJohn Tan Therefore it is the action that knows, no knower.\nManage” - Alan Watts: Agent and Action\n~ Stanza two\nIn thinking, just thoughts\nIn hearing, just sounds\nIn seeing, just forms, shapes and colors.\nDirect realization of luminosity/radiance as the very vividness of forms and textures\nof transience beyond subject/object division.\n“Division of subject and object is merely an assumption.\nThus someone giving up and something to be given up is an illusion.\nWhen self becomes more and more transparent,\nLikewise phenomena become more and more luminous.\nIn thorough transparency all happening are pristinely and vividly clear.\n467\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nObviousness throughout, aliveness everywhere!” - John Tan, 2009\n“(9:14 PM) Thusness: when we talk about Buddha’s teachings, the essence should be so: the electricity\n[analogy used to represent consciousness] should not be taken as an entity. The organs are part of the\nconditions for manifestations. When condition arises, it is the luminosity of the appearances that you must\nknow. You never see or know what awareness is unless through conditions where appearances manifest,\nthat vividness of appearance is awareness in real time and life… ...not what I see glows, it is the seeing is\nthe object is the awareness” - John Tan, 2007\n“In the seen, there is just the seen! It is completely non-dual... there is no 'the seen + a perceiver here seeing\nthe seen'.... The seen is precisely the seeing! There is not two or three things: seer, seeing, and the seen.\nThat split is entirely conceptual (though taken to be reality)... it is a conclusion due to a referencing back of\na direct experience (like a sight or a sound) to a centerpoint.” - Soh Wei Yu, 2010, My commentary on Bahiya\nSutta\n“...We don’t need to bring our awareness anywhere -\nawareness is always within the arising\nof the experience itself.\nWe don’t need to make any separation\nbetween bodily sensations and awareness.\nBodily sensations are already awareness.\nThought is already awareness.\nWe don’t need to bring\nawareness to the thought.\nWhat we’re exploring\nis not the body\nbut the body’s awareness.\nWe’re just exploring\nthe body of awareness…” - Charles Genoud, Gesture of Awareness\n“...have adequate experience of the vividness, realness and presence of Awareness and the full experience\nof these qualities in the transience. Without which it will not be easy to realize that \"the arising and passing\nsensations are the very awareness itself.\" A balance is therefore needed, otherwise practitioners may\nexperience equanimity but skew towards dispassion and lack realization.“ - John Tan, 2009, Emptiness as\nViewless View and Embracing the Transience\n468\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"The key towards pure knowingness is to bring the taste of presence into the 6 entries and exits. So that\nwhat is seen, heard, touched, tasted are pervaded by a deep sense of crystal, radiance and transparency.\nThis requires seeing through the center.\" - John Tan\n“...Similarly, regarding whatever is in the field of the tactile sense organ, such things as fabrics that are soft\nor rough to the touch, this tactile sensation itself is your own mind. Avoid slipping into grasping or rejecting.\nWhether soft or rough, do not try to find the mind anywhere apart from the softness or roughness itself,\nbut rest at ease right there without distraction. If a pleasant or an unpleasant feeling arises, recognize it\nand rest mindfully.\n…\nLord Gotsangpa said:\n\"In general, the apparent myriad of phenomena is one’s own mind. Since phenomena and emptiness have\nnever been abiding as two separate entities, there is no need to restrain cognizance within.\"\nAlso:\n\"When there is an appearance of a form in the field of the eyes, that appearance of form itself is one’s mind;\nthe apparent form and emptiness are not two. By resting gently right on the form without grasping, subject\nand object become naturally liberated. The same applies to sounds, smells, tastes, textures, as well as\nmental occurrences: by resting on the occurrence itself, it becomes self-liberated. That is to say, instead of\nmeditating on cognizance, by meditating without grasping right on the outer objects of the six sense\nperceptions, the six senses arise as meditation and enhancement will ensue.\"” - Self-Liberation by Khamtrul\nRinpoche III\n“When you look into a thought's identity, without having to dissolve the thought and without having to force\nit out by meditation, the vividness of the thought is itself the indescribable and naked state of aware\nemptiness. We call this seeing the natural face of innate thought or thought dawns as dharmakaya.\n…\n\"When you vividly perceive a mountain or a house, no matter how this perception appears, it does not need\nto disappear or be stopped. Rather, while this perception is experienced, it is itself an intangible, empty\nawareness. This is called seeing the identity of perception.\"\n\"Previously you cleared up uncertainties when you looked into the identity of a perception and resolved\nthat perceptions are mind. Accordingly, the perception is not outside and the mind is not inside…” –\nClarifying the Natural State by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, excerpts in Resolving That Thoughts and Perceptions\n469\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nare Buddha-Mind\n“Hi Mr. J, Despite all differences we may have about lower yanas, no practices needed, Absolute…I really\nappreciate your zealous attempt to bring this message into view and I agree with you wholeheartedly on\nthis aspect of “transmission”. If one truly wants this essence to be “transmitted”, how can it be otherwise?\nFor what that is to be passed is truly of different dimension, how can it be adulterated with words and\nforms? The ancient teachers are extremely serious observing and waiting for the right condition to pass the\nessence unreservedly and wholeheartedly. So much so that when the essence is transmitted, it must boil\nthe blood and penetrate deep into the bone marrow. The entire body-mind must become one opening eye.\nOnce open, everything turns “spirit”, mind intellect drops and what’s left is aliveness and intelligence\neverywhere! Mr. J, I sincerely hope you well, just don’t leave trace in the Absolute. Gone! :)” - John Tan, 2013\n“Ok... I am seeing your point as \"awareness\" outside of conditioned experience is an imputation. When\ncould one ever have such an experience outside of experience? The \"knowing\" of being would also be an\nexperience, as opposed to the \"not knowing\". And if there was \"not knowing\", then how you could prove\nthere was \"awareness\" in such a \"not knowing\"? Very interesting.\nWell, its not really new... it is just clear now how there is an imputation we put on Awareness as being\n\"separate' from experience, as some sort of \"stand alone\" awareness\". I have always experienced\nawareness as experience inseparably so, but didn't notice the subtle imputation that gives still a separate\nimplication of being a remainder, when all things are absent. Being wouldn't know itself outside of\nexperience. If being did know itself in total voidness, that very \"knowing\" would itself be an experience,\nhence the void would not be void. God cannot be separated from creation, because the potential for\ncreation is already Known.” - Mr. J, 2012\n“What is presence now? Everything... Taste saliva, smell, think, what is that? Snap of a finger, sing. All\nordinary activity, zero effort therefore nothing attained. Yet is full accomplishment. In esoteric terms, eat\nGod, taste God, see God, hear God...lol. That is the first thing I told Mr. J few years back when he first\nmessaged me If a mirror is there, this is not possible. If clarity isn't empty, this isn't possible. Not even\nslightest effort is needed. Do you feel it? Grabbing of my legs as if I am grabbing presence! Do you have this\nexperience already? When there is no mirror, then entire existence is just lights-sounds-sensations as single\npresence. Presence is grabbing presence. The movement to grab legs is Presence.. the sensation of\ngrabbing legs is Presence.. For me even typing or blinking my eyes. For fear that it is misunderstood, don't\ntalk about it. Right understanding is no presence, for every single sense of knowingness is different.\nOtherwise Mr. J will say nonsense... lol. When there is a mirror, this is not possible. Think I wrote to longchen\n(Sim Pern Chong) about 10 years ago.” - John Tan\n“It is such a blessing after 15 years of \"I Am\" to come to this point . Beware that the habitual tendencies will\ntry its very best to take back what it has lost. Get use to doing nothing. Eat God, taste God, see God and\ntouch God.\n470\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nCongrats.” – John Tan to Sim Pern Chong after his initial breakthrough from I AM to no-self in 2006,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2013/12/part-2-of-early-forum-posts-by-thusness_3.html\n“An interesting comment Mr. J. After realization… Just eat God, breathe God, smell God and see God… Lastly\nbe fully unestablished and liberate God.” - John Tan, 2012\n(Soh: Lest readers misinterpret that John is affirming a substantialist notion of a ‘God’, it should be noted\nthat by the phase of Anatta realization, there is simply no more reifications or conceivings of a metaphysical\n‘God’ or ‘Creator’ of any kind, and John was simply using the lingo of Mr. J to convey the complete absence\nof a background substratum of Presence and the total luminosity of Presencing-as-manifestation to Mr. J\nusing Mr. J’s ‘esoteric lingo’. Even the word ‘Presence’ is not referring to some static entity here - ‘Presencing’\nis perhaps a better term, for as James M. Corrigan wrote, “...Awareness is not something other than the\n“presencing” (i.e. naturing) of appearances. It is not a thing. It is not part of a thing. It is not an “aspect” of a\nprocess… ...it is the process—not some aspect of it”\n[11:59 PM, 6/16/2020] John Tan: (On the See god, eat god… post) Don't underestimate this. An insight as\nimportant as anatta post the insight. Focus on this part. It is very important, if you can Intuit the insight\nthat lead to this, the rest is not important. There are many intellectual obscurations and at times the\nmind is being block and just can't release itself. Same insight but just can't apply it on different situation\nrelating to different mental proliferation. The Freedom and release from such an insight is not freedom\nfrom conceptuality but a freedom from seeing distinction thereby leading to a direct\nauthentication. Because it is such an important insight, I will write something for you maybe later. Focus\non it diligently.\n~ The Importance to Balance The Two Stanzas of Anatta\nSoh: The two stanzas of anatta are linked to this: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/06/pellucid-\nno-self-non-doership.html\n[8:40 PM, 6/9/2021] John Tan: 1. Dzogchen has a phrase \"spontaneous presence\". I do not know it's exact\nmeaning in dzogchen however the phrase is intimately related to the 2 experiences of the 2 stanzas:\n1. No doership = spontaneous\n2. Mere appearances as Presence\nYou'll see that I wrote about both aspects in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/04/why-\nawakening-is-so-worth-it.html\n471\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nWithout realizing of the second stanza of anatta in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/on-\nanatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html , it is not considered genuine anatman (no-self) realisation in\nAtR. Related: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/06/pellucid-no-self-non-doership.html ,\nhttp://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/07/i-was-having-conversation-with-someone.html ,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/02/the-transient-universe-has-heart.html ,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2023/05/nice-advice-and-expression-of-anatta-in.html\nI have also remarked that 99% of the time, people who said they realised no-self merely experienced the\nnon-doership aspect and not the genuine nondual anatman realisation. Also see:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/04/different-degress-of-no-self-non.html\nBased on my experiences from discussions with thousands of individuals, I've observed that claims of\nrecognizing nonduality—where there's no differentiation between the internal and external, or an\nabsence of self—do not necessarily indicate a true realization of anatman or an authentic nondual\nexperience or insight. Often, there is a chance that the person is simply adopting specific jargon or\nimitating others, under the impression that they have reached a similar level of understanding. However,\nin reality, their experience may only encompass a sense of impersonality and non-doership, rather than a\ngenuine nondual experience or insight.\nI (Soh) have once asked John Tan if he thinks a certain teacher has realised anatta, to which John replied,\n“There is no authentication of one's radiance, no recognition of appearances as one's radiance and no\nclear pointing of how conventional constructs (Soh: are seen through and released). So what led you to\nthat conclusion?”\nAdditionally, commenting on a certain teacher’s writings, John Tan wrote,\n“When we say \"Mind is the great earth\", the first step is to understand and taste what is mind before we\ngo a step further.\nIf the teaching doesn't teach and taste what mind is, then it is just beautiful talks and grandious speech.\nNext one has to point out what is \"great earth\"? Where is this \"great earth\"? The soil, the ground, the\nflower, the air or buildings or the conventional world?\nThen talk about what is total exertion they have been talking?\n472\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThen the integration of the mind and total exertion and that is +A.”\nHowever it does not mean the second stanza of anatta is more important than the first stanza. In fact,\nafter awakening the second stanza of anatta, the pellucid radiance as all appearances beyond the\nparadigm of subject-action-object, it is vital to penetrate deeply into the first stanza.\nEverything self-arises without doer or agent, as natural as breathing and heart beating. Thoroughly\npenetrating this, be completely spontaneous and effortless and releasing. Natural radiance is completely\neffortless, 0 effort required at all. Let deep insight into anatman and emptiness carry you into self-\nliberation and spontaneous perfection and dissolve the disease of effort and subtle overfocusing or\nclinging to radiance. As John Tan also said before, it is important not to over emphasize on the radiance\n(lest it causes the unpleasant effects of energy imbalance), and that it must be complemented with the\nfirst stanza of non-doership. He added that after non-dual, one's practice must be relaxed and open,\ninsubstantial and free -- be natural and open, light, relaxed and effortless, then contemplate on\neffortlessness. The openness and relaxation should build up into a momentum in one's practice.\nAdditionally, as John Tan said, we have to understand the relationship between non-doership and total\nexertion -- allowing the totality of the situations to exert itself. Seen from one side of the coin, it is\ncomplete \"effortlessness\" of radiance, and seen from another side, it is the exertion of the totality of\nconditions.\nSatsang Nathan videos are a good expression of the non-doership aspect of anatta. See: Satsang Nathan\nVideos https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/thusnesspasserby-thinks-these-videos.html\nJohn Tan said before, \"For Mr. N insomnia issue, he has to solve it by dwelling deeper into the\neffortlessness and natural spontaneity of one's radiance nature which is the first part of anatta.\nMany misunderstood about non-action, non-mentation, not needing to do anything.\nBefore we can talk about natural spontaneity, we must first understand what exactly is \"action\", \"doing\"\nand \"mentation\".\nThat is, the default mode we are in is always \"doing\" and in a state of mentation. Even when we are\nsitting doing nothing, we are in such a mode of \"action\". Given time, we will tensed up and mind will\nalways doing something, it is far from naturally releasing.\n473\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSo it is the same as de-constructive path, we don't have to worry about the ultimate, emptiness of the\nconventional is the ultimate. So we need to clearly understand what reified constructs are all about.\nSimilarly we in awareness and energy practice, we need to clearly understand what \"doing and action\"\nmeans, we don't have to worry about radiance and natural state.\nWhen our radiance gets intensified, even more important is the opening up, however more likely than\nnot, we are doing the opposite.\"\nAlso, John Tan said, \"I have told you many times not to over emphasize on radiance, so you need to be\nmindful. It must be complemented with the first stanza of non-doership. For you, after non-dual, your\npractice [should] be relaxed and open, insubstantial and free. Be light and effortless then contemplate on\neffortlessness. Is your openness and relaxation a momentum now?\"\nJohn Tan: \"For you, just be light and insubstantial. You must balance first stanza with second to prevent\nover focusing on radiance.\"\n~ Vipassana\n“Before proceeding any further, it is of absolute importance to know that there is no way the stanzas can\nbe correctly understood by way of inference, logical deduction or induction. Not that there is something\nmystical or transcendental about the stanzas but simply the way of mental chattering is a 'wrong approach'.\nThe right technique is through 'vipassana' or any more direct and attentive bare mode of observation that\nallows the seeing of things as they are. Just a casual note, such mode of knowing turns natural when non-\ndual insight matures, before that it can be quite 'efforting'.” - John Tan, 2009\n“As whatever can be expressed is easily reified, objectified and grasped instead of realizing it is merely\npointing at seen, heard, sensed ...all 6 entries and exits, nothing beyond. The conventions created artificial\nboundaries when there is none. So vipassana is taught but not just the 3 seals (impermanence, suffering,\nnon-self) needs to go hand in hand with the luminous manifestation. Otherwise it becomes just a mindful\nreminder but vipassana is a direct insight.” - John Tan, 2019\nA good video on Vipassana by Daniel M. Ingram and relating it to anatta realization:\nhttps://vimeo.com/250616410\n“Good insight. Stability of experience has a predictable relationship with the unfolding and deepening of\ninsights. For example how seamless and effortless can non-dual experience be, if in the back of one's mind,\nsubtle views of duality and inherency and tendencies continue to surface and affect our moment to\nmoment experience - for example conjuring an unchanging source or mind that results in a perpetual\ntendency to sink back and referencing experience back to a source.\n474\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nFor example even after it is seen that everything is a manifestation of awareness or mind, there might still\nbe subtle tendencies to reference back to a source, awareness or mind and therefore the transience is not\nappreciated in full. Nondual is experienced but one sinks back into substantial nonduality - there is always\na referencing back to a base, an \"awareness\" that is nevertheless inseparable from all phenomena.\nIf one arises the insight that our ideas of an unchanging source, awareness or mind is just another thought\n- that there is simply thought after thought, sight after sight, sound after sound, and there isn't an inherent\nor unchanging \"awareness\", \"mind\", \"source\". Non-dual becomes implicit and effortless when there is the\nrealisation that what awareness, seeing, hearing really is, is just the seen... The heard... The transience...\nThe transience itself rolls and knows, no knower or other \"awareness\" can be found. Like there is no river\napart from flowing, no wind apart from blowing, each noun implies its verb... Similarly awareness is simply\nthe process of knowing not separated from the known. Scenery sees, music hears. Because there is nothing\nunchanging, independent, ultimate apart from the transience, there is no more sinking back to a source\nand instead there is full comfort resting as the transience itself.\nLastly do continue practicing the intensity of luminosity... When looking at tennis ball just sense the tennis\nball fully.... Without thinking of a source, background, observer, self. Just the tennis ball as a luminous light.\nWhen breathing... Just the breathe... When seeing scenery, just sights, shapes and colours - intensely\nluminous and vivid without an agent or observer. When hearing music... Sound of bird chirping, the\ncrickets… Just that - chirp chirp. A zen master noted upon his awakening... When I am hearing the bell\nringing, there is no I and no bell... Just the ringing. The direct experiencing of no-mind and intensity of\nluminosity..

You don’t die, don’t change, don’t move, and you are Buddha.\nBlessed Vesak.

The bird, the\nsky, the touch, the coffee, are all your MIND. MIND once ascertained and strengthen will take one out of\n“self view” to realisation & we won’t get lost.\n…\nThe Satipatthana sutta is a wonderful instruction to reach insight.\n“Feel the body in the body”, when practicing, don’t think.

Everything that exists can be placed\ninto one of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness—the body, the feelings, the mind, and the objects of\nthe mind. Another way of saying “objects of mind” is “all dharmas,” which means “everything that is.”\nTherefore, all of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness are objects of the mind. In this sutra, we practice\nfull awareness of the Four Establishments through conscious breathing. For a full understanding of the\nFour Establishments of Mindfulness, read the Satipatthana Sutta.24\nThe phrases “observing the body in the body,” “observing the feelings in the feelings,” “observing the mind\nin the mind,” and “observing the objects of mind in the objects of mind,” appear in the third section of the\nsutra. The key to “observation meditation” is that the subject of observation and the object of observation\nnot be regarded as separate. A scientist might try to separate herself from the object she is observing and\nmeasuring, but students of meditation have to remove the boundary between subject and object. When\nwe observe something, we are that thing. “Nonduality” is the key word. “Observing the body in the body”\nmeans that in the process of observing, you don’t stand outside your own body as if you were an\nindependent observer, but you identify yourself one hundred percent with the object being observed.\nThis is the only path that can lead to the penetration and direct experience of reality. In “observation\nmeditation,” the body and mind are one entity, and the subject and object of meditation are one entity\nalso. There is no sword of discrimination that slices reality into many parts. The meditator is a fully\nengaged participant, not a separate observer.\"\n(2011-12-20T22:58:59). Awakening of the Heart . Parallax Press. Kindle Edition.\n2\nlevel 2\nxabir\n· 21 hr. ago\nIf you can practice the above and go along with this understanding and contemplation of anatman, you\nwill have profound experiential awakening to your true nature:\nZen Master Thich Nhat Hanh:\n\"When we say it's raining, we mean that raining is taking place. You don't need someone up above to\nperform the raining. It's not that there is the rain, and there is the one who causes the rain to fall. In fact,\nwhen you say the rain is falling, it's very funny, because if it weren't falling, it wouldn't be rain. In our way\nof speaking, we're used to having a subject and a verb. That's why we need the word \"it\" when we say, \"it\nrains.\" \"It\" is the subject, the one who makes the rain possible. But, looking deeply, we don't need a\n\"rainer,\" we just need the rain. Raining and the rain are the same. The formations of birds and the birds\nare the same -- there's no \"self,\" no boss involved.\n481\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThere's a mental formation called vitarka, \"initial thought.\" When we use the verb \"to think\" in English, we\nneed a subject of the verb: I think, you think, he thinks. But, really, you don't need a subject for a thought\nto be produced. Thinking without a thinker -- it's absolutely possible. To think is to think about something.\nTo perceive is to perceive something. The perceiver and the perceived object that is perceived are one.\nWhen Descartes said, \"I think, therefore I am,\" his point was that if I think, there must be an \"I\" for\nthinking to be possible. When he made the declaration \"I think,\" he believed that he could demonstrate\nthat the \"I\" exists. We have the strong habit or believing in a self. But, observing very deeply, we can see\nthat a thought does not need a thinker to be possible. There is no thinker behind the thinking -- there is\njust the thinking; that's enough.\nNow, if Mr. Descartes were here, we might ask him, \"Monsieur Descartes, you say, 'You think, therefore\nyou are.' But what are you? You are your thinking. Thinking -- that's enough. Thinking manifests without\nthe need of a self behind it.\"\nThinking without a thinker. Feeling without a feeler. What is our anger without our 'self'? This is the object\nof our meditation. All the fifty-one mental formations take place and manifest without a self behind them\narranging for this to appear, and then for that to appear. Our mind consciousness is in the habit of basing\nitself on the idea of self, on manas. But we can meditate to be more aware of our store consciousness,\nwhere we keep the seeds of all those mental formations that are not currently manifesting in our mind.\nWhen we meditate, we practice looking deeply in order to bring light and clarity into our way of seeing\nthings. When the vision of no-self is obtained, our delusion is removed. This is what we call\ntransformation. In the Buddhist tradition, transformation is possible with deep understanding. The\nmoment the vision of no-self is there, manas, the elusive notion of 'I am,' disintegrates, and we find\nourselves enjoying, in this very moment, freedom and happiness.\"\n......\n\"When we say I know the wind is blowing, we don't think that there is something blowing something else.\n\"Wind' goes with 'blowing'. If there is no blowing, there is no wind. It is the same with knowing. Mind is the\nknower; the knower is mind. We are talking about knowing in relation to the wind. 'To know' is to know\nsomething. Knowing is inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing are one. We can say, 'Wind,' and\nthat is enough. The presence of wind indicates the presence of knowing, and the presence of the action of\nblowing'.\"\n\"..The most universal verb is the verb 'to be'': I am, you are, the mountain is, a river is. The verb 'to be'\ndoes not express the dynamic living state of the universe. To express that we must say 'become.' These\ntwo verbs can also be used as nouns: 'being\", \"becoming\". But being what? Becoming what? 'Becoming'\nmeans 'evolving ceaselessly', and is as universal as the verb \"to be.\" It is not possible to express the\n\"being\" of a phenomenon and its \"becoming\" as if the two were independent. In the case of wind, blowing\nis the being and the becoming....\"\n\"In any phenomena, whether psychological, physiological, or physical, there is dynamic movement, life.\nWe can say that this movement, this life, is the universal manifestation, the most commonly recognized\naction of knowing. We must not regard 'knowing' as something from the outside which comes to breathe\nlife into the universe. It is the life of the universe itself. The dance and the dancer are one.\"\n482\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n2\n------\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html\nHARISH\nApr 29, 2010, 11:48:00 AM\nThankyou sir.

Some masters of the Abhidhamma say that the purpose of this repetition\nis to underline the importance of these words. I see it otherwise. I think that these words are repeated in\norder to remind us not to separate the meditator and the object of meditation. We must live with the\nobject, identify with it, merge with it, like a grain of salt entering the sea in order to measure the saltiness\nof the sea.\"\nAlso on a related note... Dr. John Welwood writes,\n\"We can only perceive the suchness of things through an awareness that opens to them nonconceptualy\nand unconditionally, allowing them to reveal themselves in their as-it-is-ness. As the poet Basho suggests:\n'From the pine tree\nLearn of the pine tree\nAnd from the bamboo\nof the bamboo.'\nCommenting on these lines, the Japanese philosopher Nishitani (1982) explains that Basho does not\nmean\n'That we should ‘observe the pine tree carefully.’ Still less does he mean for us to ‘study the pine tree\nscientifically.’ He means for us to enter the mode of being where the pine tree is the pine tree itself, and\nthe bamboo is the bamboo itself, and from there to look at the pine tree and the bamboo. He calls on us\nto betake ourselves to the dimension where things become manifest in their suchness.' (p. 128)\nIn the same vein, Zen Master Dogen advises: “You should not restrict yourselves to learning to see water\nfrom the viewpoints of human beings alone. Know that you must see water in the way water sees water”\n483\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(Izutsu, 1972, p. 140). “Seeing water in the way water sees water” means recognizing water in its suchness,\nfree of all concepts that spring from an observing mind standing back from experience.\"\n.......\nYou will see the \"in and of itself\" stressed throughout the Mahasatipatthana sutta, what I have quoted is\nonly a small portion.\nhttp://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.than.html\n- https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html\n------\nWhat is experiential insight\nYin Ling:\nWhen we say experiential insight in Buddhism,\nIt means..\nA literal transformation of energetic orientation of the whole being, down to the marrow.\nThe sound MUST literally hears themselves.\nNo hearer.\nClean.

Likewise for\n“awareness” and “experience”: awareness is not aware of experience, but is none other than experience.\n486\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSame for “hearer-hearing-sound”, “seer-seeing-colors”, “doer-doing-deed”, etc. The subject-action-object\nparadigm is thus seen through.\nSoh wrote in 2013:\nV: \"...there is somewhere a One Thinker (of thought)\"\nMe: \"A thinker is thinking a thought\" is simply a construct of a faulty framework and view of inherent and\ndualistic self. Just like language is structured in a way that it often requires subject-action-object predicates,\nmaking us to say things like \"the wind is blowing\", \"I am thinking a thought\"... but is there really a truly\nexisting and independent thing called \"the wind\" that \"is blowing\" or is \"wind\" and \"blowing\" simply two\nwords referring to a single activity? Likewise is there truly an \"I\" that is \"thinking, a thought\" or is \"I\",\n\"thinking\", and \"thought\" three different labels imputed on a single activity? Seer, seeing and seen are just\na conventional view... they only appear as separate, independent existences due to ignorance but such a\nview does not tally with reality.\nRiver is flowing doesn't mean there is an independent thing called \"river\" that is \"flowing\", it actually means\nriver IS the flowing and apart from the flowing there is no river... just conventional labels applied to a single\nactivity. Wind is blowing means wind IS the blowing and apart from blowing there is no other wind... seeing\nthe scenery means seeing IS the seen/scenery and apart from that seen/scenery there is no other seeing\n(nor a separate seer), there is no other consciousness apart from the specific manifest experience -\nseen/heard/sensed/smelled/touched/cognized. Mere conventions applied to a single activity, appearing to\nco-locate with each other in an independent and separate manner due to a distorted view that causes us\nto misperceive reality in a fundamental way, just like mis-perceiving a rope as a snake. Once we see that\nthere isn't anything that 'nouns' point to than pure action/activity, then the verb alone is sufficient - 'blowing',\n'flowing', 'thinking', 'seeing' - which is none other than the seen, thought, etc. There is no 'you', 'seer',\n'thinker' apart from seeing which is sight, hearing which is sound, etc.\nWhen we directly contemplate, investigate and challenge our view of 'seer-seeing-seen' and see that in the\nseen is merely the seen - that seeing is simply the seen and seen is just the seeing without any seer apart,\nthat there is no other consciousness apart from the 'mere seen/mere cognized', a permanent quantum\nshift of perception takes place. When this is directly realized in one's experience and not merely understood\ninferentially, any delusion of agency (doer, controller, feeler), subject-object/perceiver-perceived gaps,\ndivisions are seen through, the gapless/undivided self-clarity of experience without an agent, center or\nboundaries simply shines vividly in its raw, direct, unfiltered purity, and just that is free and liberating in\nitself. Later comes this seeing - the mind, the body, the breathing, the environment, in seamless exertion!\nV: \"Yes... only verbs... This is a great pointer!!!! Wow!!! Thank you Soh! I will sit with that pointer! It is so\npowerful! It is blowing my \"mind\" ! How could there ever be a story only with verbs? Yes! Yes! That's it! A\nverb can't \"build\" a self. Thank you so much!!!!!\"\n487\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“From \"The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\" by Alan Watts:\nAs soon as one sees that separate things are fictitious, it becomes obvious that nonexistent things cannot\n“perform” actions. The difficulty is that most languages are arranged so that actions (verbs) have to be set\nin motion by things (nouns), and we forget that rules of grammar are not necessarily rules, or patterns, of\nnature. This, which is nothing more than a convention of grammar, is also responsible for (or, better,\n“goeswith”) absurd puzzles as to how spirit governs matter, or mind moves body. How can a noun, which\nis by definition not action, lead to action?\nScientists would be less embarrassed if they used a language, on the model of Amerindian Nootka,\nconsisting of verbs and adverbs, and leaving off nouns and adjectives. If we can speak of a house as\nhousing, a mat as matting, or of a couch as seating, why can't we think of people as “peopling,” of brains\nas “braining,” or of an ant as an “anting?” Thus in the Nootka language a church is “housing religiously,” a\nshop is “housing tradingly,” and a home is “housing homely.” Yet we are habituated to ask, “Who or what\nis housing? Who peoples? What is it that ants?” Yet isn't it obvious that when we say, “The lightning\nflashed,” the flashing is the same as the lightning, and that it would be enough to say, “There was\nlightning”? Everything labeled with a noun is demonstrably a process or action, but language is full of\nspooks, like the “it” in “It is raining,” which are the supposed causes, of action.\nDoes it really explain running to say that “A man is running”? On the contrary, the only explanation would\nbe a description of the field or situation in which “a manning goeswith running” as distinct from one in\nwhich “a manning goeswith sitting.” (I am not recommending this primitive and clumsy form of verb\nlanguage for general and normal use. We should have to contrive something much more elegant.)\nFurthermore, running is not something other than myself, which I (the organism) do. For the organism is\nsometimes a running process, sometimes a standing process, sometimes a sleeping process, and so on,\nand in each instance the “cause” of the behavior is the situation as a whole, the organism/environment.\nIndeed, it would be best to drop the idea of causality and use instead the idea of relativity.\nFor it is still inexact to say that an organism “responds” or “reacts” to a given situation by running or\nstanding, or whatever. This is still the language of Newtonian billiards. It is easier to think of situations as\nmoving patterns, like organisms themselves. Thus, to go back to the cat (or catting), a situation with\npointed ears and whiskers at one end does not have a tail at the other as a response or reaction to the\nwhiskers, or the claws, or the fur. As the Chinese say, the various features of a situation “arise mutually”\nor imply one another as back implies front, and as chickens imply eggs—and vice versa. They exist in\nrelation to each other like the poles of the magnet, only more complexly patterned.\nMoreover, as the egg/chicken relation suggests, not all the features of a total situation have to appear at\nthe same time. The existence of a man implies parents, even though they may be long since dead, and\nthe birth of an organism implies its death. Wouldn't it be as farfetched to call birth the cause of death as\n488\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nto call the cat's head the cause of the tail? Lifting the neck of a bottle implies lifting the bottom as well, for\nthe “two parts” come up at the same time. If I pick up an accordion by one end, the other will follow a little\nlater, but the principle is the same. Total situations are, therefore, patterns in time as much as patterns in\nspace.\nAnd, right now is the moment to say that I am not trying to smuggle in the “total situation” as a new\ndisguise for the old “things” which were supposed to explain behavior or action. The total situation or\nfield is always open-ended, for\nLittle fields have big fields\nUpon their backs to bite 'em,\nAnd big fields have bigger fields\nAnd so ad infinitum.\nWe can never, never describe all the features of the total situation, not only because every situation is\ninfinitely complex, but also because the total situation is the universe. Fortunately, we do not have to\ndescribe any situation exhaustively, because some of its features appear to be much more important\nthan others for understanding the behavior of the various organisms within it. We never get more than a\nsketch of the situation, yet this is enough to show that actions (or processes) must be understood, or\nexplained, in terms of situations just as words must be understood in the context of sentences,\nparagraphs, chapters, books, libraries, and … life itself.\nTo sum up: just as no thing or organism exists on its own, it does not act on its own. Furthermore, every\norganism is a process: thus the organism is not other than its actions. To put it clumsily: it is what it does.\nMore precisely, the organism, including its behavior, is a process which is to be understood only in\nrelation to the larger and longer process of its environment. For what we mean by “understanding” or\n“comprehension” is seeing how parts fit into a whole, and then realizing that they don't compose the\nwhole, as one assembles a jigsaw puzzle, but that the whole is a pattern, a complex wiggliness, which has\nno separate parts. Parts are fictions of language, of the calculus of looking at the world through a net\nwhich seems to chop it up into bits. Parts exist only for purposes of figuring and describing, and as we\nfigure the world out we become confused if we do not remember this all the time.”\n“Investigation into Movement\n[10:51 PM, 10/17/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Malcolm (Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith) wrote:\nhttps://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=77&t=30365&p=479718&hilit=AGENT#p479718\nThere is no typing typer, no learning learner, no digesting digester, thinking tinker, or driving driver.\n489\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n...\nNo, a falling faller does not make any sense. As Nāgārjuna would put it, apart from snow that has fallen or\nhas not fallen, presently there is no falling.\n...\nIt is best if you consult the investigation into movement in the MMK, chapter two. This is where it is shown\nthat agents are mere conventions. If one claims there is agent with agency, one is claiming the agent and\nthe agency are separate. But if you claim that agency is merely a characteristic of an agent, when agent\ndoes not exercise agency, it isn't an agent since an agent that is not exercising agency is in fact a non-\nagent. Therefore, rather than agency being dependent on an agent, an agent is predicated upon\nexercising agency. For example, take movement. If there is an agent there has to be a moving mover. But\nthere is no mover when there is no moving. Apart from moving, how could there be a mover? But when\nthere is moving, there isn't a mover which is separate from moving. Even movement itself cannot be\nascertained until there has been a movement. When there is no movement, there is no agent of\nmovement. When there is moving, there is no agent of moving that can be ascertained to be separate\nfrom the moving. And since even moving cannot be ascertained without there either having been\nmovement or not, moving itself cannot be established. Since moving cannot be established, a moving\nmover cannot be established. If a moving mover cannot be established, an agent cannot be established.\n...\nUnread post by PadmaVonSamba » Thu Dec 10, 2020 11:25 pm\nIf Nagarjuna had a mirror, would he say the mirror is a different mirror each time something different is\nreflected in it, or is it the same mirror?\nDzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith:\n\"Apart from what has been mirrored and not been mirrored, there is no [present] mirroring.

Agreed? A road is designated in dependence on its\nparts, agreed? A town s designated upon its parts. Agreed?\nIf you agree to this, then you should have no problem with the following teaching of the Buddha in the\nVimalakīrtinirdeśa Sūtra:\nThis body arises from various conditions, but lacks a self. This body is like the earth, lacking an agent. This\nbody is like water, lacking a self. This body is like fire, lacking a living being. This body is like the wind,\nlacking a person. This body is like space, lacking a nature. This body is the place of the four elements, but\nis not real. This body that is not a self nor pertains to a self is empty.\nIn other words, when it comes to the conventional use of language, Buddha never rejected statements\nlike \"When I was a so and so in a past life, I did so and so, and served such and such a Buddha.\" Etc. But\nwhen it comes to what one can discern on analysis, if there is no person, no self, etc., that exists as more\nthan a mere designation, the fact that agents cannot be discerned on analysis should cause no one any\nconcern. It is merely a question of distinguishing between conventional use of language versus the insight\ninto the nature of phenomena that results from ultimate analysis.\n-------\n[11:36 PM, 10/17/2019] John Tan: Yes should put in blog together with Alan watt article about language\ncausing confusion.\n-------\nLukeinaz wrote: ↑Mon Apr 30, 2018 8:39 pm\n\"In non dual contemplation there is neither experience or experiencer.

Once it is seen through in real time\nexperientially, all appearances become naturally pellucid, transparent, crystal and pure. No amount of\neffort can bring us to this natural luminosity, it is not man-made (unconditioned).\nMirror is precisely the abstraction and the cause of all the confusions. It is as clear as daylight once it is\nseen through.

This vivid clarity is the mind's nature arising as dependent origination. So, don't look inside\nseeking the nature of awareness - it is the moon itself, rising from behind the clouds.\nIt's like this that Dōgen is able to drop body and mind, and become actualized by the myriad things. Free\nfrom knower, known and knowing itself, there is no trace of awakening - for there is no sentient being to\nbecome awakened, nor insentient rock to remain asleep.

When you understand anatta, you\nrealize awareness is like weather, it is a label to denote this luminous yet empty arising, that is pure\naggregates.\n2013 conversation with John Tan:\nJohn Tan: When you say \"weather\", does weather exist?\nSoh Wei Yu: No. It's a convention imputed on a seamless activity. Existence and non existence don't apply.\nJohn Tan: What is the basis where this label rely on?\nSoh Wei Yu: Rain clouds wind etc\nJohn Tan: Don't talk prasanga. Directly see. Rain too is a label. But in direct experience, there is no issue but\nwhen probed, you realized how one is confused about the reification from language. And from there\nlife/death/creation/cessation arise. And whole lots of attachment. But it does not mean there is no\nbasis...get it?\nSoh Wei Yu: The basis is just the experience right?\nJohn Tan: Yes which is plain and simple. When we say the weather is windy. Feel the wind, the blowing…\nBut when we look at language and mistaken verb for nouns there are big issues. So before we talk about\nthis and that. Understand what consciousness is and awareness is. Get it? When we say weather, feel the\nsunshine, the wind, the rain. You do not search for weather. Get it? Similarly, when we say awareness, look\ninto scenery, sound, tactile sensations, scents and thoughts”.\n(Note that this is still understanding emptiness from the perspective of firstfold emptiness, in secondfold\nemptiness there is nothing to ground conventions on - to be elaborated in the chapter on Stage 6).\n“24 Jun `06, 1:37PM\n496\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThusness\nCog\nThe weather as Pristine Awareness\nLook! The formation of the cloud, the rain, the color of the sky, the thunder, all these entirety that is\ntaking place, what is it? It is Pristine Awareness. Not identify with anything, not bounded within the body,\nfree from defintion and experience what is it. It is the entire field of our pristine awareness taking place\nwith its emptiness nature.\nIf we fall back to 'Self', we are enclosed within. First we must go beyond symbols and see behind the\nessence that takes place. Master this art until the factor of enlightenment arises and stablizes, the 'self'\nsubsides and the ground reality without core is understood. ” – John Tan, 2006\nA Conversation with Someone who Realized Anatta\nThroughout the years, I have encountered many who have realised anatta after encountering AtR materials.\nHere is an example of a conversation with someone who realised anatta after many years in the I AM phase.\nThe following conversation took place in Dharma Overground back in 2011:\nSeraph Tai:\nI was reading the text on integral psychotherapy and transpersonal identity development, and while\nreading the notions about the Nondual, it happened.\nThose notions are worth mentioning, I think:\nin Kashmir Shivaism, they outline ancient guidelines about obstacles to ultimate reality, so called malas\n(impurities):\n- anava mala (belief that any given person occupies particular space, i.e. I am here not there, and certainly\nnot everywhere)\n- mayiya mala (belief that there are other objects outside of us, i.e. Jane is out there, not here where I am\nlocated)\nBasically that is the root perception of false ego, the illusory center of reference.\nBy that time, Nondual was already here (only seeing the seen, hearing the sound etc...), it seems the first\ntwo malas were recognized as false straight away.\nIt is important to note that I was at that point able to switch back to \"I am\" presence, perceiving the well\nknown Omnipresence of my True self. For years I entered this state at will, hence falling back to the \"I am\"\npresence was happening, I guess.\nIt was different this time, however: I realized with the so called aha! moment, that the I am presence is\nexactly the same as the \"sensory input\" I was experiencing. The seen, sensed, cognized AS the \"I am\"\npresence - only that \"I am\" presence was not there anymore. I was however, able to switch, back and forth,\nso to speak. Maybe it is worth mentioning that the Nondual was/is (still is) more liberating and peaceful\nthan \"I am\" presence insight.\n497\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nWhat sealed the deal, so to speak LOL, was:\n- karma mala - belief that a person must perform an action, do something to remedy any given situation,\nsay \"I need to meditate to get enlightened\"\nIt happened few moments after I read that notion, and everything just became crystal clear, no switching\nback to \"I am\" presence, there was no one here, there, anywhere to switch to!! And I am not talking only\nabout the little false ego, I am also talking about the ultimate \"I am\" presence! For years, I was happy to\nabide as a Witness, Omnipresent and liberated, free from mental/emotional/physical bullshit.\nBut now, the \"I am\" presence was gone!! Even the so called Unmanifested \"I am\" was nowhere to be found\n(the Causal level has two sub-levels, lower (I am presence, the Witness) and higher (No \"I am\", just the\nUnmanifested, latent absolute potential), according to Wilber).\nIt seems that after years of entering satori at will, I was allowed to move on.\nOnly there isn't anyone to give the permission, or anyone to be allowed to move on. No one is here, it never\nwas, it can not exist, because events are unfolding by their own, on their own. Phenomena is free, separated\nfrom every other phenomena, not touching but liberating as they come and go.\nI can enter into Nondual at will now, especially after the shared experience. Driving the car, eating, looking\nout the window - it seems that these situations are easy and do not require much mental effort on my part,\nso I can easily let go.\nWhat I also notice now is that I can discern the Advaita texts from the Nondual ones.\nTo my saddness, I realized that my favorite master, Sri Ramana Maharshi, is not speaking about Anatta, or\nnot even about Nondual (as far as I can see), He mentions that even in Sahaja Nirbikalpa Samadhi (the\nultimate state, according to Him) there is \"something\" there which mediator is at One with. Well, He must\nbe talking about something different, not about Anatta or Nondual.\nAnatta I can enter almost at will now, but it usually just slips back to the Nondual insight, with slight\nresemblance of something here, traces or tendencies from years of \"I am\" presence samadhis, I guess.\n\"An Eternal Now (Soh):\nWhat is your view about what consciousness is now? Does consciousness have any characteristics of being\nunchanging, independent or etc and if not what is it?\"\nWell, now I view consciousness as non-local, not centered in the \"I am presence\" anymore, there is no split\nbetween samadhi and everyday life, in a sense that there is no one to make that distinction. I am more at\npeace now, more at ease, laid back so to speak.\n498\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nYes, at the moment, I see the consciousness as something free, liberating in itself, \"changing\" by itself:\nevents come and go by themselves, no one is in control, so to speak, no one to instigate coming and going,\nnot even God.\nAnd, I promise you, for me this notion ( there is no God, as a separate entity or Absolute Self etc... )is rather\ndramatic change.\nI am still not clear why events or phenomena are perceived as coming and going. What is condition (\"yuan\"\nas per Thusness) for events to occur? What is yuan?\n\"An Eternal Now (Soh):\nHow stable is your non dual experiencing now? Also I presume you have read Thusness's articles in our\nblog? One more thing: any changes in your sleep and dream?\"\nI have read most of Thusness' articles at your blog, yes. But I don't get everything yet, especially about the\nSunyata insights.\nHow stable is my Nondual experiencing now? I don't know what is the criteria for stability, but I can enter\nNondual at will, it is easiest to do, as there is no effort needed (apart from letting go) or something gained.\nWhen everything is let go of, the Nondual remains, not as a state or level, but as base reality. No need to\ndo anything, as it already and alone is.\nAll of this, it is not spontaneous yet, though.\nIt is interesting you should mention sleep (dreamless one, I suppose) and dreams.\nLucid dreaming is an important part of my sadhana, I have been dreaming lucidly (on and off) for years.\nThe change I am noticing for a few years is that all three states (waking, dreams and dreamless sleep) are\nhappening to Me, the base Reality, they are happening in Me, so to speak (actually, everything else,\neverything, is happening in Me, as a part of my Being). Even in dreaming I am aware of this, not as in classic\nlucid dreaming sense but more profound. It is like common denominator, silver lining in all three states, so\nto speak.\nDoes that make any sense, pls?\nBut now even this has changed as I know beyond the shadow of the doubt that there is no Me as the base\nreality.\nIt is a process, I think, so I look forward to experiencing new insights.\nThank you.\ns.\n499\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSoh Wei Yu replied:\nGood insights there Seraphis! You seem able to actualize the living experience of anatta without dwelling\nmuch into view. Your insights unfold from recognizing \"the same taste\" of I AM in all six entries and exits,\ninto seeing that the very idea of abiding is a hindrance, to the doubtless realization that there never was a\n\"This I\" to abide in, and whatever arises is already free and liberating.\nThere are similarities with my experience but somewhat different triggers. I had an intense non-dual\nexperience (Aug '10) when dancing at a nightclub that totally dissolved the Witness for a few days (after\nwhich I was switching between I AM and non-dual for a period of time due to previous practice tendencies\nlike you until clearer insights), before this event non-dual glimpses was occassional, few, short and\nintermittent but after this event I was able to 'switch' into non-dual mode with relative ease as my insight\ninto Awareness/Existence was refined from \"I AM pure Existence\" to \"Existence is the very stuff of whatever\narises\". Soon I was also contemplating and challenging the sense of subject-object, inside-outside, border\nand boundaries of awareness and manifestation, etc until it was all seen as seamless awareness (one mind).\nThen non-dual was pretty clear to me. Later during October 2010 I wrote two articles in reference to my\ninsights, first on One Taste and then it was contemplating on the Bahiya Sutta about a week later that\ntriggered the clear insight into anatta/\"No I\": http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2010/10/one-taste.html\nand https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html .\nFor now, you should not be distracted with stages of insights (sunyata or whatever) but be thorough and\nleave no trace of \"I\" for the willingness to let go completely (the I) has arisen. Check this out if you haven't:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2011/11/where-there-is-no-cold-or-heat_27.html\n(Nov 27 Where There Is No Cold or Heat\nA monk asked Tozan, “When cold and heat come, how can we avoid them?”\nTozan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nThe monk said, “What is the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nTozan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you; when it’s hot, the heat kills you.”\nThis is not advice to “accept” your situation, as some commentators have suggested, but a direct\nexpression of authentic practice and enlightenment. Master Tozan is not saying, “When cold, shiver; when\nhot, sweat,” nor is he saying, “When cold, put on a sweater; when hot, use a fan.” In the state of authentic\npractice and enlightenment, the cold kills you, and there is only cold in the whole universe. The heat kills\nyou, and there is only heat in the whole universe. The fragrance of incense kills you, and there is only the\nfragrance of incense in the whole universe. The sound of the bell kills you, and there is only “boooong” in\nthe whole universe…\n~The Flatbed Sutra of Louie Wing, Ted Biringer\n500\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSoh: Also see, The place where there is no earth, fire, wind, space, water)\nNext step is not to stagnate in no-self and engage wholly and completely into actions and activities then\n\"satori\" has no entry or exit; when the thunder claps, the whole of \"satori\" is actualized!\nNafis Rahman's Breakthrough to Anatta\nNafis Rahman wrote:\nNot sure what stage this is, just sharing from personal experience. Will try to be as clear as possible.\nFor the past 2 months, I focused mainly on somatic techniques due to having an energy imbalance. Very\nlimited contemplation or formal meditation.\nWhen I walk, there is just the sensation of my feet touching the hard floor. When hearing a song on\nYoutube, it’s just hearing the sound itself without any kind of internal interference. Sometimes I even re-\ndevelop an energy imbalance while listening to music. There’s no need for a “hearer” to hear for me, but\nit’s actually happening in real-time rather than merely theoretically.\nAny concept of anything absolute or unchanging no longer exists. I used to believe in God, but it\ndisappeared as well. There’s no need for a separate awareness, and through practicing the exercises in\nSeeing that Frees and Clarifying the Natural State I know firsthand that the self never existed in the first\nplace. It was all a self-deception.\nI’ve had no-mind experiences in the past, but since it’s been stable for over 1 month, I think the insight\nhas fully developed. However I still have thoughts, emotions, and get absent-minded. The world around\nme still feels very much physical. After practicing some of the emptiness exercises, I have weird visions\nand hallucinations, like objects have no boundary surrounding it. But still working on it, so ignore this\nsection.\nSometimes the world seems “flat” like everything is 2D or a painting, but again, I’m not confident in\nanything beyond anatta. Or that the colors of each object start mixing together like a wet painting.\nI feel like I can make everyday experience even more direct, that the directness of how everything is\nperceived can be increased. However when I do so, I experience pressure around my third eye. If I try to\ndelve into sensations even more it spreads to the crown chakra. Even with anatta I feel there are phases\nin terms of how directly everything is perceived by the 5 senses. But again, it’s difficult to go further at\npresent.\nSoh told John Tan:\n[12:39 PM, 10/7/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I asked him to read clarifying the natural state two months ago\n(Further comments by Soh: not the first time I heard of someone attaining insights just by reading\nthrough this book, so this is recommended reading, along with The Royal Seal of Mahamudra: Volume\nOne: A Guidebook for the Realization of Coemergence: 1. And as I told Nafis, if you are interested in\n501\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMahamudra or Dzogchen, find a good teacher in these lineages.)\n[12:39 PM, 10/7/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Back then he hasn't realised anatta. Only no mind\nJohn Tan replied:\n[12:40 PM, 10/7/2020] John Tan: Like I said yesterday, even anatta there are several phases.\n[12:41 PM, 10/7/2020] John Tan: Anatta as in the experiential insight of seeing through self and seeing\nthrough the cause for the sense of self is different.\n[12:48 PM, 10/7/2020] John Tan: The later path one towards emptiness realizing \"inherency\" is the result\nof a reification. One then progress through deconstructing the reification thoroughly and gain the prajna\n(wisdom) that not only sees through directly the mental constructs and conventionalities but also the\ndirect knowledge of one's empty clarity.\n[1:01 PM, 10/7/2020] John Tan: Don't rush post anatta or even no-mind but refine one's view.\nNevertheless it is hard not to get energy imbalances initially which is due attachment of going after\ncertain experiences.\nThe sense of self/Self or any sense of it-ness is a hindrance for natural spontaneity and therefore\nthorough exhaustion is necessary. However maturing this emptiness of \"it-ness or self-ness\" post anatta\nis an ongoing process. Deeply held blindspots are slippery and extremely difficult to see and can take\ndecades to reveal.\nSo practice calmly and evenly...don't rush into anything...\nJust relax and be fully open to whatever arises without dual, don't go after anything and keep refining\nview instead of chasing after experiences. Eventually the clarity of seeing through will automatically\nresult in the everyday experiences.\n[1:13 PM, 10/7/2020] John Tan: Without dual and without self\nNafis Rahman wrote:\nThanks! Yeah John Tan is completely right, I was too busy chasing after the experience itself rather than\nfocusing on view. Right now I'm focused on gently deconstructing emptiness and dependent origination.\nShould I focus on theoretical books instead or continue with this current practice?\nJohn Tan replied:\n[1:18 PM, 10/7/2020] John Tan: Just continue with current practice. Allow the whole body mind to become\na sensing organ, vibrantly alive and intimately connected with the ten thousand things!\nNafis Rahman wrote to someone else:\n502\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nTotally Random thoughts, not sure it will be that helpful…\nI had experiences of anatta (just sound, touch, smell) in the past that lasted over 3 days, and thought this\nwas it! But the sense of self always came back although significantly weakened, and there was a subtle\nclinging to God or some kind of cosmic force.\nPersonally, I had to approach the self from multiple angles, really explore how it manifested in the mind\nin relation to the Thusness stanzas and everyday experience. For example, when hearing sound, why is\nthere a necessity for a hearer to hear for me, rather than just hearing directly? Why go through this\nunnecessary loop of “hearer is hearing a sound”? Even for thinking, why should this separate thinker think\nfor me? Thoughts are still happening regardless, better to just kick this thinker out of my head!\nGoing through the ebook from I Am all the way to Anatta (don’t touch stage 6) really helped in terms of\nview. Especially the difference between one-mind, no-mind, or void in terms of direct experience. The\nbook Crystal Clear by Thrangu Rinpoche really provided the tools and the trigger to just smash this self\ninto pieces until you realize you’re just hitting empty air. But it’s not immediately obvious, so some\npatience is necessary. Especially being radically honest with oneself about one’s insights and experience.\nAlways remain self-critical. I probably spent 2 weeks after the “realization” just reading Advaita books to\nchallenge this breakthrough as much as possible.\nThis is an article by Soh that I found helpful: Different Degress of No-Self: Non-Doership, Non-dual,\nAnatta, Total Exertion and Dealing with Pitfalls (I kept on clinging to non-doership in earlier phases)\nAnatta and the Emptiness of Awareness is Not a Denial of Awareness/Clarity\nAlthough Awareness is seen to not seen to exist in and of its own (its nature is empty), it is not a denial of\nAwareness/Clarity. See: No Awareness Does Not Mean Non-Existence of Awareness\n“Geovani Geo to me, to be without dual is not to subsume into one and although awareness is negated, it\nis not to say there is nothing.\nNegating the Awareness/Presence (Absolute) is not to let Awareness remain at the abstract level. When\nsuch transpersonal Awareness that exists only in wonderland is negated, the vivid radiance of presence\nare fully tasted in the transient appearances; zero gap and zero distance between presence and moment\nto moment of ordinary experiences and we realize separation has always only been conventional.\nThen mundane activities -- hearing, sitting, standing, seeing and sensing, become pristine and vibrant,\nnatural and free.” – John Tan, 2020\n“Buddhism does not deny luminous clarity, in fact it is to have total, uncontrived, direct non-referential\n[experience] of clarity in all moments… therefore no-self apart from manifestation. Otherwise one is only\nholding ghost images.” - John Tan, 2013\n“...dissolve the self in the incredible realness of the phenomenon world… When someone ask zen masters\n503\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nwhat is buddha's nature.... it’s the tile, rocks… feel the hardness, jumps… it is exactly that. Experience\nanything… everything…” - John Tan, 2006\n“When you present to 不思 (Soh: a forummer in China), you must not deny 觉 (awareness). But emphasize\nhow 覺 (awareness) is effortlessly and marvelously manifests without the slightest sense of referencing and\npoint of centricity and duality and subsuming… be it here, now, in, out… this can only come from realization\nof anatta, dependent origination and emptiness so that the spontaneity of 相 (appearance) is realized to\none's radiance clarity.” - John Tan, 2014\n[12:42 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: This pristine, clean, transparent quality is always there, otherwise there is\nno cognition nor manifestation. When there is no conceptual thoughts, it is obvious...when covered with\nmental thoughts, it is not that obvious but all manifestations are pervaded with this taste...\n[12:43 AM, 8/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[12:43 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: It is be quite obvious to you...\n[12:43 AM, 8/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: yeah\n[12:44 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: In fact, it should already pervade your entire body mind.\n[12:44 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: Otherwise you wouldnt understand and feel like a ball of radiance light...\n[12:46 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: Whether hearing sound, seeing colors, tasting or feeling sensations, this\nluminous radiance is always there as presence.\n[12:47 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: Like now you are hearing sound, there is that quality...\n[12:48 AM, 8/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Yeah..\n[12:49 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: In anatta, since all 6 senses become transparent and pure, entire body-\nmind becomes transparent and pristine...\n[12:57 AM, 8/18/2020] John Tan: So one should not separate this transparent, pristine quality as if it is\nsomething separate from manifestation. The radiance is naturally pristine and crystal, no polishing needed.\nNor can one distance from it.\n“The Transient Universe has a Heart\nDogen on the Heart of Tiles:\nIf we belittle tiles as being lumps of clay, we will also belittle people as being lumps of clay. If people\nhave a Heart, then tiles too will have a Heart.\nShobogenzo, Kokyo, Hubert Nearman\nI mentioned earlier that I will write something about dull nondual experience and realising the Presence or\nthe Heart.\nThere is something tremendously alive, intelligent, a quality of pure Presence and that is nothing inert but\nintensely luminous (not in the sutric definition of purity and emptiness) but in the sense that the intensity\n504\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nof our cognizant mind evokes the sense of powerful radiance and illumination but without any separation\nbetween an illuminator and the illuminated, with absolutely no agent/perceiver/doer involved. It can evoke\nthe sense of a radiance that is so intense that it completely outshines all visual darkness of night and\nbrightness of the sun. This Presence is mystically alive, wondrous and magnificent, “more real than real”,\nand the complete opposite of an inert or merely some dull state of non conceptuality and absorption.\nThis outshining of Presence-Awareness is not about some hidden invisible background existing behind\nmanifestation (although it will be perceived this way at the I AM stage) but is vividly manifest or “Presencing”\n(Presencing is a better word than Presence as it is not a static background or entity and none other than\nthe dynamic stuff of transience) as the very “realness” or “vividness” of any appearance/display, color,\nsound, scent, touch, taste, thought, as if everything comes alive and there is something very wonderful and\nbeautiful about it. The brilliant light of Presence-Awareness is none other than the body-mind-universe\nwhich when deconstructed and freed from self/Self/physicality is experienced as spheres of vivid light,\ncolors, sounds, and sensations.\nThis luminosity is also not merely a heightened state of clarity as I explained:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/…/luminosity-vs-clar…\n“Someone asked me about luminosity. I said it is not simply a state of heightened clarity or mindfulness,\nbut like touching the very heart of your being, your reality, your very essence without a shadow of doubt.\nIt is a radiant, shining core of Presence-Awareness, or Existence itself. It is the More Real than Real. It can\nbe from a question of \"Who am I?\" followed by a sudden realization. And then with further insights you\ntouch the very life, the very heart, of everything. Everything comes alive. First as the innermost 'You', then\nlater when the centerpoint is dropped (seen through -- there is no 'The Center') every 'point' is equally so,\nevery point is A 'center', in every encounter, form, sound and activity.”\n“[3/8/19, 5:06:41 PM] John Tan: Yes. That (More real than real) is also an insight that turns the mind internal.\nThat (More real than real) comes with I AMness. The difference between anatta and substantiality is [that]\nbeside appearance, there is [an] innate feeling of some essence separate from the appearances of colors,\nsensations, sound, smell, taste and thoughts. Therefore one cannot be fully open and release.”\nThere is a wide variety of methods to bring oneself to an abrupt stoppage of concepts and a face to face\nencounter of Pure Presence. All sorts of ways actually, some are safer and some are a bit more risky. For\nexample John (John Tan), I, Ramana Maharshi, Ch'an Master Hsu Yun and many others have awakened\nthrough self-enquiry and we are exponents of the method of self-enquiry. Sim Pern Chong awakened to\nthe I AM through breath meditation. Some get awakened through a mere pointing out by a teacher. Some\nawakened through yogic, tantric, kundalini paths. Some have realised it spontaneously with no prior\nspiritual practices in a near death experience (see the books and cases of Anita Moorjani and Maren\nSpringsteen). Ram Dass, David Carse and others have had their initial realization of the Heart-essence\n505\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nthrough the use of psychedelic drugs like magic mushrooms, ayahuasca, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, and so on. (I am\nnot advocating the use of drugs here as they come with legality issues and some risks, just stating that\nsome people have used them with such results. Personally, all my major realisations and breakthroughs\nhappened sober during meditative contemplation. For more details on psychedelics, refer to Psychedelics\nand Buddhist Practice?) There are many other methods and koans I did not mention.\nAnd yet, many have awakened through a simple shout by a Zen Master or a Dzogchen Master. A sudden\nunexpected KATZ! or a PHAT! of a Zen and Dzogchen master brings one into the immediate thoughtless\nface-to-face encounter of the luminous heart-essence. At that moment, you just shift out from all that\nnonsense and garbage in your head into just that instance of being blanked out into Presence. It is not an\ninert trance but an alert, alive and yet thoughtless state of Presence. Try it!\nBut whatever method one uses to introduce that initial glimpse and taste of Presence, it is always through\nthe deepening of insight into non-dual anatta that brings that taste to effortless uncontrivance and full-\nblown maturity in all encounters and manifestations.\nSo when one has access to a state of nondual, one should ask whether it is dull and inert or suffused with\na powerful sense of Presence. After anatta this Presence is no longer seen as a background but vividly\nshining forth as the manifold dynamic and seamlessly interconnected display, and the play of dharma and\ndependent origination is something which is alive, not just inert and mechanistic as someone wrote. All the\nqualities of I AM - infinite like space, powerful Presence, Luminosity, Clarity, Vitality and Intelligence are\neffortlessly experienced without contrivance, and furthermore no longer seen as something hidden behind\nbut fully manifested from moment to moment activity and the sense of cosmic Impersonality which was\nonce experienced as being lived through a reified cosmic intelligence is now experienced as the total\nexertion where a single activity is the exertion of the Whole - an activity that is seamlessly connected and\ncoordinated with the entire Whole, a spontaneous exertion of the Whole of seamless dependencies. In\nother words all the taste of Presence similar to the I AM, including all the four aspects of I AM and the\nexperience of anatta as requisites are fully present in the experience of Maha suchness in each single\nmanifest experience even as simple and ordinary as a breath, and Maha suchness is an experience of\ngreatness beyond measure, such that a single breath, a single step forward while walking feels cosmic and\nlimitless.\n\"The purpose of anatta is to have full blown experience of the heart -- boundlessly, completely, non-dually\nand non-locally. Re-read what I wrote to Mr. J.\nIn every situations, in all conditions, in all events. It is to eliminate unnecessary contrivity so that our essence\ncan be expressed without obscuration.\n506\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMr. J wants to point to the heart but is unable to express in a non-dual way... for in duality, the essence\ncannot be realized. All dualistic interpretation are mind made. You know the smile of Mahākāśyapa? Can\nyou touch the heart of that smile even 2500 yrs later?\nOne must lose all mind and body by feeling with entire mind and body this essence which is 心 (Mind). Yet\n心 (Mind) too is 不可得 (ungraspable/unobtainable).. The purpose is not to deny 心 (Mind) but rather not to\nplace any limitations or duality so that 心 (Mind) can fully manifest.\nTherefore without understanding 缘 (conditions)，is to limit 心 (Mind). without understanding 缘\n(conditions)，is to place limitation in its manifestations. You must fully experience 心 (Mind) by realizing\n无心 (No-Mind) and fully embrace the wisdom of 不可得 (ungraspable/unobtainable).\" - John Tan, 2014” -\nSoh, 2019\n“I do not generally advise on psychedelic use (I do not tell people they should or should not do it - it must\ncome from their own discernment of its pros and cons, risks and benefits, personal appetite for risk\ntaking and adventurousness, legality issues pertaining to where the person lives, etc). But generally those\nwho have gone through anatta and maturing of anatta report that psychedelic experiences pale in\ncomparison. The experience of anatta luminosity and total exertion can be so intense that by focusing in\na wrong way, one can end up with energy issues, so one must thread with care (imagine a 24/7\npsychedelic trip that never ends although you weren't on any drugs, you can't sleep, headaches, etc - that\nhappened to me for about a week until I resolved it).\nFrank Yang is one of those who said his \"4th path\" trumps all his psychedelic experiences. I too have said\nsimilarly, and many others as well: Mr RDT:\n\"Completele lack of any artificialness - though the intensity of clarity and vividness dwarfed anything that I\nhave ever experienced on psychedelics xD (though without HPPD or hallucinations) or with meditation\nbefore.\"\nMy own report: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../the-magical...\nAF Richard's report:\nRICHARD: To illustrate what a life of total fulfilment and utter satisfaction looks like I will quote from a\nbook by one of the three ‘positive psychologists’ you refer to:\n• ‘One summer day, 40 years ago or so, I was walking along a residential street when an rich, earthy scent\nwafted my way and triggered, as smells are wont to do, a vivid recollection. Like Dorothy, stepping out of\nher front door into the Technicolor Land of Oz, I remembered another summer’s day when I was 4 years\n507\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nold, playing in a bank of warm, black dirt in the back yard of my home. I had a little red toy car for which\nI’d made a road slanting up the face of the dirt bank and, in my recollection, I was ‘driving’ the car up this\nmountain road while making motor noises. That’s all there was, no real action, yet the memory, in the few\nseconds before it faded away, was redolent with the smell and feel of the warm dirt, the bright colour of\nthe toy, the hot sun – with simple but intensely pleasurable sensory experience. When I read Aldous\nHuxley’s account of his mescaline experience, of his feeling that the colours, shapes, and textures of his\nbooks on the shelves across the room were as intense an experience as he could bear and that he dared\nnot look outside at the flowers in the garden, I thought of my brief revisitation of my childhood.\nPresumably this intensity of sensory experience does fade, when it’s work of facilitating perceptual\nlearning is accomplished, because it would be maladaptive in adults. Those ancients who sat around all\nday entranced by colours, smells, and textures, would have never gotten the venison cooked nor the\nberries picked; they would have been easy meat for prowling tigers and unlikely to become ancestors’.\n(Chapter 1, ‘Happiness: The Nature and Nurture of Joy and Contentment’; David Lykken).\n(http://www.psych.umn.edu/.../Lykken/HapChap%201.htm...).\nIn short: life here in this actual world *is* such an intense experience, each moment again, as the intense\nexperience he describes (a PCE lasting a few seconds 40 years ago) yet despite his well-explained\n(referencing Mr. Aldous Huxley’s account) glimpse of the perfection of the purity of this actual world (as\nexperienced when 4 years old) he opts instead for the ‘life satisfaction’ of positive psychology ... all the\nwhile presuming, with spurious justifications, that this life I am living is ‘maladaptive in adults’.\nYet I am neither in gaol nor a psychiatric institution; I can orient myself in space and time and get from\npoint A to point B; I am not easy meat for prowlers; I feed, clothe and house myself, paying all my bills on\ntime; I manage four net-worked computers, an internet domain, a web page, a mail server, and so on,\nwithout any prior experience or training; I write millions of words meaningfully strung together in\nsentences and paragraphs ... all the while ‘entranced by colours, smells, and textures’ to an extent much,\nmuch more than a PCE allows (as evidenced by Mr. Aldous Huxley not being able to bear it for example).\nNeed I say more about what the value of his ‘80% of Americans report ...’ survey is worth?\n*” – Soh, 2021\n\"I was actually just thinking about this the other day. My current moment to moment experience has\nbeen of intense clarity, very much like when I have used psychedelics in the past. It is more ordered\nhowever. There was always a sort of non-natural feel to the psychedelic experiences. This feels totally\nnatural. As for where it seems looking is coming from, that changes all the time. There is no specific\ncenter. Sometimes it feels like looking out the eyes for a moment, then it will change the next moment to\nbeing aware of the whole scene, then switch to being aware of some mental image overlaid on the whole\nscene universe. Sometimes it feels like existing in a more than 3-dimensional way. As I release more and\nmore into the non-dual, dependently originated, lack of mind, total exertion view of reality, new\nexperiences open up that I wouldn't have even dreamed were possible. These experiences are certainly\nnot the point or at all a refuge like I used to want them to be. If I try to hold onto them at all I squash\nthem. I mostly try to just study them gently and refine my view to release more into anatta/total exertion.\n508\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nIf I had taken a drug that pushed my experience into what I have naturally today, I would have likely been\noverwhelmed. There was too much grasping then to really go with it.\" - Jayson MPaul, 2021\n“Session Start: Saturday, 27 March, 2010\n(9:54 PM) Thusness: Not bad for self-enquiry\n(9:55 PM) AEN: icic.. btw what do you think lucky and chandrakirti is trying to convey\n(9:56 PM) Thusness: those quotes weren't really well translated in my opinion. what needs be understood\nis 'No I' is not to deny Witnessing consciousness. and 'No Phenomena' is not to deny Phenomena.

In Phase 5, not\nonly is the sense of ‘small ego’ or ‘sense of individuality’ dissolved, even the sense of being a metaphysical\n512\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSelf, an ultimate, changeless, transcendental Subject is being seen through, dissolved and made irrelevant\nthrough insight, even though the Presence/Presencing and unfabricated Clarity is not denied but ‘made’\ntotal, uncontrived, direct and non-referential (as mentioned in the previous section).\nRelinquishing one aspect self does not mean other aspects of self/Self has been dissolved. Stage 5 is the\nthorough dissolution of the many faces of self/Self through deep experiential insight. Someone may\nexperience non-doership and think it is the same as the Stage 5 realization of anatta, but in fact it isn’t.\nSome people may experience impersonality (see: four aspects of I AM above)… non-dual (as in stage 4)…\nand think of it as anatta. But it isn’t the same.\n“Phase 5 is quite thorough in being no one and I would call this anatta in all 3 aspects -- no subject/object\ndivision, no doer-ship and absence of agent.”\n~ John Tan, 2009\nAll phenomena happening by itself spontaneously and causally (via dependent origination) on its own,\nwithout the sense of doership or control, is not what I call anatta realization. This is so even if one has the\nexperience of impersonality, being lived by the divine or cosmic life and intelligence as a divine happening.\nYou can trigger an insight or experience into non-doership by asking yourself: do you know what your next\nmoment of thought or experience is, or does it just happen? Then by observing your experience, you see\nthat all thoughts and experience just happens spontaneously on its own accord, unbidden.\nIf you are still unsure of non-doership, read this article by Greg Goode:\nhttps://www.nonduality.com/goode.htm\nIn the case of mere non-doership and impersonality, the subject/object paradigm is still present, and\nalthough one feels that phenomena happens on its own, the sense of being an observer watching things\nhappening on its own is still present. This is not what I call the realization of anatta, in fact it is not even\nnon-dual realization yet.\nMany people that I’ve seen, including those who went through no-self contemplations of Liberation\nUnleashed, are talking about an experience of non-doership. They have not reached non-dual realization\nyet. And because they have not realized Presence, their next phase of progression became self-enquiry and\nI AM realization. This is a valid progression, but not to mistake that as the ultimate or final realization. The\nI AM must later be brought to the foreground and anatta (as defined in this guide) should be realized by\nseeing through the reified background.\n2009:\n“(12:54 AM) Thusness: you are also have not clearly experienced non-dual\n513\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(12:56 AM) AEN: like ok, if I heard a loud BOOM suddenly I feel fear and my body contract... its\ndependently originated and theres no doer. is that what you mean?\n(8:07 AM) Thusness: No. you must clearly understand what is meant by no doer. it is really this witness\nyou are talking about without the tendency of reifying anything.

The\nOne Life, the one consciousness that pervades the entire universe and takes temporary form to\nexperience itself as a stone or blade of grass, as an animal, a person, a star or a galaxy.\nCan you sense deep within that you already know that? Can you sense that you already are That?\"\n(2:25 PM) Thusness: This One Life is same to you as well as me. This is a very subtle extrapolation. But\nexperientially it does appears so. It has a lot to do with the spontaneous arising and impersonality\n(deconstruction of personality). Therefore when one focus and refine the 4 aspects I spoke about without\neven arising the insight of non-dual, one can still lead to such an experience. This is stage 2. Get it?\nFurther to that one will want to penetrate into 3. Re-read phase one to 3. Phase 4 is strictly non-dual.\nThough non-dual, still having inherent view.

That is One Mind\n(2:40 PM) AEN: The \"vision\" of truth appears new because it was not noticed before. Whatever we are and\nthe world is, is already the fact. There is no attainment involved in being what you are. That is the\nconstant space of life, awareness or being in which all appears. It includes silence and sound, activity and\nstillness, form and emptiness, knowledge and ignorance, and all other dualities and opposites. Your\nnatural condition is not a state within the appearances but the spacious heart of reality which contains\nand embraces them all. It is like a bright mirror in which diverse reflections rise and set. The mirror\nremains as it is and bears no relation to the presence or absence of its reflections. The mirror cannot be\n514\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nlimited by or identified with any of the reflections appearing in it, nor does it grasp or resist them. For\ntheir part, the reflections have no substance or independent nature apart from the mirror. In the same\nway, all that is, was or ever will be is contained in the timeless light of your true nature. The strange and\nwonderful thing is that this has always been so.\nIf this is not noticed, it gets pointed out and recognized, and the true perspective is restored. It is as\nsimple as that. - john wheeler\nthis is like One Mind?\n(2:47 PM) Thusness: In phase 4, a practitioner will be obsessed with this substratum in a non-dual context.\nYou must understand phase 5-7 is refining the insight of the same experience of 4. You so clearly see that\nnon-dual is implicit as there never is any agent apart from the ongoing phenomenality. Then you realized\nthe true meaning of anatta and emptiness and move from disassociation to self liberation. Seems like\ntalking to different practitioners help you understand the 7 phases but don't make it as an absolute\nmodel.”\nFound an old post i wrote in my e-journal days after my anatta awakening in 2010 where i distinguished\nimpersonality from anata:\n17th October 2010\nOriginally posted by An Eternal Now:\nUpdate: Oh and regarding 'On the othe hand, feeling ‘universe’ has to do with the deconstruction of\n‘identity’ and ‘personality’. You have to have clearer insight of what ‘deconstructions’ leads to what\nexperience.' - it's my experience that dropping personality leads to experiencing Awareness as not an\nindividual or personal presence but a Universal Awareness sustaining and containing all lives and forms...\nThere is a sense of an all pervading Awareness that does not belong to any particular person or object\nbut sustains them. At this point, Awareness is still treated as a background, but it is now seen as the\nSource and Ground of all beings and things... not a personal presence.\nHowever... the non-dual aspect is different as it is no longer 'Universal Awareness' but 'Awareness is the\nUniverse'. There is simply the universe manifesting this moment as a pure nondual consciousness\nexperience... Consciousness/Awareness is this arising sound, sight, thought, etc. Awareness AS Universe...\nno longer Universal Awareness. This part requires dissolving the sense of an ultimate background\nidentity, the Big Self of Universal Awareness...\nThusness:\nGreat insight!\nHowever you are still not clear about where exactly the questions are leading you. Think deeper and\nunderstand what I told you in msn. I got to go now.\nNon-doership is just one of the aspects of anatta, by itself it is not the anatta realization. (Thusness Stage\n5: \"...Phase 5 is quite thorough in being no one and I would call this anatta in all 3 aspects -- no\nsubject/object division, no doer-ship and absence of agent...\") One can experience non-doership during\nthe I AM phase, or for some people even before the I AM realization. Hence non-doership is not\nequivalent with anatta realization.\n515\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAlthough the aspect of non-doership itself does not indicate the realization of anatta, this does not mean\nit is not important. Particularly, non-doership becomes clearly experienced when the John Tan's first\nstanza of anatta is penetrated and clearly realised. However, the first stanza of anatta is not merely non-\ndoership, as explained in the conversation below. The first stanza of anatta conveys both absence of\nagent and non-doership, and not just non-doership. Commenting on someone's breakthrough, John Tan\nsaid, \"More towards second stanza [of anatta], non-doership is equally important.\" and on someone else,\n\"Non-dual but can't discern clearly the difference between conventionalities and ultimate. Did it talk\nabout natural spontaneity? [In] The 2 stanzas of anatta, the non-doership will lead to natural spontaneity.\nCurrently it is talking about freedom from observer and observed, but the second part of realising\nappearances are just empty clarity isn't there. Therefore effortlessness of vivid presence will not be\npossible without these 2 insights as base.\"\nSession Start: Saturday, March 07, 2009\n(1:47 AM) AEN: i just read kiloby's article on no doer... his anatta insight is mostly on the Stanza 1\nrite?\nhttps://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kiloby.com%2Fkiloby2homecorrect_0\n20.htm&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C38257fcf79a54b61ba8008d8b336ea2a%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaa\naaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637456395719910027%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAi\nLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=pfLlAw1L6uc%2FxvLt6y2DQIg\nJIJHr72zGbmq7MNhudXc%3D&amp;reserved=0\n(1:49 AM) AEN: i tink wat he said is like wat you said in stanza 1... except that its more on\nspontaneous arising but without mentioning conditions\n(1:50 AM) AEN: actually he did mention conditioning a bit also\n(1:52 AM) Thusness: yes more on that but only the no doership. not seeing that there is no agent as a\nphenomena. and not seeing DO\n(1:53 AM) AEN: oic..\nwhat do you mean 'no agent as a phenomena.'\n(1:54 AM) Thusness: means seeing there is no agent, that is without the subject in experience. than there\nis no controller, no co-ordinator, no agent that links. means on phenomena. not only doership. that there\nis no agent and phenomena. only phenomena exist. get it? that is different from no doership. means one,\njust that doing. means seeing the actual phenomena that there is no agent, just phenomena. get it?\n(1:57 AM) AEN: oic..\nya i tink longchen realised no doer first rite b4 seeing non dual the no agent is the non dual?\n(1:58 AM) Thusness: no agent as no doership...means in terms of controlling, coordinating\n(1:59 AM) Thusness: means there can be an agent, but that agent has no control\nthis means no doership. the other is the absence of an agent in phenomena. usually there are 2, the\nsubject and the object\n(1:59 AM) Thusness: get it?\n(2:00 AM) AEN: oic..\nyea i remember\ngalen sharp talked about\nu are the watcher, but there is no doer\nso thats only seeing the no doer aspect rite\n(2:00 AM) Thusness: not no doer. no doership\n(2:01 AM) AEN: ya\n516\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(2:01 AM) Thusness: one is referring to the phenomena as an entity. one is referring to whether we have\ncontrol over anything that is different\n(2:01 AM) AEN: oic..\n(2:02 AM) Thusness: means i do not see 2, i only see 1, in no doer\n(2:02 AM) Thusness: while no doership is seeing spontaneity without control. get it?\n(2:03 AM) AEN: yeah\nso no doer = no agent + no doership\n(2:03 AM) AEN: ?\n(2:03 AM) Thusness: yeah\n(2:03 AM) AEN: icic\n(2:03 AM) AEN: kiloby talks about an agent?\n(2:04 AM) Thusness: actually both but not clear.\nIn Soh’s I AM phase, John Tan told him not to mistaken anatta with [mere] non-doership:\n“Not to talk too much about me, just focus on your experience. Also what you said about the no observer\ncan be quite misleading. It does not mean there is 'no one doing anything' and 'everything is arising\nspontaneously'. You should understand anatta from below quotations taken from 'The Sun My Heart' by\nZen Master Thich Nhat Hanh:\n\"When we say I know the wind is blowing, we don't think that there is something blowing something else.\n\"Wind' goes with 'blowing'. If there is no blowing, there is no wind. It is the same with knowing. Mind is the\nknower; the knower is mind. We are talking about knowing in relation to the wind. 'To know' is to know\nsomething. Knowing is inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing are one. We can say, 'Wind,' and\nthat is enough. The presence of wind indicates the presence of knowing, and the presence of the action of\nblowing'.\" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh, The Sun My Heart\n\"..The most universal verb is the verb 'to be'': I am, you are, the mountain is, a river is. The verb 'to be'\ndoes not express the dynamic living state of the universe. To express that we must say 'become.' These\ntwo verbs can also be used as nouns: 'being\", \"becoming\". But being what? Becoming what? 'Becoming'\nmeans 'evolving ceaselessly', and is as universal as the verb \"to be.\" It is not possible to express the\n\"being\" of a phenomenon and its \"becoming\" as if the two were independent. In the case of wind, blowing\nis the being and the becoming....\" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh, The Sun My Heart\n\"In any phenomena, whether psychological, physiological, or physical, there is dynamic movement, life.\nWe can say that this movement, this life, is the universal manifestation, the most commonly recognized\naction of knowing. We must not regard 'knowing' as something from the outside which comes to breathe\nlife into the universe. It is the life of the universe itself. The dance and the dancer are one.\" ~ Thich Nhat\nHanh, The Sun My Heart\nComments by John Tan in 2009 on these paragraphs from “The Sun My Heart” (see excerpts in Sun of\nAwareness and River of Perceptions),\n517\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"...as a verb, as action, there can be no concept, only experience. Non-dual anatta (no-self) is the experience of\nsubject/Object as verb, as action. There is no mind, only mental activities... ...Source as the passing\nphenomena... and how non-dual appearance is understood from Dependent Origination perspective.\"\nZen Master Thich Nhat Hanh:\n\"When we say it's raining, we mean that raining is taking place. You don't need someone up above to\nperform the raining. It's not that there is the rain, and there is the one who causes the rain to fall. In fact,\nwhen you say the rain is falling, it's very funny, because if it weren't falling, it wouldn't be rain. In our way\nof speaking, we're used to having a subject and a verb. That's why we need the word \"it\" when we say, \"it\nrains.\" \"It\" is the subject, the one who makes the rain possible. But, looking deeply, we don't need a\n\"rainer,\" we just need the rain. Raining and the rain are the same. The formations of birds and the birds\nare the same -- there's no \"self,\" no boss involved.\nThere's a mental formation called vitarka, \"initial thought.\" When we use the verb \"to think\" in English, we\nneed a subject of the verb: I think, you think, he thinks. But, really, you don't need a subject for a thought\nto be produced. Thinking without a thinker -- it's absolutely possible. To think is to think about something.\nTo perceive is to perceive something. The perceiver and the perceived object that is perceived are one.\nWhen Descartes said, \"I think, therefore I am,\" his point was that if I think, there must be an \"I\" for\nthinking to be possible. When he made the declaration \"I think,\" he believed that he could demonstrate\nthat the \"I\" exists. We have the strong habit or believing in a self. But, observing very deeply, we can see\nthat a thought does not need a thinker to be possible. There is no thinker behind the thinking -- there is\njust the thinking; that's enough.\nNow, if Mr. Descartes were here, we might ask him, \"Monsieur Descartes, you say, 'You think, therefore\nyou are.' But what are you? You are your thinking. Thinking -- that's enough. Thinking manifests without\nthe need of a self behind it.\"\nThinking without a thinker. Feeling without a feeler. What is our anger without our 'self'? This is the object\nof our meditation. All the fifty-one mental formations take place and manifest without a self behind them\narranging for this to appear, and then for that to appear. Our mind consciousness is in the habit of basing\nitself on the idea of self, on manas. But we can meditate to be more aware of our store consciousness,\nwhere we keep the seeds of all those mental formations that are not currently manifesting in our mind.\nWhen we meditate, we practice looking deeply in order to bring light and clarity into our way of seeing\nthings. When the vision of no-self is obtained, our delusion is removed. This is what we call\ntransformation. In the Buddhist tradition, transformation is possible with deep understanding. The\nmoment the vision of no-self is there, manas, the elusive notion of 'I am,' disintegrates, and we find\nourselves enjoying, in this very moment, freedom and happiness.\"\n- Choosing\n518\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nEven when non-dual is realized in the case of Stage 4, Awareness can still be misunderstood in terms of the\nsecond type of non-dual, rather than the third (which is anatta and empty-clarity):\nThe Three Levels of \"Understanding\" of Non-dual Awareness\n“Originally posted by An Eternal Now:\nWhat I said here, is not really correct. Thought is, but no thinker. Sound is, but no hearer. Awareness cannot\nbe separated from thoughts and manifestation.\nJohn Tan replied:\nYes but what said can still have the following scenario:\n1. There is an Awareness reflecting thoughts and manifestation. (\"I AM\").\nMirror bright is experienced but distorted. Dualistic and Inherent seeing.\n2. Thoughts and manifestation are required for the mirror to see itself.\nNon-Dualistic but Inherent seeing. Beginning of non-dual insight.\n3. Thoughts and manifestation have always been the mirror (The mirror here is seen as a whole).\nNon-Dualistic and non-inherent insight.\nIn 3 not even a quantum line can be drawn from whatever arises; whatever that appears to come and goes\nis the Awareness itself. There is no Awareness other than that. We should use the teachings of Anatta (no-\nself), DO (dependent origination) and Emptiness to see the 'forms' of awareness.” - John Tan, 2009\nThe second case is similar to the cyber sangha 17 year old kid quoted in Phase 4, that said “They [the\nreflections] are the mirror, yet the mirror isn't the reflections.” In Phase 5, the reflections are the mirror and\nthere is no mirror besides the reflections/on-going manifesting/reflecting (whatever arises is Presencing\nwith no Presence besides those colors, sounds, sensations, scents, tastes, thoughts), nothing unchanging\nor independent and self-standing, no need for a metaphysical essence at all. The sense of being an ultimate\nand changeless metaphysical essence, source and substratum is replaced by pure manifestation and one\nthen begins to penetrate into Dependent Origination as the mechanism of pure manifestation (see Stage\n6).\nThanissaro Bhikkhu said in a commentary on this sutta Mulapariyaya Sutta: The Root Sequence -\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN1.html:\nAlthough at present we rarely think in the same terms as the Samkhya philosophers, there has long been — and\nstill is — a common tendency to create a \"Buddhist\" metaphysics in which the experience of emptiness, the\nUnconditioned, the Dharma-body, Buddha-nature, rigpa, etc., is said to function as the ground of being from\n519\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nwhich the \"All\" — the entirety of our sensory & mental experience — is said to spring and to which we return when\nwe meditate. Some people think that these theories are the inventions of scholars without any direct meditative\nexperience, but actually they have most often originated among meditators, who label (or in the words of the\ndiscourse, \"perceive\") a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal, identify with it in a subtle way (as\nwhen we are told that \"we are the knowing\"), and then view that level of experience as the ground of being out of\nwhich all other experience comes.\nAny teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same criticism that the Buddha directed against the\nmonks who first heard this discourse.\nRob Burbea said regarding that sutta in Realizing the Nature of Mind:\nOne time the Buddha to a group of monks and he basically told them not to see Awareness as The Source of all\nthings. So this sense of there being a vast awareness and everything just appears out of that and disappears back\ninto it, beautiful as that is, he told them that’s actually not a skillful way of viewing reality. And that is a very\ninteresting sutta, because it’s one of the only suttas where at the end it doesn’t say the monks rejoiced in his words.\nThis group of monks didn’t want to hear that. They were quite happy with that level of insight, lovely as it was,\nand it said the monks did not rejoice in the Buddha’s words. (laughter) And similarly, one runs into this as a\nteacher, I have to say. This level is so attractive, it has so much of the flavor of something ultimate, that often\ntimes people are unbudgeable there.\n2009:\n“(11:48 AM) Thusness: the advaita experience will sort of see awareness as permeating and transcending\nthat is because the view is rest upon subject-object dualism. if it is resting upon DO (dependent origination),\nthere is no such problem. How important is the 'Source' if it is resting on a view that has no source, center,\nsubstantiality and inherent essence? it becomes irrelevant and erroneous and nothing to boast about. Only\nwhen we rest our view on a 'Source', Ultimate reality seems very special.”\nThe realization of the self-luminosity of manifestation - an important criteria for Stage 5 - hasn’t arisen in\nall of these earlier phases of mere non-doership, impersonality and non-dual (non-dual luminosity is also\nexperienced in Stage 4 but reified into an unchanging awareness inseparable from manifestation, but in\nStage 5 even that something unchanging is seen through and dissolved). Daniel Ingram explains well the\nself-luminosity of manifestation below:\nhttps://www.dharmaoverground.org/.../mess.../message/9383580\nDhO questioner: What is Luminosity?\n520\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nDaniel M. Ingram:\nLuminosity is both a useful and possibly very misleading term.\nHere's what it is doesn't mean: that a person will suddenly see things more brightly, that there will be more light\nin things than the standard amount, or anything like that.\nHere's what it points to, said a number of equivalent ways:\n1) In the seeing, just the seen. In the hearing, just the heard. In cognition, just the cognized. In feeling, just the felt...\nThis standard line from the Bahiya of the Bark Cloth Sutta in the Udana is one of the most profound there is in\nthe whole of the Pali Canon. It means that sensations are just sensations, simply that, with no knower, doer, be-\ner (not beer, as that is a beverage), or self in them to be found at all.\n2) Point one, taken in its logical inverse, means that the \"light\" of awareness is in things where they are, including\nall of the space between/around/through them equally.\n3) Said another way, things just are aware/manifest/occurring where they are just as they are, extremely\nstraightforwardly.\nHelpful?\nDaniel\nLuminous Presence may come at a later phase for a practitioner depending on conditions, Pellucid\nNo-Self vs Non-Doership\nFor John Tan, Soh and many others, the aspect of luminous Presence-Awareness is realized even at their\nearliest phases of development.\nHowever, some people may have certain understanding (perhaps not direct realization) into emptiness,\nand certain insights into non-dual anatta, without the direct realization of luminous Presence. Without\nthis aspect, one’s experiential insights are still incomplete.\n“Pellucid No-Self, Non-Doership\nOf late I had a few conversations with a number of people whose experience of no-self is skewed towards\nnon-doership rather than pellucid no-self, the pellucidity of luminosity in nondual and no-self.

Hee-Jin Kim further explains\nthe meaning of genjokoan:\n'It does not suggest an evolutionary ascent from hidden-ness to manifestation, or from imperfection to\nperfection, or conversely, an emanational descent from one to many, or from reality to appearance.\nRather, things, events, beings are already unmistakably what they truly are; what is more, they are\nvibrant, transparent, and bright in their as-they-are-ness.'” - Zen teacher Shinshu Roberts”\n“At this time, everything in the Universe in the ten directions - soil, earth, grass, and trees; fences, walls,\ntiles and pebbles - perform the Buddha’s work...

That is\nEncountering Presence in its first impression, unadulterated and full blown in stillness.\nSo after reading it, just feel it with your entire body-mind and forgot about it. Don't let it corrupt your\nmind.\nPresence, Awareness, Beingness, Isness are all synonyms. There can be all sorts of definitions but all these\nare not the path to it. The path to it must be non-conceptual and direct. This is the only way.\nWhen contemplating the koan \"before birth who am I\", the thinking mind attempts to seek into it's memory\nbank for similar experiences to get an answer. This is how the thinking mind works - compare, categorize\nand measure in order to understand.\nHowever when we encounter such a koan, the mind reaches its limit when it tries to penetrate its own\ndepth with no answer. It will come a time the mind exhausts itself and come to a complete standstill and\nfrom that stillness comes an earthshaking BAM!\nI. Just I.\nBefore birth this I, a thousand years ago this I, a thousand later this I. I AM I.\nIt is without any arbitrary thoughts, any comparisons. It fully authenticates it's own clarity, it's own\nexistence, ITSELF in clean, pure, direct non-conceptuality. No why, no because.\nJust ITSELF in stillness nothing else.\nIntuit the vipassana and the samatha. Intuit the total exertion and realization. The essence of message\nmust be raw and uncontaminated by words. It cannot be secondhand.\nHope that helps!\n…\n...There is nothing underneath everything, in the state of I AM, it is just I AM. The rest of the 5 sense doors\nare shut. Everything else is excluded. It is called I simply because of the koan, nothing else.\n525\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nWhat’s experienced is similar to hearing sound without the sense of hearer. So keep the experience but\nrefine the view.” - John Tan to someone in Awakening to Reality Discussion Group, 2019\n“Thanks for the sharing.\nThis is the I AM realization.

I told him what I call anatta is not just being centerless, it is the effulgence\nand radiance of the transience. That is, regardless of any realization of no-self, and no matter how\ncenterless one feels or how centerless is one's experience of awareness and so forth... still, anything short\nof direct realization of the radiance or luminosity as the very stuff of transiency is still not what I call the\nrealization of anatta. (And that too is also just an aspect of anatta, and furthermore not yet into the twofold\nemptying)”\n~ Soh, 2018\nEven after anatta, John Tan has at times told me to revisit the aspect of I AM. It is possible, even important,\nto integrate that quality and taste. He also calls it ‘reversing the cycle of insight’. One may need to cycle\nthrough the phases of insights, sort of to refresh one’s practice and deepen it, for a few rounds.\n“After the maturity of anatta insight and twofold emptiness, eventually there is effortless, ongoing and\nintense experience of \"everything as Self\", \"As in that experience of I AM powerfully present at this moment\",\n526\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"As if like Awareness clear and open like space, without meditation yet powerfully present and non-dual.\nWhere the 4 Aspects of I AM are fully experienced in this moment. This experience will become more and\nmore powerful later yet effortless and uncontrived. How so? If it is not correct insights and practice, how is\nit possible for such complete and total experience of effortless and uncontrived Presence be possible?\".\n\"Indeed and this is being authenticated by the immediate moment of experience. How could there be\ndoubt about it. The last trace of Presence must be released with seeing through the emptiness nature of\nwhatever arises. After maturing and integrating your insights into practice, there must be no effort and\naction.... The entire whole is doing the work and arises as this vivid moment of shimmering appearance,\nthis has always been what we always called Presence.\" \"Yes and you should in all moment of 6 entries and\nexits experience all coming together for this moment to arise....this will dissolve all senses of holdings and\nwill lead you effortless and maha experience of suchness effortlessly\", \"interpenetration, open, boundless,\neffortless and uncontrived.\"” - John Tan, 2012\n“There is a very intense and much deeper state I assure you...but there is clear understanding that the\nmanifestation is it....however awareness is like an unbounded and limitless expanse field. The luminosity is\nintensely clear, the experience is like Non-Dual Awareness broke loose and exist as an unbounded FIELD.\nThere is a difference in seeing sound and a hearer and realizing sound as awareness itself. You cannot\nfocus and there cannot be any sense of effort, there cannot be any sense of boundaries, just itself. You\nmust be very very stable and mature in the anatta state, and you cannot be in an enclosed room... it is the\neffortlessness and crystal clear transparency and intensity of luminosity... but duality must no more trouble\nthe practitioner, phenomena is clearly understood as the radiance... so nothing is obscuring then in total\neffortless and emanation arises and the expanse just continues\", \"one mind is subsuming, therefore there\nis a sense of dual. In this case there isn't. It is like a drop of water landed on the surface of a clear ocean.\nThe nature of water and ocean are one and the same...nothing containing anything, when sounds and\nmusic arise... they are like water and waves in ocean... everything is it\" - John Tan, 2013\nThusness said to Soh in 2013:\n\"As I suspected (thumbs up) I mean the rainbow body. That can only be done after realization of twofold\nemptiness and intensity of luminosity into the three states (waking, dreaming, deep sleep)... you are\ndoing pretty well. The integration has been progressing well of the non-dual bliss into your deep sleep\nstate, in view of the short period after your realization of anatta. The inner core must completely\ndisappear and the intensity of luminosity must heighten... Sensations will become transparent and crystal\nsharp clear.\nAt present the core center is gone... You write too much and have too little rest. Your mind must have\nenough time to rest in non-conceptuality of the 6 entries and exits. Otherwise it will not be easy for you to\npenetrate further. After realizing the twofold emptying there is no more boundaries between mind,\nappearances and apparent objects and experience becomes seamless... All is mind or this integrated\nactivity. Then we should actualize and integrate this realization.\nIn touching, both subject and object are both emptied and deconstructed into a single activity of touch\n527\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nand the intensity of luminous clarity must be strong... is it strong now? Or just like passing thoughts with\nno intensity.\nNow penetration of the 3 states is only supported by the strength of your view and realization, not by the\nintensity of your non-conceptual experience.\n\"In essence rainbow body is a realization...\" Maybe actualization of realization (would be better), in\nessence it is an actualized state.\"\nmy comment: Dzogchen practitioners use the term 'Realization' differently than I and Thusness,\n'Realization' could mean something like full actualization or Buddhahood for them and not just an initial\ninsight/recognition/experience.\nAlso what Thusness said here may be unrelated to Dzogchen rainbow body and is just a personal advise.”\n- https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2013/03/rainbow-body-and-thusness-advice-to-me.html\nAlan Watts: The Silent Mind\nJohn Tan\nAll the 4 parts of his talks [The Silent Mind] are good.\nSoh Wei Yu\nhttps://youtu.be/eIh6VRoTDY8\nJohn Tan: What do you find lacking in Alan Watt's \"The silent mind\" talk?\nHe spoke of anatta, seeing DO, emptiness of mental constructs, effortlessness and spontaneity, in the\nflow but what is missing? Or do you see anything missing?\n[12:35 PM, 9/1/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Didnt describe intensity of luminosity?\n[12:37 PM, 9/1/2020] John Tan: Yes.

Rather it is the insight that sees through mental constructs (reifications) and\nconventionalities. It is an unbinding process of freeing the mind from being blinded by the semantics of\nconventions (existence, physicality, cause and effect, production) that is more crucial.”\nEven if luminosity and anatta is realised, there are differing depths. In the first few months after anatta\nrealization (2010) for Soh, the luminosity was very strong and samadhi (absorption) state in daily life is\nstrong. Afterwards, it sort of diminished slightly. However it became much stronger at a later phase,\nespecially 2018~2019 onwards:\n“It's not often that I get to walk in dark places in Singapore, there's street lights everywhere. Yesterday I was\nwalking somewhere that was dark and yet the light of boundless presence was so dazzling. Truly, there can\nbe no darkness when your whole body-mind-universe is light, the light that 'outshines' all lights and\ndarknesses, and yet is also none other than the lights and darknesses, the sounds and the silence.\nWas reminded of a verse in the Upanishads, \"Verily, for him who thus knows this Brahma—Upanishad, the\nsun does not rise or set. For him it is day for ever.\"” - Soh, 2018\n“Lately the intensity here seems to be intensifying even further and whole body-mind-universe is/are\nspheres of boundless light as manifestation, the textures and details of the moment.\nWas jogging just now and this boundless light (empty-clarity as the whole infinite field of manifestation) just\nkeeps intensifying and intensifying into complete stunning brilliance, and had this out of body feel -- which\nis not a dissociated state (I can no longer experience subject/object dualistic state nor dissociation, nondual\nis always experienced here) but like a dispersing into the infinite field, and yet this is not mere mind-body\ndrop as mind-body drop is already my ever-present state for many years.” - Soh, 2018\n“Like pure open awareness. Lol. Without center without boundaries. However it is often misinterpreted as\nalways...something behind. Don't hold on to any experience, not the radiance. Allow the knowledge of\nemptiness to seamlessly integrate into radiance clarity. Let the radiance be as light as feather but immense\nlike universe. Don't be intense.\n529\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n[24/3/19, 6:19:06 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Today the sense of tightness seems loosening and yet the radiance is still\nas clear.. I had headache two days ago dunno why. Maybe some tenseness\n[24/3/19, 6:19:18 PM] John Tan: Yes. Because you don't know how to relax. You have wrong understanding\nattempting to focus on intensity unknowingly, wanted to feel more. Therefore I kept telling you relax, don't\nhold, be as light as feather and as immense as universe. With practice Awareness will stand out, more\nbraman than braman… lol. However that is an emergence effect due to evenness of pristine empty clarity.”\n- John Tan, 2019\n“Presence is experienced as very fine energetic vibrations even in daily life these days.. in the five senses,\ndon’t know how to describe it well.” - Soh\n“The Absolute as separated from the transience is what I have indicated as the 'Background' in my 2 posts\nto theprisonergreco.\n84. RE: Is there an absolute reality? [Skarda 4 of 4]\nMar 27 2009, 9:15 AM EDT | Post edited: Mar 27 2009, 9:15 AM EDT\nHi theprisonergreco,\nFirst is what exactly is the ‘background’? Actually it doesn’t exist. It is only an image of a ‘non-dual’ experience\nthat is already gone. The dualistic mind fabricates a ‘background’ due to the poverty of its dualistic and\ninherent thinking mechanism. It ‘cannot’ understand or function without something to hold on to. That\nexperience of the ‘I’ is a complete, non-dual foreground experience.\nWhen the background subject is understood as an illusion, all transience phenomena reveal themselves as\nPresence. It is like naturally 'vipassanic' throughout. From the hissing sound of PC, to the vibration of the\nmoving MRT train, to the sensation when the feet touches the ground, all these experiences are crystal\nclear, no less “I AM” than “I AM”. The Presence is still fully present, nothing is denied. -:) So the “I AM” is just\nlike any other experiences when the subject-object split is gone. No different from an arising sound. It only\nbecomes a static background as an afterthought when our dualistic and inherent tendencies are in action.\nThe first 'I-ness' stage of experiencing awareness face to face is like a point on a sphere which you called it\nthe center. You marked it.\nThen later you realized that when you marked other points on the surface of a sphere, they have the same\ncharacteristics. This is the initial experience of non-dual. Once the insight of No-Self is stabilized, you just\nfreely point to any point on the surface of the sphere -- all points are a center, hence there is no 'the' center.\n'The' center does not exist: all points are a center.\nAfter then practice move from 'concentrative' to 'effortlessness'. That said, after this initial non-dual insight,\n'background' will still surface occasionally for another few years due to latent tendencies...\n530\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n86. RE: Is there an absolute reality? [Skarda 4 of 4]\nTo be more exact, the so called 'background' consciousness is that pristine happening. There is no a\n'background' and a 'pristine happening'. During the initial phase of non-dual, there is still habitual attempt\nto 'fix' this imaginary split that does not exist. It matures when we realized that anatta is a seal, not a stage;\nin hearing, always only sounds; in seeing always only colors, shapes and forms; in thinking, always only\nthoughts. Always and already so. -:)\nMany non-dualists after the intuitive insight of the Absolute hold tightly to the Absolute. This is like attaching\nto a point on the surface of a sphere and calling it 'the one and only center'. Even for those Advaitins that\nhave clear experiential insight of no-self (no object-subject split), an experience similar to that of anatta\n(First emptying of subject) are not spared from these tendencies. They continue to sink back to a Source.\nIt is natural to reference back to the Source when we have not sufficiently dissolved the latent disposition\nbut it must be correctly understood for what it is. Is this necessary and how could we rest in the Source\nwhen we cannot even locate its whereabout? Where is that resting place? Why sink back? Isn't that another\nillusion of the mind? The 'Background' is just a thought moment to recall or an attempt to reconfirm the\nSource. How is this necessary? Can we even be a thought moment apart? The tendency to grasp, to solidify\nexperience into a 'center' is a habitual tendency of the mind at work. It is just a karmic tendency. Realize It!\nThis is what I meant to Adam the difference between One-Mind and No-Mind.” - John Tan, 2009, excerpt\nfrom Emptiness as Viewless View and Embracing the Transience\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/04/emptiness-as-viewless-view.html\nThere are those that have very clear understanding of sunyata, and yet lack direct taste of PCE (Pure\nConsciousness Experience) and luminosity and clear realization of anatta (direct realization of\nradiance/effulgence in/as transience), and in that case the luminosity must come up in later phases. But for\nthose who went through I AM phase first, there is not much danger of missing out the luminosity aspect of\ndirect realization, and it is just a path of letting that luminosity's taste and nature unfold into complete\nfreedom from fabrication and effortless, spontaneous perfection.\nAs John Tan also wrote in 2011:\nJohn: now what pegembara said is more like sunyata and emptiness. but that is understanding. it is like\ndharma dan. the intensity of luminosity is not fully appreciated\nSoh: I see, but dharma dan does have realization right. You mean like the insight is there but not the depth\nof experience\nJohn: no. I mean luminosity. you are too worried about who is realized and who is not\n531\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nand completely missing the essence of what that is being conveyed. if no one is there to point out to you,\nthen you can get stuck for a very long period. so you must be pay more attention to this\nSoh: Stuck in what\nJohn: pegembara lacks the luminosity. get stuck in 'not seeing'. means no penetration in insight. pegembara\nis like having phase 6 understanding but lack the intensity of luminosity\nand phase 6 direct insight. yet you are talking about dharma dan. are you going to help dharma dan now?\nis he writing the blog? you are not attending because you are so caught up on who has realized what even\nit is not here. so if there is no one to point out to you, how are you to progress with this sort of mindset\nwhat must be your advice to pegembara?\nSoh: To look into the intensity of luminosity?\nJohn: in this case, he must have direct PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience)\nbecause he lacks this. for the pces, you must point out what pegembara said but in a skillful way. for tarin’s\ncase, you must penetrate the difference between the agent and the sense of self\nSoh: What you mean by point out what pegembara said\nJohn: then there is depth of insight of the immediate moment. otherwise you are always just pouring out\nfrom memory. means you are not practicing in daily activity, you are staying at the conceptual level. this is\nthe actual situation and conditions and you apply skillful means accordingly. also from what pegembara\nsaid, you must also realized that from what he said, he has great potential for he brought out several\nimportant points\nSoh Wei Yu In 2008, Tsultrim Tserri wrote:\n“Mind has often been likened to a mirror, but the analogy goes only so far, because mirrors exist and mind\ndoesn't, well let's say that one can touch mirrors. What existence means, particularly at these levels, would\nbe a fruitful topic, but one that I will not cover. Also , mind doesn't really reflect phenomena, it is the\nphenomena themselves. This is covered further down in these 4 prajnas, but for clarity I thought I should\nmention that.\n\"John' or \"suchness\" is what one feels with the experience of emptiness. It is a solid sense of being (yes, emptiness\nhas a solid or one could say rich feeling). The luminescence of mind can be compared the the surface of a mirror.\nIf the mirror is dirty it doesn't have a bright surface, and if mind is filled with obscuration its awareness is dimmed.\nWith the experience of emptiness, phenomena become more vivid. It is said in the post that this confirms one's\nentrance into Zen. In the vajrayana, this vividness of mind is called \"osel\" in Tibetan, and it is a sign that one has\n532\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nentered the vajrayana. In my experience, this is quite far along the path. To get to this point, one would have to\nexperience egolessness of self, egolessness of other, nondualty, emptiness, and only then luminosity.\nFrom another thread: \"Exist is a tricky word in Buddhism. Mind does not exist in the sense of being a thing, but\nit does exist as well, otherwise how would we be able to see, hear etc.\nHaving said that, for an individual, there is nothing \"outside of awareness.\" Everything that happens to us happens\nin our awareness(it's not ours, but so what). Furthermore, we are literally everything that happens in our\nawareness. There is no self; we are simply the world. if we see a chair in our kitchen, that is what we are at that\nmoment since there is no separation between phenomena and mind. Phenomena are mind and mind is\nphenomena.\nTsultrim\"\nJohn: this tsultrim's insight is stage 6. truly good. not many can truly feel the differences. it is only until a\ncertain phase of experience then that clarity comes. and often in tremendous in the stability of\nthoughtlessness... thought almost seldom arise and one becomes the full vividness of arising phenomena.\nis he a dzogchen practitioner?\nSoh: I think mahamudra. he talks about the four yoga. \"(Yes, this agrees, in my opinion, with\n\"nonmeditation\" in the 4 yogas of mahamudra, the last and most fruitional yoga of mahamudra.\" and he\nlinked the 4 jnanas to the 4 yogas\nJohn: actually what he said about prajna and jhana is quite good. But you have to know that it is not the\nsort of jhana as in concentration. it is the experience of effortlessness in non-dual luminosity. There will\ncome a time every day mundane activities, practice and enlightenment is just one substance.\nSoh: no he said jnana. jnana is more like knowledge. not jhana absorption\nJohn: I see. There will come a time when emptiness becomes so clear and the separation is no more then\nwithout the need to recall or remind. The last veil that separates is like permanently gone. Then there is no\npractice because all moments of arising phenomena is just one practice.\nSoh: I see.. That’s what he means by observing emptiness and 'being' emptiness right. I mean the difference\nbetween it\nIn a post above, I distinguished between the two. I know you asked Matylda, but until she replies, if she does,\npossibly I could be of help.\nPrajna is the tool that sees emptiness. It is actually an expansion of awareness, using awareness in the context of\nmindfulness/awareness. Awareness gets to a point where it discovers the nature of mind which includes emptiness.\nAt that point, awareness transforms into prajna. There are lesser stages of prajna as well, but I would have to\nreview them.\n533\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nPrajna has been likened to the mother of all the Buddhas, because through its activity the mind that becomes the\nBuddha mind is born. Actually, it has always been there, and is unborn, but let's not quibble.\nSo, prajna sees emptiness. When first seen, however, one feels emptiness as separate from what has discovered\nit. There is still a slight trace of dualism. We experience this dualism as a seeking for emptiness ie there is a seeker\nand something sought. At the realization of jnana, this duality melts, so to speak, and emptiness exists or doesn't\nexist without a sense of something observing it. Also, one attains wisdom when emptiness arises, not wisdom\nabout anything, simply being in the state of wisdom. With prajna, one observes that wisdom; with jnana, one\nbecomes it.\nTsultrim\nJohn: jnana here does not refer to the type of concentration like it said. It is an effortless non-dual luminous\nexperience due to the maturing of prajna.\nI have often said clear until absorbed. Vividness of forms.\nIt is the outcome of the clarity of insight due to the dissolving of that tendency to divide. It is natural, not a\nform of attention or concentration. This should not be misunderstood.\nHe mentioned about luminosity is the last fruition stage and one must go through emptiness to realise this\nstage.\nThis is not exactly right. :) Advaita Vedanta practitioner will experience the opposite. :)\nSoh: but for mahamudra it is like that right, theravada also? like dharma dan\nJohn: yes. it is because of right view. without the right view, you will experience luminosity aspect of\nawareness without knowing its empty nature. that is more dangerous. therefore establishment of right\nview is most important. Seeds are planted. It is better not to experience then to experience the wrong stuff\nand makes it more difficult to get out of the dualistic experience of Eternal Witness.\n(Comments by Soh: Regarding whether it is important to go through I AM realization or can we skip to\nanatta -- John Tan and I and Sim Pern Chong have had differing and evolving opinions about this over the\nyears (I remember Sim Pern Chong saying he thinks people can skip it altogether, John also wondered if it\nis possible or advisable as certain AF people seem to have skipped it but experience luminosity), however\nafter witnessing the progress of people it seems to us that those who went into anatta without the I AM\nrealization tend to miss out the luminosity and intensity of luminosity. And then they will have to go through\nanother phase. For those with I AM realization, the second stanza of anatta comes very easily, in fact the\nfirst aspect to become more apparent. Nowadays John and my opinion is that it is best to go through the I\nAM phase, then nondual and anatta..\nThere was also the worry that by leading people into the I AM, they can get stuck there. (As John Tan and\nSim Pern Chong was stuck there for decades)\n534\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nBut I have shown that it is possible to progress rather quickly (in eight months) from I AM to anatta. So the\nbeing stuck is due to lack of right pointers and directions, not inherently an issue with I AM.\nAnd the way to progress quickly is to be aware of the pitfalls of the I AM as I wrote in the AtR guide, and\ngoing along the four aspects of I AM and then nondual contemplations or two stanzas of anatta. If I kept\nreinforcing the pitfalls of I AM with wrong view, maybe I can get stuck there. Likewise for other phases,\nthere are other pitfalls as well. Even after anatta, John Tan has at times told me to revisit the aspect of I AM.\nIt is possible, even important, to integrate that quality and taste.)\n------\np.s. John also wrote in 2007,\n\"The understanding 'of arising as yuan (conditions)' must be factored to all aspects of our lives. Applying\nthis insight to the six stages of my experiences, you must see them not as indications of stages at all. There\nare no higher or lower stages, all merely serves as conditions for ‘new insight’ to arise. A practitioner may\nstart from training himself to ‘witness’ the empty nature of phenomena (stage 6) yet still having a clear\ndistinction of observer and observed being dual; but the gradual loosening of ‘solidity’ of all internal or\nexternal phenomena having no inherent existence will slowly leads to the non-dual experience.\"\n\"Here the highlight must not only be the empty nature of ‘sound’ alone, that luminosity as ‘sound’ must\nsimilarly be emphasized. When we stripped-off the symbolic representation of ‘bird’, ‘chirping’, ‘outside’,\n‘eyes-organ’, ‘ears-organs’, ‘senate reality’ and merely experience in bare, this is the meditative state of\nintuitively knowing that quality of being luminous in oneness. Oneness as there is nothing to divide when\ndevoid of these symbolic layering. The depth of the crystal clarity of that pure experience – ‘chirping’ is not\nwhat language can convey. The point here is not to bring about a scientific study on the topic of qualia but\nto have a direct feel of the full absorption in the delight of that clear-luminosity of ‘sound’. It is the ‘depth\nand degree’ of absorptive-clarity yet non-staying that is most important; not the symbolic understanding of\nmeanings.\nIt may be a good prompt at this juncture to ask \"Is remaining ‘in the mode that is free of symbols’ the only\nway to experience non-duality?\"\"\n..............\nSoh Wei Yu\nSoh Wei Yu MS: good descriptions :)\n535\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAs you are already having nondual taste of all phenomena as one's radiance, just let it unfold naturally, and\nintensity becomes clear when the center is completely severed in 'no cold and heat'*, and its intensity can\nfurther expand many-fold into an oceanic state ( https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-\nunbound-field-of-awareness.html ).\nJohn wrote to Pegembara in 2011:\n\"Not so much of becoming disillusioned; rather with the maturing of this view, the mind releases itself from\nany forms of 'holding'.\nThere are 2 additional points that I think are important:\n1. Anatta is not Sunyata\n2. Although whatever arises is empty of inherent essence, it must also be understood that it is vividly clear,\npresent and luminous. The passing scent, the taste, the scenery, the arising sound, the arising\nthought...these magical appearances are themselves primordially pure, they are the Dharmakaya.\"\n*No Cold or Heat:\nWhere There Is No Cold or Heat\nA monk asked Tozan, “When cold and heat come, how can we avoid them?”\nTozan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nThe monk said, “What is the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nTozan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you; when it’s hot, the heat kills you.”\nThis is not advice to “accept” your situation, as some commentators have suggested, but a direct expression\nof authentic practice and enlightenment. Master Tozan is not saying, “When cold, shiver; when hot, sweat,”\nnor is he saying, “When cold, put on a sweater; when hot, use a fan.” In the state of authentic practice and\nenlightenment, the cold kills you, and there is only cold in the whole universe. The heat kills you, and there\nis only heat in the whole universe. The fragrance of incense kills you, and there is only the fragrance of\nincense in the whole universe. The sound of the bell kills you, and there is only “boooong” in the whole\nuniverse…\n~The Flatbed Sutra of Louie Wing, Ted Biringer\nJohn Tan: The place where there is no earth, fire, wind, space, water…\nis the place where the earth, fire, wind, space and water kills “You” and fully shines as its own radiance, a\ncomplete taste of itself and fully itself.\n536\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nI seem to be having some breakthroughs and insights into anatta but it is not so stable yet.\nContinue contemplating until the insight of “always already so” arises and sinks in deeply into your\nmindstream.\nSee the comments and advices by John in the comment section of The Buddha on Non-Duality, focus on\ncontemplating the first point below.\n“At first 'effort' to focus on experiencing on the vividness of 'sensation' in the most immediate and direct\nway will remain. It will be 'concentrative' for some time before it turns effortless.\nThere are a few points I would like to share:\n1. Insight that 'anatta' is a seal and not a stage must arise to further progress into the 'effortless' mode.\nThat is, anatta is the ground of all experiences and has always been so, no I. In seeing, always only seen, in\nhearing always only sound and in thinking, always only thoughts. No effort required and never was there\nan 'I'.\n2. It is better not to treat sensation as 'real' as the word 'real' in Buddhism carries a different meaning. It is\nrather a moment of vivid, luminous presence but nothing 'real'. It may be difficult to realise why is this\nimportant but it will become clearer in later phase of our progress.\n3. Do go further into the aspect of dependent origination and emptiness to further 'purify' the experience\nof anatta. Not only is there no who, there is no where and when in all manifestation.\nWhatever said are nothing authoritative. Just a sharing and happy Journey!”\n“You need to understand the difference between insight and experience. What you are describing so far is\nan experience.

Wrong\nunderstanding includes the notion that “suffering” is caused by a real “sufferer”, “action” is caused by a real\n“actor/doer”, and hence if the doer dissolves there is no more action, or if there is suffering/action that\nimplies there is a real sufferer/doer that is present and causing it (and when sufferer dissolves the suffering\ngoes with it), etc. Or that because there is no sufferer, there is also no suffering (a nihilistic interpretation\nof no-self and emptiness).\n\"There never was a self. One must re-orientate oneself that it is functionality and action that give rise to\n[the sense of a] self/entity rather than [a real] agent giving rise to action. Therefore from anatta, we see\nDependent Origination, cause and conditions, action, karma... unlike [the misunderstanding of] no-self\ntherefore no dependent origination and causality. The former is non-substantialist view, the later is using\nsubstantialist self view to understand anatta (no-self).\" - John Tan, 2015\n“Buddhist teachings refer to this idea that an ultimate absence of identity somehow renders conventional\nactivity and processes invalid as “nihilism” [uccedavāda].\nA “self” is ultimately a secondary imputation that is attributed to a complex nexus of causal activity. By\nnegating that imputation in a blanketed manner which calls into question and all processes that said “self”\nis attributed to, we only negate that surface level designation. However this does not resolve the causal\nnexus of afflictive activity that the designation is imputed onto.\nIn Buddhist teachings, the sense of selfhood is a byproduct of activity. Not the other way around.\nIn some “spiritual” approaches, such as neo-Advaita, they believe the imputation is primary and the\nactivity is secondary. And so they only negate the imputation and then ask “who is there to do X?” or “who\ncould have such and such realization?” or “there is no one who suffers because the self is a concept,” etc.,\nbut this only negates a surface level imputation and completely ignores the underlying factors that cause\nidentification as a whole.\nIn contrast, the buddhadharma says that identity and identification in general is a process that is caused\nby afflictive action. The “self” as an imputation ie merely the very tip of the iceberg in terms of the activity\nthat spawns identification and suffering. Therefore negating the self does not actually resolve the issue.\nWe agree that the self is a construct, and that selves are ultimately false, but we as practitioners of the\nbuddhadharma also understand that there is underlying activity that manifests the self. That affliction\nmust be resolved. Ignorance, grasping, etc., the afflictive chain of dependent origination that underlies\nselfhood.\n538\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThe self does not create action. Action creates the self.\nTherefore negating the self does not resolve affliction or the activity of dependent origination that creates\nthe driving force of identification which binds us as sentient beings.\nThe process of bondage and the process of liberation in Buddhism are agentless action. Agentless\nactivity. The agent is always secondary and is merely a useful designation that claims ownership.\nTherefore it is vital to understand there are causes and conditions that create samsara and the delusion\nof selfhood, and there is the undoing of those causes and conditions which leads to liberation.” – Kyle\nDixon, 2021\n\"No-self/Anatta is not about denying thinking, action, carrying water and chopping wood... and this is the\nkey difference between genuine anatta insight from dualistic conceptual understanding. The very notion\nthat \"action\" and \"intention\" implies, or necessitates, an \"actor\", and therefore for non-action the intentions\nand actions must also cease, is precisely using dualistic thinking to understanding anatta...\nAction never required a self (in fact there never was a self or a doer apart from action to begin with: only a\ndelusion of one), and action does not need to perpetuate the myth of a self. The myth of a self is not exactly\ndependent on action or lack thereof. Sure, action that arises out of the dualistic sense of actor/act where\nthere is an \"I\" trying to modify or achieve \"that\" is a form of action produced by ignorance. But not all\nactions necessarily arise out of an underlying sense of duality. If all actions arise out of a sense of duality,\nthen after awakening one will just die as he cannot even feed himself.\nWhen one is operating with a dualistic way of understanding, one thinks that action implies a self that is\ndoing an act, and one thinks that non-action implies that the self ends with the action. But genuine insight\ninto non-action is simply the realization that never was there a real actor behind action, so there is always\nin acting just that action - whole being is only the total exertion of action, and this is always already the case\nbut not realized. That is true non-action - there is no subject (actor) performing an act (object).\"\n- Soh, 2013, Non-Action\n\"Mere suffering is, not any sufferer is found\nThe deeds exist, but no performer of the deeds:\nNibbana is, but not the man that enters it,\nThe path is, but no wanderer is to be seen.\"\n“No doer of the deeds is found,\nNo one whoever reaps their fruits,\nEmpty phenomena roll on,\nThis view alone is right and true.\nNo god, no Brahma, may be called,\n539\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThe maker of this wheel of life,\nEmpty phenomena roll on,\nDependent on conditions all.\n…\nEverywhere, in all the realms of existence, the noble disciple sees only mental and corporeal phenomena\nkept going through the concatenation of causes and effects.

Action does not require an agent to initiate it. It is language that\ncreates the confusion that nouns are required to set verbs into motion.\nTherefore the action of choosing continues albeit no chooser.\n\"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;\nThe deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;\nNibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;\nThe path is, but no traveler on it is seen.\"\nRelated:\nAlan Watts: Agent and Action\nInvestigation into Movement\n540\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAlso, an enlightening conversation recently (thankfully with permission from Arcaya Malcolm to share\nthis) in Arcaya Malcolm's facebook group:\n\"[Participant 1]\nJune 14 at 2:40 PM\nI came across a passage in a book I'm reading which brings up how Nagarjuna often bases arguments on\nunstated and unproven premises and manipulates ambiguities in language to justify his arguments\nleading to criticisms of sophistry. How do later authors address this if they do at all?\nOne example from chap 3 of the MMK with the following 3 arguments:\n\"Vision cannot in anyway see itself. Now if it cannot see itself, how can it see other things?\n\"The example of fire is not adequate to establish vision. These have been refuted with the analysis of\nmovement, past, future, and present\" - refers to the refutation from chap 2\n\"When no vision occurs there is nothing to be called visions. How then can it be said: vision sees?\"\nThe book brings up the following critcism respectively:\nThis is based on the assumption for objects to have certain functions it needs to apply the function to\nitself but this is not justified. A counter example being lamps illuminate themselves and others.\nThe argument from chap 2 depends on natural functions (movement, burning of fire, seeing of the eye,\netc.) being predicated on the moment of time which it takes place, and when the non obtaining of time is\nestablished it leads to the non happening of the function. This is not justified.\nHere Nagarjuna jumps from how seeing only occurs with a sense object to the occlusion the eye faculty\ncan't see. The author distinguishes between \"seeing independent of condition\" and \"seeing dependent of\ncondition\" so Nagarjuna really only negates the first one. And that negating the first is close to pointless\nsince no one asserts seeing occurs irrespective of condition. The second is left alone.\n6[...] and 5 others\n17 Comments\nLike\nComment\nComments\n[Participant 2] What book is this from?\n1\nLike\n· Reply · 1w\n541\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n[Participant 1] Madhyamaka in China, the author was giving some background on Nagarjuna.\n1\nLike\n· Reply · 1w\nMalcolm Smith\nMalcolm Smith Lamps do not illuminate themselves.

You don't need someone up above to\nperform the raining. It's not that there is the rain, and there is the one who causes the rain to fall. In fact,\nwhen you say the rain is falling, it's very funny, because if it weren't falling, it wouldn't be rain. In our way\nof speaking, we're used to having a subject and a verb. That's why we need the word \"it\" when we say, \"it\nrains.\" \"It\" is the subject, the one who makes the rain possible. But, looking deeply, we don't need a\n\"rainer,\" we just need the rain. Raining and the rain are the same. The formations of birds and the birds\nare the same -- there's no \"self,\" no boss involved.\nThere's a mental formation called vitarka, \"initial thought.\" When we use the verb \"to think\" in English, we\nneed a subject of the verb: I think, you think, he thinks. But, really, you don't need a subject for a thought\nto be produced. Thinking without a thinker -- it's absolutely possible. To think is to think about something.\nTo perceive is to perceive something. The perceiver and the perceived object that is perceived are one.\nWhen Descartes said, \"I think, therefore I am,\" his point was that if I think, there must be an \"I\" for\nthinking to be possible. When he made the declaration \"I think,\" he believed that he could demonstrate\nthat the \"I\" exists. We have the strong habit or believing in a self. But, observing very deeply, we can see\nthat a thought does not need a thinker to be possible. There is no thinker behind the thinking -- there is\njust the thinking; that's enough.\nNow, if Mr. Descartes were here, we might ask him, \"Monsieur Descartes, you say, 'You think, therefore\nyou are.' But what are you? You are your thinking. Thinking -- that's enough. Thinking manifests without\nthe need of a self behind it.\"\nThinking without a thinker. Feeling without a feeler. What is our anger without our 'self'? This is the object\nof our meditation. All the fifty-one mental formations take place and manifest without a self behind them\narranging for this to appear, and then for that to appear. Our mind consciousness is in the habit of basing\nitself on the idea of self, on manas. But we can meditate to be more aware of our store consciousness,\nwhere we keep the seeds of all those mental formations that are not currently manifesting in our mind.\n544\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nWhen we meditate, we practice looking deeply in order to bring light and clarity into our way of seeing\nthings. When the vision of no-self is obtained, our delusion is removed. This is what we call\ntransformation. In the Buddhist tradition, transformation is possible with deep understanding. The\nmoment the vision of no-self is there, manas, the elusive notion of 'I am,' disintegrates, and we find\nourselves enjoying, in this very moment, freedom and happiness.\"\n- Choosing\n“[3:29 PM, 6/25/2020] John Tan: Thought of how to explain the difference in anatta and advaita nihilism.\n[3:40 PM, 6/25/2020] John Tan: When a person in ignorance, why is he so blinded? If there is no I,\nshouldn't him be already free?\nSentient being: if there is no I in ignorance, then you are therefore free.\nAnatta: There is no I in ignorance, you are precisely THAT ignorance, therefore fully and entirely blinded.\nWhat anatta insight is telling us is the \"I\" and \"ignorance\" are the same phenomenon. This also tells us\nthat even when in ignorant, there is complete and effortless non-dual experience, anatta is a seal.\n[2:52 PM, 6/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: The Beauty of Virtue\nThought is movement between “what is” and “what should be.” Thought is the time to cover that\nspace, and as long as there is division between this and that psychologically, the movement is\nthe time of thought. So thought is time as movement. Is there time as movement, as thought, when\nthere is only observation of “what is”? That is, not observation as the observer and the observed, but only\nobservation without the movement of going beyond “what is.” It is very important for the mind\nto understand this, because thought can create most marvelous images of what is sacred and holy,\nwhich all religions have done. All religions are based on thought. All religions are the organization of\nthought, in belief, in dogma, in rituals. So unless there is complete understanding of thought as time and\nmovement, the mind cannot possibly go beyond itself.\nWe are trained, educated, drilled to change “what is” into “what should be,” the ideal, and that\ntakes time. That whole movement of thought to cover the space between “what is” and “what\nshould be” is the time to change “what is” into “what should be”—but the observer is the\nobserved, therefore there is nothing to change, there is only “what is.” The observer doesn’t know what\nto do with “what is,” therefore he tries various methods to change “what is,” controls “what is,”\ntries to suppress “what is.” But the observer is the observed: the “what is” is the observer. Anger,\njealousy, are also the observer; there isn’t jealousy separate from the observer—both are one.\nWhen there is no movement as thought in time to change “what is,” when thought perceives that\n545\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nthere is no possibility of changing “what is,” then that which is—“what is”—ceases entirely, because the\nobserver is the observed.\nGo into this very deeply and you will see for yourself. It is really quite simple. If I dislike\nsomeone, the dislike is not different from the “me” or the “you.” The entity that dislikes is dislike\nitself; it is not separate. And when thought says, “I must get over my dislike,” then it is\nmovement in time to get over that which actually is, which is created by thought. So the\nobserver—the entity—and the thing called “dislike” are the same. Therefore there is complete\nimmobility. It is not the immobility of being static, it is complete motionlessness and therefore complete\nsilence. So time as movement, time as thought achieving a result, has come totally to an end, and\ntherefore action is instantaneous. So the mind has laid the foundation and is free from disorder; and\ntherefore there is the flowering and the beauty of virtue. In that foundation is the basis of relationship\nbetween you and another. In that relationship there is no activity of image; there is only relationship,\nnot one image adjusting itself to the other image. There is only “what is” and not the changing of\n“what is.” The changing of “what is,” or transforming of “what is,” is the movement of thought in time.\nWhen you have come to that point, the mind and the brain cells also become totally still. The brain\nwhich holds memories, experience, knowledge, can and must function in the field of the known.\nBut now that mind, that brain, is free from the activity of time and thought. Then the mind is\ncompletely still. All this takes place without effort. All this must take place without any sense of\ndiscipline, control, which belong to disorder.\nYou know, what we are saying is totally different from what the gurus, the “masters,” the Zen\nphilosophers say, because in this there is no authority, there is no following another. If you follow\nsomebody, you are not only destroying yourself but also the other. A religious mind has no authority\nwhatsoever. But it has intelligence and it applies that intelligence. In the world of action there is the\nauthority of the scientist, the doctor, the man who teaches you how to drive, but otherwise there is no\nauthority, there is no guru.\nSo, if you have gone as deeply as that, then the mind has established order in relationship, and\nunderstands the whole complex disorder of our daily lives. Out of the comprehension of that disorder,\nout of the awareness of it, in which there is no choice, comes the beauty of virtue, which is not\ncultivated, which is not brought about by thought. That virtue is love, order, and if the mind has\nestablished that with deep roots, it is immovable, unchangeable. And then you can inquire into the\nwhole movement of time. Then the mind is completely still. There is no observer, there is no experiencer,\nthere is no thinker.\nThere are various forms of sensory and extrasensory perception. Clairvoyance, healing,\nall kinds of things take place, but they are all secondary, and a mind that is really concerned\nwith the discovery of what is truth, what is sacred, will never touch them.\n546\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThe mind then is free to observe. Then there is that which man has sought through centuries,\nthe unnameable, the timeless. And there is no verbal expression of it. The image that is\ncreated by thought completely and utterly ceases because there is no entity that wants to express it in\nwords. Your mind can only discover it, or come upon it, when you have this strange thing called\nlove, compassion, not only for your neighbor, but for the animals, the trees, for everything.\nThen such a mind itself becomes sacred.\n~ J Krishnamurti, 'This Light in Oneself: True Meditation'\n[2:53 PM, 6/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: reminds me of what you said 'you are the ignorance'\n[6:52 AM, 6/28/2020] John Tan: Yes”\nNeo-Advaitic “No-Practice Doctrine” is Wrong and Unhelpful\nThis is related to “No Actor does not Imply No Action”\nThe Neo Advaitins, as well as some Buddhists these days, teach that you should not do any practices,\nsince there is no one to do them and so on.

It requires people with deep wisdom like Buddha, or like\nJohn Tan to be able to discern this.\nFrom a conversation in 2010:\n(4:24:08 PM) Thusness: the man with the cellphone... rather than seeing it as universe doing it...see that\nthe deeper dispositions causing the frustration. see the subtle holding of pces. see that there is rigidity in\nholding. you know about the fox zen koan?\n(4:28:31 PM) AEN: yea\n(4:28:55 PM) Thusness: you know the importance of it? it is considered hard to penetrate even among the\nenlightened.\n(4:29:45 PM) AEN: it’s talking about the importance of causality\n(4:30:08 PM) Thusness: buddhism causality is the theory of conditionality. you must clearly see the causes\nand conditions. now if you are not trying to 'maintain' a state of non-dual presence, will the walkman cell\nphone pose as a problem? isn't that worse than a by passer that is not distracted by the cellphone?\n(4:38:26 PM) AEN: yea\n547\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(4:39:30 PM) Thusness: if you do not see the cause of 'division', can there be non-dual and anatta\nexperience? without the experience of \"I AMness\", your experience of non-dual and anatta will be\ndifferent.\n(4:40:37 PM) AEN: oic\n(4:40:38 PM) AEN: how different\n(4:40:58 PM) Thusness: very different in terms of intensity and realization. most will skew towards first\nstanza. the directness and immediacy is also different. the experience will re-surface if you practice non-\ndual dropping, but not by way of one-pointedness concentration\n(4:43:41 PM) Thusness: how is your PCEs sustained?\n(4:46:03 PM) AEN: yeah its like those who practice vipassana or mctb focuses on the first stanza right\n(4:46:14 PM) AEN: hmm.. via dropping like you said. theres no concentration needed cos everything is by\nnature nondual already, just the clinging to a sense of self obscuring the direct perception\n(4:47:46 PM) AEN: bahiya sutta is a mix of both stanzas right\n(4:48:05 PM) Thusness: by clear seeing, by penetrating the cause and conditions, by letting go non-\ndually...\n(4:48:22 PM) Thusness: bahiya sutta yes...very deep, clear and precise.\n(4:49:06 PM) AEN: through contemplating bahiya sutta experientially I realised what it mean which I later\nwrote in the article...

Your mind/body rhythm, heart beats are affected\nby this practice. if penetrate anatta deeply...from moment to moment...thoroughly letting go of self and\ngrasping and vivid presence, how is it that such practice will not affect the 3 states?\n(5:14:39 PM) AEN: hmm… but in deep dreamless sleep if there is no conscious awareness how can there\nbe an ongoing practice?\n(5:16:26 PM) Thusness: the entire movement is not a matter of conscious awareness. the momentum\ncontinues...the body, the cells are imprinted too. much like your deep held attachments. all inter-\npenetrates. your body can contract unnecessarily. so you may have the experience but you have to\nrefine your understanding. there are still some good pointers. when you practice dropping, it will help.\nwhen your insight deepens, it will help. so the mind can be clear. thoughts create fear... the mind engages\nin story has fear this is true. and being thoughtless, fear does not arise at that moment when we do away\nwith thoughts and stop engaging in stories. but the cause is the 'attachment'. if the holding is there, there\nis no overcoming of the problem, get it? knowing that it is just a thought, engaging in stories helps as a\nform of practice... ultimately, that deep held tendency must be relinquished.\n(5:30:25 PM) AEN: ic.. so you mean the main focus is not thoughtlessness but relinquishing the tendency\nof holding? and that’s by insight and dropping?\n(5:31:16 PM) Thusness: yes. and because there is no holding, no attachment, there is thoughtlessness. as I\nsaid certain teachings are good to a certain point... after you arise the insight, you have to have other\npointers. before that, it can be helpful to get you there...they are good 'supporting conditions'. but some\nof the expressions are beautiful. Sometimes just a few of these beautiful phrases help to articulate\nexpressions… and that is what I look for because it is so hard to express.\n(5:35:39 PM) AEN: ic.. \"Learned Audience, when we use Prajna for introspection we are illumined within\nand without, and in a position to know our own mind.

And I\nwas shown directly that I had been wrong, and that was very humbling.\nThat made these teachings real for me. And surprisingly, instead of continuing to reject practice, and all of\nthese other aspects of these systems that I had previously thought to be extraneous and a waste of\ntime... I saw their value and their place for the first time.

I simply speak out because when I see others who appear to be passionate about these\nteachings, making the same mistakes I made, I see myself, I can't help but to want to say \"hey, it really\nisn't that way.\" And if all I accomplish is at least planting some shred of a seed of a possibility that X\nperson may think twice and consider being open to the fact that they don't have it completely figured out,\nthen that is good enough for me.

I beg to differ... to me this view is nothing more than a license for stagnation and\n550\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ncomplacency which only serves to perpetuate the issue. It is a false sense of security that one has already\n'arrived' so to speak.\nThe quote applies to Mr. J, because he claims precisely what Jigme Lingpa is describing in that statement\nto be true, and did so directly above that quotation: Jackson's view being, nothing need be done, because\nall concepts (including those of the dharma such as emptiness etc.), are nothing more than thoughts\nwhich arise in what is already complete, as expressions of what is already complete. His logic therefore\nbeing, there is no need to even entertain such notions, one is already innately realized. Jigme Lingpa is\nstating that such a notion is an incorrect view which actually severs one from the profound dharma. Mr.\nJ’s assertion that 'nothing needs fixin' is a view he has touted for a very long time now, it is very unskillful\nand misleading.\nYesterday at 1:41pm · Like\nMr. J: My view Kyle, is not that \"nothing need be done\".

Let's say you have a house, and in your house is a million dollars. If you never\ndiscover the million dollars or it is never shown to you, you will have a million dollars and never know it.\nLikewise, unless those buddha qualities are discovered by you in a direct perception, or pointed out to\nyou, even if you have them, they are of no use to you.\n555\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAs far as Dzogchen view goes, such qualities exist in the form of potential only. The analogy Longchenpa\nuses is that even though you may not need to gather the two accumulations ultimately in order to\npossess the kāyas and wisdoms, practicing the two accumulations is like polishing a dirty gem. One is not\nreally adding anything new, but instead one is revealing what is already there, but hidden from ordinary\nsight.”\n\"Dzogchen teaching make a clear distinction between the basis (the time of non-realization) and the\nresult.\nThe real issue which causes argument is whether tathagatāgabha, a.k.a., the dharmakāya at the time of\nthe basis, is something that is naturally perfected or something which requires development. In general,\nthe Sakyapas for example argue that the natural perfection of the qualities of awakening in the person\ndoes not conflict with transformation in the same way the natural presence of the quality in milk which\nproduces butter does not mitigate or render unnecessary the process of transformation which produces\nbutter (churning). Longchenpa for example argues that while the two accumulations have always been\nperfected, they need to be reaccumulated in the same sense that a gem that has been lost in a swamp\nneeds to be polished in order to restore its former luster.\"\nSoh Wei Yu\nDin Robinson\nAs for the so called accumulation of wisdom, you can take it to mean rigpa/vidyā (knowledge)\nachieving its full measure and maturity. In Dzogchen teachings there is the unripened rigpa, which\nis the mere recognition of clarity, the unfabricated Instant Presence (that sometimes John Tan and\nI calls the \"I AM realization\"), and then rigpa/vidyā ripens with the recognition of selflessness and\nemptiness.\nAs Kyle Dixon pointed out before:\n\"The total realization of emptiness does not then occur until the third vision, which is called “the\nfull measure of vidyā” because at that time, upon realizing emptiness and non-arising, our\nknowledge [vidyā] of phenomena is complete, and has reached its “full measure.”\"\n\"We don’t have any misunderstanding. Again this is rhetoric versus reality, up until the third vision,\n“emptiness” is obscured and therefore at the time of direct introduction it is merely rhetorical. The\nnature of mind, as non-dual clarity and emptiness is not truly known until the third vision, again\nper Longchenpa, per Khenpo Ngachung, etc., not something I have made up. What do we generally\nrecognize in direct introduction? We recognize clarity [gsal ba], and the aspect of vidyā that is\nconcomitant with that clarity. Vidyā is then what carries our practice, but vidyā is not the citta\ndharmatā, the nature of mind.\n556\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThis is why the first two visions are likened to śamatha, and the last two are likened to vipaśyanā.\"\nAnd as to the nature of this prajna/gnosis/wisdom of emptiness, Kyle Dixon wrote:\n\"Raw awareness is called vijñāna in unrealized sentient beings, which is dualistic and comprised of\na threefold division of sensory faculty [eye], sense function [sight] and sensory object [visual\nappearances].\nIn everyday people, even if conceptualization is absent, vijñāna is still experienced as dualistic\nbecause we feel we remain in an internal reference point and that objects are “over there” at a\ndistance.\nThrough practice however we have the opportunity to experientially realize emptiness, and when\nemptiness is realized, vijñāna reverts to its natural state as jñāna. Jñāna is a non-dual modality of\ncognition where the inner reference point and external objects are realized to be false.\"\n\"Selflessness means there is ultimately no actual subject, which means there is no actual internal\nreference point that is apprehending sensory phenomena.\nIn describing this simply it means through your practice you will hopefully, eventually, awaken to\nrecognize that there is no actual seer of sights, no hearer of sounds, and so on. The feeling of an\ninternal seer or hearer, etc., is a useful but false construct that is created and fortified by various\ncauses and conditions.\nWe suffer when we cling to this construct and think it is actually real. Recognition of the actual\nnature of that construct is liberating and freeing.\"\nLabels: Ācārya Malcolm Smith, Anatta, Dzogchen, Emptiness, Kyle Dixon, Longchenpa 0 comments | |\nNo-Self is Not Associated with a State of No Thoughts\n\"The association of anatta (no-self) to the cessation of thoughts is due to a lack of insight that anatta is a\nseal, not a stage of attainment. In thinking there are always only thoughts, no thinker. In fact it is the\nrealization that the continual arising and ceasing of thoughts without a thinker that is precious. The 2\nimportant qualities that must be experienced are non-dual and spontaneity. Thoughts can slow down or\neven completely ceased but it has nothing to do with the insight of anatta.\"\n- John Tan, 2009\n“[commenting on some posts misinterpreting freedom as a state of thoughtlessness]\n557\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n[9:51 PM, 9/15/2020] John Tan: I dunno what to say and dont want to comment.

The very moment it vividly occurs,\nlook directly into its identity from within the state of aware emptiness.\n\"Now, is this thought the intangible and naked state of aware emptiness? Or is it absolutely no different\nfrom the identity of innate mind-essence itself? Look!\"\nLet the meditator look for a short while.\nThe meditator may say, \"It is the aware emptiness. There seems to be no difference.\" If so, ask:\n\"Is it an aware emptiness after the thought has dissolved? Or is it an aware emptiness by driving away the\nthought from meditation? Or, is the vividness of the thought itself an aware emptiness?\"\nIf the meditator says it is like one of the first two cases, he had not cleared up the former uncertainties and\nshould therefore be set to resolve this for a few days.\nOn the other hand, if he personally experiences it to be like the latter case, he has seen identity of thought\nand can therefore be given the following pointing-out instruction:\n558\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"When you look into a thought's identity, without having to dissolve the thought and without having to force\nit out by meditation, the vividness of the thought is itself the indescribable and naked state of aware\nemptiness. We call this seeing the natural face of innate thought or thought dawns as dharmakaya.\n\"Previously, when you determined the thought's identity and when you investigated the calm and the\nmoving mind, you found that there was nothing other than this intangible single mind that is a self-knowing,\nnatural awareness. It is just like the analogy of water and waves.”\nMahamudra teacher Gharwang Rinpoche said,\n“Understanding these qualities of the mind—its essence, nature, and characteristics—is fundamental to\nthe features of mahāmudrā practice. For example, in mahāmudrā practice, you may encounter the\ninstruction to not abandon thoughts. This might sound very strange to meditators from other traditions,\nbut if you really understand the nature of the mind, then you will understand the profundity of this\ninstruction. Thoughts are not harmful things in and of themselves. The final goal of mahāmudrā practice is\nnot the cessation of all thoughts. This is not something that we strive for. It is said in the mahāmudrā\ntradition the essence of thought is the dharmakāya, the truth body of a buddha. So, in a certain sense,\npracticing with the aim to abandon thought would be like aiming to abandon the dharmakāya. In fact, many\nmahāmudrā masters say that when thoughts arise, they feel so happy and joyful because, for them, more\nthoughts means more opportunity to experience the dharmakāya.” - Mahamudra: A Practical Guide by\nZurmang Gharwang Rinpoche\n\"Session Start: Monday, September 22, 2008\n(12:31 PM) AEN: hi i replied you just now\n(12:31 PM) AEN: i mean forum\n(12:54 PM) Thusness: don't talk about effortless and spontaneity\n(12:54 PM) Thusness: if we look at Isis question, why is it so?\n(12:54 PM) Thusness: why is there fear and phobia?\n(12:55 PM) Thusness: What is mind?\n(12:56 PM) AEN: bcos of past experiences right\n(12:56 PM) AEN: like something happened before\n(12:56 PM) AEN: and so when he/she experience something (like dog)\n(12:57 PM) AEN: then he/she will react through conditioned thinking\n(12:57 PM) AEN: so give rise to fear\n(12:57 PM) Thusness: you are using logical reasoning\n(12:57 PM) AEN: its like habitual reaction\n(12:58 PM) AEN: or karmic propensity?\n(12:58 PM) Thusness: all experiences that resulted has just one impact, they becomes imprints\n(12:58 PM) AEN: oic\n559\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(12:58 PM) Thusness: so what is mind?\n(12:58 PM) AEN: imprints and mental activities?\n(12:58 PM) Thusness: you must feel it\n(12:59 PM) Thusness: it is not an entity...\n(12:59 PM) Thusness: it is a tendency\n(12:59 PM) Thusness: that is not as an entity...u still have that sensation as if it is a Witness, an entity because\nyou cannot feel this truth yet.\n(1:00 PM) Thusness: can you see that mind As an arising tendency\n(1:01 PM) AEN: the other day when meditating i had a sense suddenly that my entire mind is just tendencies\narising, and there is like no thinker\n(1:01 PM) Thusness: yes\n(1:02 PM) Thusness: you must first feel this truth with your entire being\n(1:02 PM) Thusness: like what Jeff Foster said, 'YOU' are just an arising thought\n(1:02 PM) AEN: oic\n(1:02 PM) Thusness: don't worry too much how it arises and how it subsides\n(1:03 PM) Thusness: for now, you must see 'what is'\n(1:03 PM) Thusness: a thought arises, then subsides\n(1:03 PM) Thusness: then sound, then subsides\n(1:03 PM) Thusness: then another thought arises\n(1:04 PM) Thusness: what is thought?\n(1:04 PM) AEN: just thought lor\n(1:04 PM) AEN: awareness?\n(1:04 PM) Thusness: no good\n(1:04 PM) AEN: its like a kind of phenomena just like sound, sight, etc\n(1:05 PM) AEN: but a different kind\n(1:05 PM) Thusness: very good\n(1:05 PM) Thusness: very good.\n(1:05 PM) Thusness: what sort of phenomena?\n(1:05 PM) AEN: dunnu how to describe it leh\n(1:05 PM) AEN: mental phenomena?\n(1:05 PM) Thusness: haha...\n(1:05 PM) Thusness: yes what is it like?\n(1:06 PM) AEN: images recalled, mental reasoning, arising in the mind?\n(1:07 PM) Thusness: yes\n(1:07 PM) AEN: words, etc\n(1:07 PM) Thusness: but what that is more important, it is a 'knowing' or 'luminous' phenomenon\n(1:07 PM) AEN: icic..\n(1:08 PM) Thusness: an arising thought, then another arising thought\n(1:08 PM) AEN: oic..\n(1:08 PM) Thusness: each thought is 'luminous'\n560\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(1:08 PM) Thusness: first you must know this\n(1:08 PM) Thusness: but if you see it from all previous experiences, you 'see' differently.\n(1:09 PM) Thusness: what is seen is 'An Eternal Witness' sort of experience.\n(1:09 PM) Thusness: is it not true?\n(1:10 PM) AEN: yea\n(1:10 PM) AEN: and theres a subtle tendency to push away all thoughts rather than simple see everything\nas it is\n(1:10 PM) AEN: or rather\n(1:10 PM) AEN: attempt to be the background awareness\n(1:10 PM) Thusness: yes the tendency to push, to relate to a 'center' a source\n(1:10 PM) Thusness: to be a container, a background\n(1:11 PM) Thusness: you must feel the differences\n(1:11 PM) AEN: icic..\n(1:12 PM) Thusness: it is just a tendency to relate back to a source and refuses to 'see' what is.\n(1:13 PM) Thusness: every arising of a thought carries with it deeply rooted imprints\n(1:13 PM) Thusness: that 'blinds'\n(1:13 PM) AEN: oic..\n(1:14 PM) AEN: and the eternal witness is the thought of what is and what isnt awareness right, then\nbecomes a tendency\n(1:14 PM) AEN: to sink back to a center\n(1:14 PM) Thusness: yes\n(1:14 PM) Thusness: but first you must understand 'thought'\n(1:14 PM) AEN: icic..\n(1:15 PM) Thusness: a thought is luminous\n(1:15 PM) Thusness: a luminous arising mental phenomena\n(1:15 PM) AEN: oic..\n(1:15 PM) Thusness: isn't it?\n(1:16 PM) AEN: yes\n(1:16 PM) Thusness: besides that what else?

In thinking there is only thoughts, no thinker. Thoughts are empty and self luminous. That is\nbuddha nature and same goes for all other senses。” – Soh, 2022\nNo-Self is Not Pre-Determinism\n(This issue is not peculiar to Stage 5 but can be present the moment one has glimpses or experiences of\nthe non-doership aspect of no-self, even if one has not yet reached Stage 1)\nThere is a kind of pathology or danger in various kinds of insights because they are partial and one may\nnot have yet seen the complete picture. As you may have seen in my recent discussions, the pathology or\ndanger in non-doership is that one will fall into a kind of extreme deterministic thinking - that somehow\nbecause there is no doer, nothing can/should be done about things. This leads to a very passive attitude to\nthings, or rather, one is restricted to experiencing no-self in a passive way (of merely letting experience\nhappen in non-doership), one which prevents the experience of non-dual in action/activities via complete\nnon-dual engagement, involvement, incorporating intentions, and later going into total exertion. (Also non-\ndoership does not imply one has arisen non-dual insight)\n562\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nOn the disease of non-doership, John Tan said:\n“Nihilistic tendencies arise when the insight of anatta is skewed towards the no-doership aspect. The\nhappening by itself must be correctly understood. It appears that things are accomplished by doing nothing\nbut in actual case it is things get done due to ripening of action and conditions.\nSo the lack of self-nature does not imply nothing needs be done or nothing can be done. That is one\nextreme. At the other end of extreme is the self-nature of perfect control of what one wills, one gets. Both\nare seen to be false. Action + conditions leads to effect.”\n“As to the specifics of your question I’m not sure, but here are a few major differences between classical\n“determinism” and Buddhist karmic causality:\nDeterminism proper necessarily involves inherently existent causes giving rise to inherently existent effects\nin a unilateral manner.\nKarmic cause and effect in the context of the buddhadharma is only valid conventionally, and since every\ncause is an effect and every effect a cause, they are, in a coarse sense, bilateral in nature.\nKarma can be “determined” in a certain sense, but since karma takes direction from intention, change can\noccur, certain results can be averted, suffering can be mitigated and ideally uprooted altogether.” - Kyle\nDixon, 2019\n“Kyle Dixon Dante Rosati we gave volition [cetana], and can direct that volition freely.\nOf course we are subject to our karma, but it is not as rigidly deterministic as you suggest.\n1\n●\nKyle Dixon Yes, we “have,” possess, volition.

Nevertheless, we can direct our volition and intention in\nspecific directions, such as following the path.\n1\n○ Like\n○ · Reply\n○ · 15h\n“ - Kyle Dixon, 2020\n“Determinism would require truly established causes giving rise to established effects in a unilateral\nmanner, thus based on that buddhadharma is not deterministic. Causes are only conventional, and cause\nand effect are bilateral dependencies. Like Āryadeva says, we might think the father is the cause of the child,\nbut the child is also the cause of the father.\nRe free will, we Buddhists acknowledge volition [cetana] but only conventionally. Free will is actually a\nmonotheist principle used to reconcile sin with a creator deity. Thus free will proper is not a thing in\nBuddhism. Further, free will requires a rational agent which buddhadharma does not uphold. And actually\nwe negate such a thing. As such we have conventional volition but are still subject to karma.” – Kyle Dixon,\n2022\n“Author: Astus\nDate: Sat Jul 20, 2024 4:42 AM\nTitle: Re: Free Will?\nContent:\nBeings are the makers and heirs of their own actions.

But what is it within \"us\" that can act or\ninfluence independently outside of conditions? Of all the multitude of infinite flow of interdependent points,\nI assume there is some co-rippling affect, no end to being caused, no end to being effected. Is our choice\neating an Apple vs a Donut factored in an algorithm dependent on all prior conditioning of past experiences\nand expected outcome of future long term reward against short term satisfaction. Is there really choice\nhidden in there or simply born of conditions and situations of our current predicaments. Ongoing evolution\nof genetics, family, society, era, location, culture, and luck.\nSoh replied: “Us” is an aggregation, it is a convention like chariot. That is like asking how does the chariot\nmove, actually chariot and movement is dependently designated, agent and action is dependently\ndesignated and unfindable. Choice or intention is dependently originating also. Buddha taught, not caused\nby self, by other, nor causelessly, but via dependent origination. Not caused by self means not caused by\nan agent, and also Madhyamika explains not caused by the same thing. Not caused by other negates\nnotions of annihilation of some existent self, and also negates notions of fatalism or determinism as if\nthings are caused by “other” with no relation to itself. Rather whatever manifests, manifests due to\nconditions. For example if desire arise, it arise due to the arising of pleasant sensations (say, nice smell of\nfood) and latent tendencies towards craving and grasping. They do not arise due to agency but due to\nconditions. But those conditionings are not the same as “caused by others”. They are also subject to\ncessation. The path that leads to cessation is also dependently originating such as the twelve\ntranscendental links of dependent origination (the one that talks about practice factors like joy, etc), and so\non. Then when we get to subtler level, we realise the non arising and non origination of what dependently\noriginates.”\nSoh: “spontaneous presencing is none other than the Maha (great/boundless) total exertion of the seamless\nconditions of the three times and ten directions, however it is not a linear causality where cause and effect\nare strictly separate with an actor (cause) and acted-upon (effect). As Dogen said, “Cause is not before and\neffect is not after.” and John Tan wrote in 2013, “Do you feel being caused or effected? It is just a single flow.\nNow when we see one, the 10000 things arise”. “\nSoh Wei Yu wrote:\n\"What you said is not completely wrong but can be misleading unless you understand 'nature' as\n'dependent origination' (replying to a post about anger, killing, suffering being the expression of nature\ninstead of a self). Which is to say, it is not fate, or some sort of outside determinism, nor is it spontaneous\narising without causes, but simply dependencies playing out here.\nFor example, torturing people is the result of ignorance, aggression, etc etc. There are various causes and\nconditions as listed in the twelve links of dependent arising. And it is not something that is fixed. By\n566\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nengaging in dharma practice we deal with the afflictions and liberate them. Four noble truths are like what\ndoctor does - diagnosis, cause, relief, cure. Four noble truths are completely in alignment with \"no self,\ndependent origination\". It would be erroneous if a doctor realizes there is no self, therefore, thinks that all\ndiseases are 'just as it is' and should not or cannot be dealt with. They should be dealt with. But they are\ndealt with not via the attempting to exert control or hard will via by the false notion of agency (sickness\ncan't be cured merely by trying to will or control it out of existence - there are so many dependencies\ninvolved). They are dealt with via seeing its dependent origination and treating its dependent origination in\na non-inherent way.\nNow in the case of 'torturing', if someone practices metta, it can help (or if you prefer, leave out the\n'someone' -- 'practicing metta can help'). Then when fundamental delusion is cleared, aggression can no\nlonger arise. There is nobody controlling anger, anger arise whether one wants to or not -- yet it can be\ntreated by applying the right antidote (e.g. metta) or actualizing wisdom so that it releases (e.g. anatta,\ntwofold emptiness), just like diseases happen whether one wants to or not -- yet there is medicine, cure.\nThere is suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path that ends suffering.\"\nJohn Tan then added on:\n\"[Someone wrote:] “There is nobody controlling anger, anger arise whether one wants to or not”\n[John replied:] Maybe sees it this way:\nThere is no one controlling anger, anger arises due to dependent origination.\nWith ignorance comes attachment. When attachment meets its secondary conditions, anger arises. Without\nsecondary conditions, anger does not arise. Although it does not arise, it will not cease to arise unless the\nprimary cause is severed. Here the appearance of “spontaneous arising” is seen from the perspective of\nDO.\nSeeing this way, there is anatta; there is dependent origination; there is mindfulness of the cause of\nanger, the conditions, the cure and the ending of it. There is no bypassing as in “nothing needs be done”,\nalbeit no-self.\"\nOn the subject of free will:\n\"Nihilistic tendencies arise when the insight of anatta is skewed towards the no-doership aspect.

The teaching of anatta or no self does not\ndeny will or the aggregates... The buddha teaches that a sentient being is simply a convention for five\naggregates: matter/body, feelings, perception, volition, consciousness. Notice that volition is part of it.\nThis will/volition can be directed towards a wholesome or unwholesome path. However, also remember\nthat the five aggregates are empty of self - and are without agent. Does that mean there is no free will? In\na sense yes, but neither does it imply determinism: another dualistic extreme. Free will means subjective\ncontroller determines action, determinism means objective world determines subjective experience. In\nreality there is no subject and object - in thinking just thought, in hearing just sound. But there are\nrequisite conditions for every manifestation. Those conditions can be changed if there is a correct path.\nA concrete example: if you ask a beginner to run 2.4km in 9 minutes with an unfit body, that is asking for\nthe impossible. No matter how hard willed is he, he is never going to make it. Why? The current requisite\nconditions of his body is such that the result of running 9 minutes is impossible. Control, agency, doesn't\napply when manifestation always arise due to conditions.\nIt however also means that if you exercise regularly for months or years, there is no reason the body\n(conditions) cannot be improved to the degree that running 9 mins is definitely possible. This is what I\nmean by working with conditions.\nSo those teachers who say meditation are useless are not understanding latent tendencies and\nconditions. They mistook no doership with some kind of fatalism. Every proper practice has its place in\nworking with one's conditions.\nJust because there is no self, no doer, doesn't mean my body is fated to be unfit and I can't reach the 9\nmin. Just because I exercise regularly doesn't mean I am reinforcing the notion of self or doership. In any\ncase, action is always without self.\nIt also does not mean that \"will\" has no place at all. \"Will\" is often misunderstood to be linked to a self or\nagent that has full control over things, whereas it is simply more manifestation and conditions. Yes, sheer\nwill going against conditions isn't going to work – this is not understanding no-self and dependent\norigination. But if will is directed properly with correct understanding of no-self and conditionality, at a\nproper path and practice, it can lead to benefits.\nThat is why the first teaching of Buddha is the four noble truths: the truth of suffering, the cause of\nsuffering, the end of suffering, the way to end suffering. This path arises as a result of his direct insight\ninto no-self and dependent origination.\nLike a doctor, you don't tell your patients \"you are fated to be ill and sick and in pain, because there is no\n571\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nindividual controller, everything is the will of God\". That is nonsense. Instead, you diagnose the illness,\nyou seek the cause of illness, you give a treatment that eliminates the cause of illness. There is no self,\nthere is no controller, but there is conditions and manifestation and a way to treat bad conditions. This is\nthe way of the four noble truths.\n...\nJohn Tan, 2020:\nThe logic that since there is no agency, hence no choice to be made is no different from \"no sufferer,\ntherefore no suffering\".\nThis is not anatta insight.\nWhat is seen through in anatta is the mistaken view that the conventional structure of \"subject action\nobject\" represents reality when it is not. Action does not require an agent to initiate it. It is language that\ncreates the confusion that nouns are required to set verbs into motion.\nTherefore the action of choosing continues albeit no chooser.\n\"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;\nThe deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;\nNibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;\nThe path is, but no traveler on it is seen.\"\nRelated:\nChoosing\nAlan Watts: Agent and Action\nInvestigation into Movement\nNo-Self Does Not Imply Solipsism\n(This issue is not peculiar to Stage 5 and in fact may be more common in earlier phases of insights prior to\nthorough deconstruction of Subjectivity, the issue of falling into the other extreme of inherently existing\nphysicality may be more pertinent to Stage 5)\n572\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSome people fall into the erroneous view of solipsism, the notion that there is no others than yourself, or\nthat there are no others and only your presently arising experience exists. No-self does not negate\nconventional (other) mindstreams, only an inherently existing and unchanging and independent soul,\nself/Self, agent (perceiver, doer) or medium of experiences and actions. Mindstreams are conventionally\nvalid like chariot, while the notion of inherent existence and souls are as impossible and invalid even\nconventionally as a rabbit with horns, which is to say they have no valid basis of designation at all and is\npurely a figment of imagination, just like unicorns. Inherent existence does not exist even conventionally,\nit is an impossible way of existence much like the impossibility of a “square triangle”. Conventionally, we\ncan understand minds and mindstreams to be unique for each individual, there is nothing universal (all\nbeings are mere extensions of One Mind) nor solipsistic (only my present mind/experience exists) about\nminds. However, just as with a chariot, mindstreams when sought for cannot be found whether apart\nfrom or within the parts or basis of designation, so mindstreams too are merely (dependently) designated\nand are ultimately also empty and non-arisen.\n“Anatta and emptiness is in some ways diametrically opposite of Advaita view. We deconstruct \"Oneness\",\nthere is no ontological \"oneness\" or a unifying reality in Buddhism. That would be an essence view, and\nthe insight of anatta and emptiness deconstructs all essence views. Not only does all mindstreams remain\ndifferentiated rather than collapsed into oneness, all experiences are also not collapsed into oneness -\ntherefore sight is not same as sound, no two moments or experience arising in dependence on the\ndifferent sense faculties and objects are the same, and consciousness is always simply the myriad\nmanifestation in all its diversities.” – Soh, 2021.

Further, \"Tathāgatagarbhin\" means emptiness, signlessness and absence of\naspiration exist the continuums of all sentient beings, but is not an inner personal agent pervading everyone.” –\nKyle Dixon, 2021\nJake Karat\n573\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nI once slipped into a solipsistic state - admittedly after consuming to much cannabis over a summer after\ngraduating high school - and it was terrifying. I look back and have realized after reading more on\nBuddhism that there was something missing to the \"approach\".\nThis is where \"No-Self\" is so important to understand. Solipsism could be the result of \"non-duality\" IF\nthere is still an attachment to a sense of \"Self\", in which case non-dual is still not fully understood.\nWhen there is no \"Self\", there is no, \"There's only me.\", perspective.

On one extreme everything is subsumed into a singular mind. That causes solipsism but eliminates\nsubject object division. That is a phase that many people including John Tan has experienced in the\nsubstantialist nondual phases.\nOn the other extreme all self/Self is deconstructed but everything is subsumed or collapsed into objective\nmatter. The world is inherently existing and real. Everything is vibrant and alive but objective or\nobjectively existing. That is the actual freedom teachings. Here there is no solipsism but materialism, but\nalso no subject object division. This is also a phase John Tan went through post anatta but before\nemptiness.\nThen there is the emptiness teachings, which allows us to deconstruct everything without subsuming to\neither poles, all subjects and objects are liberated on the spot by seeing its empty and non-arisen and\ndependently designated / dependently originated nature. That is the nature of all appearance / mind /\nphenomena, empty and yet luminous/vibrant/alive.\n575\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n• 2d\n• Edited\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nConventionally different mindstreams are still different mindstreams but not established as real\nultimately, and also not subsumed into a “one”.\nReply\n2d\n“Why do you believe there’s such a thing as a ‘sentient being’?\nMāra, is this your theory?\nThis is just a pile of conditions,\nyou won’t find a sentient being here.\nWhen the parts are assembled\nwe use the word ‘chariot’.\nSo too, when the aggregates are present\n‘sentient being’ is the convention we use.\nBut it’s only suffering that comes to be,\nlasts a while, then disappears.\nNaught but suffering comes to be,\nnaught but suffering ceases.” - Vajira Sutta\n“The subsuming of everything into one's mind took place because one's mind seems to be the common\nfactor in the mode of enquiry in solipsism.\nHowever if using the same line of reasoning, it is in others’ mind as well. If everything is in everyone's\nmind, then mind is no more the common factor but \"Everything\". If you see this common factor of\neverything and shift your attention to everything, then experience turns very \"physical\".\nPrasangika overcomes such issue by inquiring into its \"inherentness\". Taking the “seed-plant-tree\"\nexample, why is the seed \"growing\"? Is there anything at the side of the \"sprout\" that is saying it is\ngrowing? It can be understood as a decaying process as well.” - John Tan, 2019\nJohn Tan on how the tendency of solipsism arises post non-dual: “Characteristics of internal and private\nnot deconstructed.

it\n“On solipsism, as pointed out by John before based on his own experience (that is, he too faced this\ntendency of solipsism after an initial breakthrough to nondual decades ago), the danger of someone going\ninto nondual or even emptiness without the taste of total interpenetration is that one can easily fall into\nthe extreme of solipsism. If we are directly experiencing our reality like in Vipassana, what we see are\nendless dependencies - seamless and intricate, in such a case there is no danger of falling into the view of\nsolipsism.\nAs I wrote in my article Dharma Body last year: \"...(Note: Dharma as simply a unit of experience dependently\noriginating - not implying any inherently existing material universe [as the universe/dharma body here is\nseen as marvelous activities/phenomena dependently originating seamlessly without center or\nboundaries], nor is this dharma body in any sense a subjective body at all [if it is subjectively self-existent\nthen causes and conditions will not be incorporated nor necessary for any given manifestation])...\" -\nhttp://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2013/09/dharma-body.html\nAlso, as Piotr shared last month, \"...what Soh told me in the past, if we apply Buddha's deconstruction from\nsound example from sutra, then clarity I call visual form right now of this laptop, letters is no more \"mine\"\nthan any of secondary conditions right now, and Buddha's teaching about not-mine and other teachings\nsealed possibility of solipsism permanently for me. Somehow [solipsism] for me it's a non-issue.\"\nHe's referring to what I told him many months ago:\n\"John wrote \"you see, when we say there is no self or other, we can still not see in terms of DO.\"\nI commented: this is very important.. and lately I'm seeing it more as well. To overcome all sense of I, me,\nand even mine, D.O. has to step in. Many people talk about no I, no background, but still there is sense of\nmine... and there are also those that say everything is 'the manifestation of my mind or my nature'.. that is\nsubtly subsuming everything to mind. Even if there is no duality.\nIn dependent origination you totally see the entire formation of interdependencies... not in words but\ndirectly taste the totality of its workings forming every moment of experience. When the drum beat sounds\nyou don't see it as just 'the manifestation of my mind' but you see it as the person hitting, the drum, the\n581\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nvibration, the ears etc... all in total exertion... how can that have anything to do with I or mine? It is not\n'mine' anymore than it is the person hitting, the drum's, the vibration's... etc. It is not only that there is no\nhearer behind sound... not only no I but no mine at all.. the sound itself does not belong to anyone... it is\nthe entire universe in total exertion so to speak.. but it is not understood in logic. You have to see the whole\nprocess and interdependencies directly. Breathing is like this... walking is like this... every action every\nexperience is like this. This is the path to dissolve I, me, mine... only through D.O. is the release thorough.\nNot 'everything is just consciousness' or 'everything is my consciousness'... consciousness isn't that special\nor important. It does not have a special, independent, ontological status. Rather it is the interdependencies\nthe workings of D.O. through which that moment of consciousness/experience is in total exertion. The true\nturning point is when mind is completely separated from mine.. I, me, mine.. the dualistic and inherent\ntendency must be dissolved and replaced with the wisdom of D.O.\"\nSome conversations with John back in 2012 are quite illuminating on this subject:\nJohn: To me is just is \"Soh\" an eternal being...that's all. No denial of Soh as a conventional self. All is just\nhim is an inference too. There is no other is also an assumption.\nSoh: That's what I said, lol. He didn't see it.\nJohn: But other mindstreams is a more valid assumption. Don't you think so? And verifiable.\nSoh: Yeah.\nJohn: Whatever in conventional reality still remain, only that reification is seen through. Get it? The centre\nis seen through be it \"subject\" or \"object\", they are imputed mental constructs. Only the additional \"ghostly\nsomething\" is seen through. Not construing and reifying. Nothing that \"subject\" does not exist. This seeing\nthrough itself led to implicit non-dual experience.\nSoh: \"Nothing that \"subject\" does not exist.\" - what you mean?\nJohn: Not \"subject\" or \"object\" does not exist. Or dissolving object into subject or subject into object… etc.\nThat \"extra\" imputation is seen through. Conventional reality still remain as it is. By the way, focus more on\npractice in releasing any holdings.... do not keep engaging on all these.\nSoh: I see.. Conventional reality are just names imposed on non-inherent aggregates, right.\nJohn: Yes. That led to releasing of the mind from holding...no subsuming of anything. What you wrote is\nunclear. Do you get what I mean? Doesn't mean Soh does not exist… lol. Or I am you or you are me. Just\nnot construing and reifying.\n582\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSoh: I see. Nondual is collapsing objects to self, thus I am you. Anatta simply sees through reification, but\nconventionally I am I, you are you.\nJohn: Or collapsing subject into object. You are still unclear about this and mixed up. Seeing through the\nreification of \"subject\", \"object\", \"self\", \"now\", \"here\". Get it? Seeing through \"self\" led to implicit non-dual\nexperience. Because experience turns direct without reification. In seeing, just scenery. Like you see\nthrough the word \"weather\". That weather-Ness. Be it subject/object/weather/...etc. That is mind free of\nseeing \"things\" existing inherently. Experience turns vivid direct and releasing. But I don't want you to keep\nparticipating idle talk and neglect practice… always over emphasizing unnecessarily. What happens to\nexperience?\nSoh: you mean after anatta? Direct, luminous, but no ground of abiding (like some inherent awareness).\nJohn: And what do you mean by that?\nSoh: Means there are only transient six sense streams experience, in seen just seen, etc. Nothing extra.\nJohn: Six stream experiences is just a convenient raft. Nothing ultimate. Not only must you see that there\nis no Seer + seeing + seen… you must see the immense connectedness. Implicit Non-dual in experience in\nanatta to you means what?” - Soh, 2014\n“Buddha never used the term \"self\" to refer to an unconditioned, permanent, ultimate entity. He also never\nasserted that there was no conventional \"self,\" the subject of transactional discourse. So, it is very clear in\nthe sutras that the Buddha negated an ultimate self and did not negate a conventional self.” – Dzogchen\nteacher Acarya Malcolm Smith, 2020\n“Anatman is the negation of an unconditioned, permanent, ultimate entity that moves from one temporary\nbody to another. It is not the negation of \"Sam,\" \"Fred,\" or \"Jane\" used as a conventional designation for a\ncollection of aggregates. Since the Buddha clearly states in many Mahāyāna sūtras, \"all phenomena\" are\nnot self, and since everything is included there, including buddhahood, therefore, there are no phenomena\nthat can be called a self, and since there are nothing outside of all phenomena, a \"self,\" other than an\narbitrary designation, does not exist.”\n- Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith\nMore on the teaching of conventional self:\n“ https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/Shobogenzo%20complete.pd\nf\n583\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nUnderlying the whole of Dōgen’s presentation is his own experience of no longer being attached to any\nsense of a personal self that exists independent of time and of other beings, an experience which is part\nand parcel of his ‘dropping off of body and mind’. From this perspective of his, anything having existence—\nwhich includes every thought and thing—is inextricably bound to time, indeed, can be said to ‘be time’, for\nthere is no thought or thing that exists independent of time. Time and being are but two aspects of the\nsame thing, which is the interrelationship of anicca, ‘the ever-changing flow of time’ and anatta, ‘the absence\nof any permanent self existing within or independent of this flow of time’. Dōgen has already voiced this\nperspective in Discourse 1: A Discourse on Doing One’s Utmost in Practicing the Way of the Buddhas\n(Bendōwa), and in Discourse 3: On the Spiritual Question as It Manifests Before Your Very Eyes (Genjō Kōan),\nwhere he discussed the Shrenikan view of an ‘eternal self ’ and the Buddhist perception of ‘no permanent\nself ’.\nIn the present discourse, Dōgen uses as his central text a poem by Great Master Yakusan Igen, the Ninth\nChinese Ancestor in the Sōtō Zen lineage. In the Chinese version, each line of this poem begins with the\nword uji, which functions to introduce a set of couplets describing temporary conditions that appear to be\ncontrastive, but which, in reality, do not stand against each other. These conditions comprise what might\nbe referred to as ‘an I at some moment of time’; this is a use of the word ‘I’ that does not refer to some\n‘permanent self ’, abiding unchanged over time (as the Shrenikans maintained) but to a particular set of\ntransient conditions at a particular time. In other words, there is no permanent, unchanging ‘Yakusan’, only\na series of ever-changing conditions, one segment of which is perceived as ‘a sentient being’, which is, for\nconvenience, conventionally referred to as ‘Yakusan’. Both Yakusan and Dōgen understand uji (in its sense\nof ‘that which exists at some time’) as a useful way of expressing the condition of anatta, and in this sense\nit is used to refer to a state of ‘being’ that is neither a ‘permanent self ’ nor something separate from ‘other’;\nit is the ‘I’ referred to in one description of a kenshō experience (that is, the experiencing of one’s Buddha\nNature) as ‘the whole universe becoming I’. Hence, when the false notion of ‘having a permanent self ’ is\nabandoned, then what remains is just uji, ‘the time when some form of being persists’.\nAfter presenting Yakusan’s poem, Dōgen focuses on that aspect of the poem that does not deal with\nmetaphors, images, symbols, etc., and which is the one element in the poem that readers are most likely\nto pay small heed to: the phrase uji itself. His opening statement encapsulates the whole of what he is\ntalking about in this text, namely: “The phrase ‘for the time being’ implies that time in its totality is what\nexistence is, and that existence in all its occurrences is what time is.”\n“Why do you believe there’s such a thing as a ‘sentient being’?\nMāra, is this your theory?\nThis is just a pile of conditions,\nyou won’t find a sentient being here.\nWhen the parts are assembled\nwe use the word ‘chariot’.\n584\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSo too, when the aggregates are present\n‘sentient being’ is the convention we use.\nBut it’s only suffering that comes to be,\nlasts a while, then disappears.\nNaught but suffering comes to be,\nnaught but suffering ceases.” - Vajira Sutta\nJohn Tan, 2007: “No-self does not need observation. No-self is a form of realisation. To observe is to track\nthe 'self': where is it, what is it - that 'sense of self', who, where and what... till we thoroughly understood it\nis an illusion, till we know there is awareness, but there never was a 'Self/self'. Isn't awareness 'self'? Well,\nyou can say so if you insist...ehehhe\n(1:59 PM) Thusness: if there is non-dual, no background, no mine and 'I', impermanence, not a form of\nentity and yet we still want to call it 'Self', so be it. :P\n(1:59 PM) Thusness: its okie...\n(1:59 PM) Thusness: lol”\nJohn Tan, 2020: “Brahman or not doesn't matter as long Brahman is not any transpersonal being in a\nwonderland, but is the very relative phenomena that we misunderstood.”\nJohn Tan, 2020: “I am not against the idea of substratum as if there is nothing, but [against] the idea that\napart from the ongoing appearances, there is truly existing ‘something’ like a mirror and its reflections.\nSubstratum is a convention. It is like body and the dancing sensation I told Andre. The substratum is just a\nconvention for these ongoing appearances. It was expressed that way due to language structure.”\nWhen asked about the difference between an ultimate and inherently existing Self and the Buddhist view\nof “mindstreams”, Soh replied with a quotation from Ven. Hui-feng: “Venerable Hui-Feng nicely explains\nthe difference between the view of \"atman\" and \"mindstream\" (as taught by Buddha):\nIn short:\n\"self\" = \"atman\" / \"pudgala\" / \"purisa\" / etc.\n--> permanent, blissful, autonomous entity, totally unaffected by any conditioned phenomena\n\"mind\" = \"citta\" / \"manas\" / \"vijnana\" / etc.\n--> stream of momentarily arising and ceasing states of consciousness, thus not an entity, each of which\nis conditioned by sense organ, sense object and preceding mental states\nNeither are material.\n585\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThat's a brief overview, lot's of things to nit pick at, but otherwise it'll require a 1000 page monograph\nto make everyone happy.\nYou'll need to study up on \"dependent origination\" (pratitya-samutpada) to get into any depth to\nanswer your questions.”\n“[9:56 AM, 4/16/2021] Soh Wei Yu: This is nondual https://www.spiritualteachers.org/what-is-\nenlightenment/\n[10:00 AM, 4/16/2021] William Lim: Thanks... it was useful to focus and unpack one topic at a time.

Being ‘alone’ or lonely is a feature of being a self: ‘I’, the identity, am inside the body\nlooking out through ‘my’ eyes as if looking out through a window, listening through ‘my’ ears as if they\nwere microphones, tasting through ‘my’ tongue, touching through ‘my’ skin, smelling through ‘my’ nose,\nand thinking through ‘my’ brain. Of course ‘I’ must feel isolated, alienated, alone and lonely, for ‘I’ am cut\noff from the magnificence of the actual world ... the world as-it-is.\nRESPONDENT: I didn’t mean lonely by alone.\nRICHARD: One of the hallmarks of self-realisation is to no longer feel the common or garden variety of\nloneliness but to experience the utter aloneness of being ‘The One With No Other’; the mystical literature\nabounds with descriptions of the master being alone ... in its root meaning of ‘all+one’ (ME ‘al one’ from\n‘al ane’ from OE ‘al ana’ from ‘al an’ where ‘al’=‘all’ and ‘ana’/‘an’=‘one’). And I am not necessarily being\npedagogic by digging around in the dictionaries ... for example:\n• [Spiritual Seeker]: ‘Contrary to what you have said, Krishnamurti never says that he has a Soul, a Self.\n• [Richard]: ‘I beg to differ: [quote]: ‘I maintain that the only spirituality is the incorruptibility of the self which\nis eternal ... this is the absolute, unconditioned Truth which is Life itself’. [end quote].\n• [Spiritual Seeker]: ‘His use of ‘sacred’ and ‘holy’ do not make him so, though you use the dictionary to establish\nyour point.

For\nexample, ‘alone’ he made to mean ‘all one’.\n• [Richard]: ‘Once again, I beg to differ: he did not make ‘alone’ mean ‘all one’ at all ... etymologically it\nalready means ‘all one’.\nThe mystical quality applied to ‘alone’ has popularly come to mean ‘we are all one’ ... but the master is\nindeed alone in the sense of being solitary. In solipsism only oneself exists – there is no ‘others’ – and in\nsome of the more archaic religions this gives rise to speculation that their god or goddess dreams\nuniverses peopled with beings for amusement or sport ... out of loneliness and/or boredom. Speaking\npersonally, I was alone for eleven years – but never lonely – and one of the first things I noticed, upon\nbreaking free of the massive delusion of godliness, was the ending of aloneness ... and I am still never,\never lonely.

Rather than to talk about it as if we're talking about One Mind.”\nAndré A. Pais wrote in 2023:\n“REFLECTIONS ON SOLIPSISM\nSolipsism is based on the idea that \"only I exist\" or \"only this experience exists\" or \"only this exists.\" Some\nof these expressions are subtler than others, but all amount more or less to the same. It is true that\nnothing in experience directly affirms anything other than experience itself. What is overlooked is that\nnothing in experience actually denies anything \"outside\" experience either. Experience is totally mute,\ntotally silent - it says nothing whatsoever about anything (be it internal or external to it). Even concepts\nare utterly silent, since, in a final sense, they don't point to anything either - they are mere sounds,\nvibrations, images, etc. In this sense, experience - and even conceptual processes - is totally incapable of\nrefuting or establishing solipsism.\nSolipsism is also based on a half-baked intuition of non-duality. The very concepts of \"this\" or \"I\" or \"mine\"\ndepend on their opposites. So, by saying that \"only this exists\" I'm already establishing its opposite - some\n\"that\" that is nonexistent. \"Existent-this\" vs. \"nonexistent-that\" is a dualistic stance, making solipsism\ninherently self-refuting. Experience is devoid of \"other\" or \"thatness,\" but it too is devoid of \"me/mine\" or\n\"thisness.\" There is nothing exclusivistic in experience - there is no exclusion of anything. It's rather the\nopposite, experience is intrinsically open-ended, expansive and accommodating - even of concepts\npositing closed, constricted and excluding attitudes.\nAlso, solipsism seems to be based on notions of limited space and mutual exclusion of experiences. There\nis a sense of \"there is only here\" and so a \"there\" is excluded. Again this is dualistic, as without the notion\nof \"there\" there can't be a \"here\" either. So, in the non-conceptual spaciousness of experience there can\nbe no sense of \"here.\" So solipsism still embraces ideas of spatial extension, distance and separation,\nwhich it then paradoxically uses to refute notions of \"other separate places,\" etc. So, we have dualistic\nprinciples being used in the defense of some non-dual solipsistic reality.\nThere is also the sense that experiences are mutually exclusive - if \"this\" experience is \"here,\" \"other\"\nexperiences cannot be simultaneously \"here.\" Yet, we can cultivate an openness to the possibility that\n\"everything is already here,\" that \"everything is intrinsically included\" right within this very experience. In\nthe same way that we can develop our conventional senses (or other \"senses\") and experience things\npreviously unnoticed - but that were already present -, we can also conceive of developing perception (or\nsome kind of empirical sensitivity) in a way that allows the accommodation of an infinity of experiences, in\n588\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nopposition to the previously \"singular solipsistic experience.\" That's what omniscience seems to entail - a\nnon-conflicting appreciation of the totality of experiences, a full embrace of the entirety of the space-time\ndisplay. In cutting through the solidity and seemingly exclusivistic nature of space and time - what is\n\"here\" is not \"there,\" what is \"now\" cannot be \"then\" -, the \"whole field\" can become naturally manifest.\nThe sections of our experiential field that seem more obscure and concealing (like the sense of past and\nfuture experiences, and the notions of beyond the horizon and behind/bellow/above \"me\"), which are all\ninstances of some type of impenetrable not-knowing, can be seen as representatives, clues or empirical\n\"handles\" that can serve as portals or doorways into the infinite dimensions of experience that remain\nunrevealed and unaccommodated. \"Other times\" and \"other places,\" even in infinitely cosmic scales, can\nbe seen as mere subtler dimensions - and yet unappreciated - of what is already here, of \"this very\nexperience.\"\nAnother angle of exploration is to consider if \"this sole experience\" is either one or many. A \"many\" can\nonly be composed of a plurality of \"ones\" or units. Yet, no unit or singularity can ever be found - it's a\nlogical and empirical impossibility. So, notions of singularity and plurality fall apart, and thus solipsism\nfalls apart, since it is based on the idea of being the \"singularly existing thing.\" Also, if \"this experience\"\nwas the only existing thing, where would the seemingly diversity of experience come from? It either\ncomes from something else (refuting solipsism) or it is generated \"internally,\" in which case \"this sole\nexperience\" is itself already a pluralistic experience.\nAlso, in the absence of a sense of there being some singular observer, experience is understood as \"self-\nluminous\" and \"self-knowing\"; why then can't the diversity of experience be already a case for so-called\nmultiple perceivers or observers? Solipsism is based on the idea that \"only I perceive\" - but if all objects\n(material, mental or emotional) are already \"self-knowing\" and \"naturally luminous,\" how can there be a\nsense of \"only I perceive\"? Experience is not intrinsically one for it arises as diversity; and it is not\nintrinsically many, since it's embraced by utter intimacy and non-separation. Solipsism, being based on\nsolid notions of singularity and plurality, is incapable of appreciating the transparency and spaciousness\nof experience; and it is incapable of appreciating the fine balance of appearance-emptiness, a luminous\ndisplay that is beyond materialistic, solidified and dualistic tendencies - that is, in fact, beyond all notions\nwhatsoever, be they dual, non-dual, both or neither. Solipsism seems to be a classical example of an\nattempt to interpret an utterly transcendent and unlimited reality by making use of somewhat mystical\nand yet still conventional and limited notions and perspectives.”\nThe Lucknow Disease\nGenerally Buddhists don’t have this issue, the neo-Advaitins have this issue.\n\"The Lucknow Disease\nLinguistic malady befalling seekers at neo-advaita satsangs, from a manner of speech first observed in\nLucknow, India in the early 1990's.

The convention is a tool for communication and given that we are already functioning on the\npremise that everything is empty, the convention in question is ultimately treated as an inference.\nTherefore there is freedom to employ whatever convention is fitting to the context, as long as it is\naccurate in its application.\nIn this sense you can say the conventional identity realizes emptiness and this is not an assertion that\nactually reifies said identity.\nIn another context the inclusion of an agent, identity or entity related to the realization of emptiness is\nalso extraneous. The process of delusion and the cessation of delusion is in one sense, a completely\nagentless process.\n590\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nHence the famous “Luminous, monks, is the mind.

So, it is very clear in\nthe sutras that the Buddha negated an ultimate self and did not negate a conventional self.” – Dzogchen\nteacher Acarya Malcolm Smith, 2020\n“Anatman is the negation of an unconditioned, permanent, ultimate entity that moves from one temporary\nbody to another. It is not the negation of \"Sam,\" \"Fred,\" or \"Jane\" used as a conventional designation for a\ncollection of aggregates. Since the Buddha clearly states in many Mahāyāna sūtras, \"all phenomena\" are\nnot self, and since everything is included there, including buddhahood, therefore, there are no phenomena\nthat can be called a self, and since there are nothing outside of all phenomena, a \"self,\" other than an\narbitrary designation, does not exist.”\n- Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith\n“RICHARD: I do not use the actualism method ... never have and never will (it was the identity in\nresidence all those years ago who did).\nRESPONDENT: Then who was it that just made the above statement?\nRICHARD: This flesh and blood body wrote the above words.\nRESPONDENT: Who is this ‘I’ you are referring to if is not the identity which has left the ‘building’ ‘all those\nyears ago’.\n592\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nRICHARD: The first person pronoun is used to refer to this flesh and blood body for both the sake of\nconvenience and to avoid being unduly pedantic ... the above sentence, for example, would look like this\notherwise:\n• [example only]: ‘This flesh and blood body does not use the actualism method ... never\nhas and never will (it was the identity in residence all those years ago who did)’.

The moment a speaker becomes\nself-conscious and thinks 'I am addressing an audience,' his speech is disturbed and his trend of thought\nbroken. But when he forgets himself in his speech, in his subject, then he is at his best, he speaks well and\nexplains things clearly.\nAll great work -- artistic, poetic, intellectual or spiritual -- is produced at those moments when its creators\nare lost completely in their actions, when they forget themselves altogether, and are free from self-\nconsciousness.\n10/20/2012 11:27 AM: Thusness: All past/present/future tendencies, ignorance, wisdom is in this one\nthought...\n10/20/2012 11:30 AM: AEN: This mindfulness or awareness with regard to our activities, taught by the\nBuddha, is to live in the present moment, to live in the present action (this is also the Zen way which is\nbased primarily on this teaching.)

You haven't got to spend one second of your precious time on this particular 'meditation': you have\nonly to cultivate mindfulness and awareness always, day and night, with regard to all activities in your usual\ndaily life. These two forms of 'meditation' discussed above are connected with our body.\"\n10/20/2012 11:30 AM: Thusness: Yes...and insight of anatta opens the gate.\n10/20/2012 11:32 AM: AEN: Ic..

When the gap between actor and action is refined till none,\nthat is non-action and that non-action is total action. Whether this total action is understood as the natural\nway will depend on whether the insight of anatta has arisen. Anatta is the insight that allows the practitioner\nto see clearly that this has always been the case.\n............................\n596\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nHi James, I think after realizing anatta, the super-clarity of mindfulness becomes sort of effortless and\nuncontrived. Pure natural aliveness and crystal clarity in all six senses. Isn't it the case for you? So any kind\nof contrivance becomes counterproductive. But if you try to practice mindfulness before penetrating no-\nself, it is quite effortful to maintain. This is because clarity is intrinsic to mind/experience rather than being\nproduced, only the sense of self is 'obscuring'.\nAlso the non-action that Thusness said is not merely 'no doer, everything just happening, just being done'\nbut total involvement, total action, entire being is just action, so intention and effort is fully exterted to do\nwhat is being done. It is not a contrived effort like \"trying to maintain a witness of what is being done\", no.\nNo contrived mindfulness is involved. I'm talking about full exertion in just doing that activity like the whole\nbeing, whole universe is fully exerting as the action, eating the apple, cleaning the stain off the toilet.\nIntention is fully included/involved in that moment, rather than dissociated/a kind of \"let things happen on\ntheir own\".\nWhole body-mind is engaged in seeing, hearing, acting: \"When you see forms or hear sounds fully engaging\nbody-and-mind, you grasp things directly. Unlike things and their reflections in the mirror, and unlike the\nmoon and its reflection in the water, when one side is illumined the other side is dark.\" - Dogen\nWhen there is total action, that is also non action because there is no doer-deed dichotomy, whole being is\njust action and there is no doer or acting or even movement.” - Soh, 2012,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2012/10/total-exertion_20.html\n“What you said is very good. I was reminded of a discussion I just had with Thusness about a new book by\nTony Parsons called \"This Freedom\".\nI asked Thusness what freedom is. Freedom is not doing what one likes, that would be still self-view. It is\nalso not just simply being unentangled within the paradigm of duality of subject/object, life/death\ndivision.\nThe realization of anatta and emptiness relinquishes the self and reified constructs, consequently artificial\nboundaries and hindrance are also dissolved.\nWhen artificial constructs are dissolved, the natural, primordial and untainted are also spontaneously\nmanifested in every engagement. If it is not, then one risks the danger of still being entangled in a non-\ndual ultimate and drowned in stagnant water. Hence there is a difference in understanding non-dual free\nfrom the framework of duality and the actualization of the non-dual realization as the spontaneity of\naction that is full of energy and compassion.\nSo as Thusness pointed out to me, freedom must be realized not simply as non-attachment but also as\nboundless expression that is full of life and power.\nTherefore not only the path of non-attachment is seen clearly but the way of boundless compassion and\npowerful viriya (energy) must also be directly felt and lived. Not immobilized by artificial constructs and\nduality, action is natural and spontaneous; without self, there is no hesitation and obstruction.\n597\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nIf one only sees freedom as non-attachment, then one will have missed an enormous part of the\nexperiential insight of anatta and will not understand why Mipham is so insistent on talking about the\npositive attributes of Buddha, yet not falling into the views of Shentong.\nFor example when Thusness asked me what fear is, my answer had mostly to do with the\nmental/psychological factors and attachment. However what Thusness want me to see is that fear is not\nonly overcome by non-attachment but also by the feeling of unbounded life and energy.\nBtw, do you do yoga or any form of energy practice?” – Soh, 2016\nPossible Dangers and Sidetracks of Stage 5\n● Falling into reification of the physical like Actual Freedom teachings:\nAfter Anatta, luminous radiance or aliveness is naturally experienced in the foreground as everything:\nmountains, rivers, sky, etc. The luminosity becomes natural, effortless and very intense, however the\ntendency to reify the physical body and physical world as truly existing, solid, inherent is strong.\n“I am the universe’s experience of itself. The limpid and lucid perfection and purity of being here now, as-I-\nam, is akin to the crystalline perfection and purity seen in a dew-drop hanging from the tip of a leaf in the\nearly-morning sunshine; the sunrise strikes the transparent dew-drop with its warming rays, highlighting\nthe flawless correctness of the tear-drop shape with its bellied form. One is left almost breathless with\nwonder at the immaculate simplicity so exemplified ... and everyone I have spoken with has experienced\nthis impeccable purity and perfection in some way or another at varying stages in their life... ...‘Where you\nsay ‘the outside world’ again you are speaking of the reality which the identity within creates ... in actuality\none does not perceive the world ‘by our senses’ as one is the senses. The whole point of actualism is the\ndirect experience of actuality: as this flesh and blood body only what one is (what not ‘who’) is these eyes\nseeing, these ears hearing, this tongue tasting, this skin touching and this nose smelling – and no separative\nidentity (no ‘I’/ ‘me’) means no separation – whereas ‘I’/ ‘me’, a psychological/ psychic entity, am inside the\nbody busily creating an inner world and an outer world and looking out through ‘my’ eyes upon ‘my’ outer\nworld as if looking out through a window, listening to ‘my’ outer world through ‘my’ ears as if they were\nmicrophones, tasting ‘my’ outer world through ‘my’ tongue, touching ‘my’ outer world through ‘my’ skin and\nsmelling ‘my’ outer world through ‘my’ nose ... plus adding all kinds of emotional/ psychological baggage to\nwhat is otherwise the bare sensory experience of the flesh and blood body. That identity (‘I’/ ‘me’) is forever\ncut-off from the actual ... from the world as-it-is.” “Everything and everyone has a lustre, a brilliance, a\nvividness, an intensity and a marvellous, wondrous vitality that makes everything alive and sparkling ... even\nthe very earth beneath one’s feet. The rocks, the concrete buildings, a piece of paper ... literally everything\nis as if it were alive.”, “this actual world (the sensate world) which is the world of this body and that body\nand every body; the world of the mountains and the streams; the world of the trees and the flowers; the\nworld of the clouds in the sky by day and the stars in the firmament by night and so on and so on ad\n598\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ninfinitum” “This physical universe exists in its own right”, “Only this, the actual world, genuinely exists.” -\nActual Freedom teachings founder Richard Maynard\n“U.G. Krishnamurti: The eyes are like a very sensitive camera. The physiologists say that light reflected off\nobjects strikes the retina of the eye and the sensation goes through the optic nerve to the brain. The faculty\nof sight, of seeing, is simply a physical phenomenon. It makes no difference to the eyes whether they are\nfocused on a snow-capped mountain or on a garbage can: they produce sensations in exactly the same\nway. the eyes look on everyone and everything without discrimination. You have a feeling that there is a\n'cameraman' who is directing the eyes. But left to themselves -- when there is no 'cameraman' -- the eyes\ndo not linger, but are moving all the time. They are drawn by the things outside. Movement attracts them,\nor brightness or a color which stands out from whatever is around it. There is no 'I' looking; mountains,\nflowers, trees, cows, all look at me. The consciousness is like a mirror, reflecting whatever is there outside.\nThe depth, the distance, the color, everything is there, but there is nobody who is translating these things.\nUnless there is a demand for knowledge about what I am looking at, there is no separation, no distance\nfrom what is there. It may not actually be possible to count the hairs on the head of someone sitting across\nthe room, but there is a kind of clarity which seems as if I could.\n…\nQ: I think I am beginning to see what ...\nU.G.: You are blind. You see nothing. When you actually do see and perceive for the first time that there is\nno self to realize, no psyche to purify, no soul to liberate, it will come as a tremendous shock to that\ninstrument. You have invested everything in that--the soul, mind, psyche, whatever you wish to call it--and\nsuddenly it is exploded as a myth. It is difficult for you to look at reality, at your actual situation. One look\ndoes the trick; you are finished.\nQ: It is radical, and perhaps a little dangerous, to call the spirit, the soul, and God the shoddy inventions of\nfrightened minds, is it not?\nU.G.: I don't care. I am ready to go. I don't see anything other than the physical activity of the body.\nSpirituality is the invention of the mind, and the MIND IS A MYTH. Your traditions are choking you. But,\nunfortunately, you don't do anything. You actually love being choked. You love the burden of the cultural\ngarbage-sack, the dead refuse of the past. It has to drop away naturally. It just drops. You don't depend\nupon knowledge anymore, except as a useful tool to function sanely in this world. Wanting has to go.\nWanting to be free from something that is not there is what you call \"sorrow\". Wanting to be free from\nsorrow is sorrow. There is no other sorrow. You don't want to be free from sorrow. You just think about\nsorrow, without acting. Your thinking endlessly about being free from sorrow is only more material for\nsorrow. It (thinking) does not put an end to sorrow. Sorrow is there for you as long as you think. There is\nactually no sorrow there to be free from. Thinking about and struggling against \"sorrow\" is sorrow. Since\n599\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nyou can't stop thinking, and thinking is sorrow, you will always suffer. There is no way out, no escape …” -\nU.G. Krishnamurti\n“I like U.G. Krishnamurti’s descriptions. The problem with UG is that he never offered a practical way for\npeople to realize what he realized. It is doubtful that any of his \"followers\" have realized his message at all.\nAt least with Actual Freedom, by today 10+ people have realized that state of \"Actual Freedom\" of Richard\nMaynard because they offered a practical method. UG's state is similar to Actual Freedom, they have gone\ninto anatta [dissolved self/Self] but fallen into the extreme of reifying the physical. Even Actual Freedom\nRichard claimed back then that UGK comes closest to what he has to report, although not identical. Also,\nAwakening to Reality has led even more people to realizing anatta.\nAnd of course, whatever paths in Buddhadharma -- Theravada, Zen, Dzogchen, Mahamudra, all these offers\nviable paths and many of them traversing these paths have attained realization. This is why I'm/we are\nwriting a guide based on 'Awakening to Reality' blog, for those so inclined to practice according to it.\nI'm a pragmatist and believe for whatever (spiritual) teachings out there to remain viable and relevant, it\nmust have the potency and ability to produce similar awakenings in others to maximize its benefits to\nhumanity, otherwise it remains a dogma or ideology to merely believe or follow.” - Soh, 2019\nAfter initial breakthrough of seeing through and dissolving the self/Self, the physical flesh and blood body\nand universe can seem solid, tangible and truly existing. It is possible to remedy this by penetrating the\nconstruct of ‘physical’ and ‘mind-body’ into the bare sensations that make up the moment of experience.\nEven the term ‘sensation’ can become another construct, so be careful of that. A useful way of\ncontemplating experientially/vipassanically would be to deconstruct the physical world and the mind and\nbody into the sensory qualities of the five elements in direct experience. This leads to deconstruction of\nphysical + mind-body drop. But even this is not yet the realization of Emptiness [Thusness Stage 6].\n“In the Pali literature, the mahabhuta (\"great elements\") or catudhatu (\"four elements\") are earth, water,\nfire and air. In early Buddhism, the four elements are a basis for understanding suffering and for liberating\noneself from suffering. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the\nsensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterization as earth, water, fire, and\nair, respectively, is declared an abstraction—instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one\nobserves how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.[8]\"” (Wiki)\n“This world of actualities is something quite definitely differentiated. It is this that is found confronting us,\nand we take it at its face value. Even the idea of the six 'Greats' [great elements] is an assumption placed at\nthe back of sense actualities; they are the outcome of logical inference. The Shingon world is therefore the\nsame as our sense world, i.e., where we have form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and the laws existing among\nsense-objects.” - Shingon Buddhism, Kukai and Total Exertion\n600\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“First emptying of self/Self does not necessarily lead to illusion-like experience of reality. It does however\nallows experience to become vivid, luminous, direct and non-dual… ...First emptying may also lead a\npractitioner to be attached to an 'objective' world or turns physical. The 'dualistic' tendency will resurface\nafter a period of few months so it is advisable to monitor one's progress for a few months.” - John Tan, 2012,\nAdvice for Taiyaki\n\"AF is part of the deviation (Soh: of Phase 5) looking into purely physical flesh and blood of pure experience...\nSome went into details some does not\" - John Tan, 2013\nJohn Tan has undergone a phase initially after his realization of anatta where he became very “physical”.\n“Also John Tan told me a few times many years ago when I met him privately that he has gone through the\nActual Freedom phase by his own practice without having read about actual freedom. That is, during his\nearlier years in anatta, he has gone through a phase where everything is very physical, and there was a\nsense that he was no different from cats and dogs and trees, physically. It even led to a sense of despair or\nexistential angst. Interestingly, I later found out that AF Richard has also went through a period of existential\nangst in his earlier years after attaining AF, but I am not sure if it is the same thing. However, Richard often\ntalks about the cats, dogs, trees, carrots being of the same stuff as his [physical] existence as the body only\n(not exact words but something like that), which was similar to how John Tan described that period for him.\nPersonally I don't recall having been stuck in that condition (extremely physical and existential angst), or\neven if I had it was not for long, perhaps due to the aid of right view (emptiness + dependent origination).\nMy guess is that (and John Tan would agree) not everyone will go through sidetracks like AF Richard or U.G.\nKrishnamurti after anatta. E.g. Kyle's insight of anatta was followed shortly with realization of emptiness\ndue to the help of right view.” - Soh, 2019\n“(Is your experience now) more physical or like awareness become like a gust of wind or reflection, or\nholographic?” - John Tan, 2013\n“Yes and very good. There is a very big difference between substantialist non-dual of One-Mind and what\nyou said. In this experience, there is no background reality. It is not about the background Awareness but\nrather the foreground aggregates that you are talking about - A thought. There is just aggregates that are\nlike foams, bubbles, ethereal having all the same taste without substantiality and implicitly non-dual. No\nsense of body, mind and the world, nothing actual or truly there.\nBefore, when insight of anatta first arose, you still risk the danger of seeing the physical as inherent and\ntruly existing. Therefore there is a period that you are lost, unsure and AF (Actual Freedom) seems\nappealing - a sign that you have not extended the insight of emptiness to phenomena though you kept\nsaying twofold emptiness.\n601\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAt present you focus on the following:\n1.

Total exertion\nFor 1, it is not difficult to understand now but for 2, you have not directly or adequately replace the 'Self/self'\nwith the interdependence of whatever arises.” - John Tan, 06/12/2011 E-mail\n“André, to me anatta is a very specific and definite phase of seeing through the background self/Self quite\nthoroughly at least in the waking state but there is a tendency that experience can somehow turn very\n\"physical, sense-based and causal\" for me.\nEvery experience is direct, gapless, non-dual, non-conceptual and radiance even total exertion is present,\njust not empty. Almost equivalent to Actual Freedom as narrated by Richard. In fact I find Richard's\ndescription very much my version of arahat .\nFor Kyle, due to his view in emptiness, the experiential insight of anatta not only pierce through the self/Self\nbut also triggered the arising insight of emptiness. However this may not be true (imo) in most cases if\none's view isn't firmly established. For me when I first encountered the chariot analogy, there is an\nimmediate and intuitive recognition that it is referring to anatta but I am unable to grasp the essence of the\nphrase \"emptiness and non-arisen\" there and then.\nIn other words, in addition to self immolation, a specific insight must arise, it is the prajna that clearly sees\nthrough the referent is empty and non-arisen. So anatta I would say is about severing the self/Self whereas\nphase 6 is the blossoming of this specific insight. Extending this insight from self to phenomena, from\nconventions to magical appearances is then a natural progression.\nAs for first bhumi (Soh: related: [insight] [buddhism] A reconsideration of the meaning of \"Stream-Entry\"\nconsidering the data points of both pragmatic Dharma and traditional Buddhism , Definition of First Bhumi) I am\nseriously not sure and never thought of it.\nI can only say if we practice long enough, there is a frequent occurrence of a clear, clean and pure spring\nof joy that emerges from nowhere, floating like cloud. A very helpful antidote for negative emotions.\nEven the experience of drinking water is like experiencing a clean and pure stream of luminous sensations\nin zero dimension similar to a mirage flowing spring water floating in the air.” - John Tan in the Awakening\nto Reality Discussion Group, 2019, John wrote this maybe a month or two before a breakthrough that Soh\nhad which led to the writing “The Magical Fairytale-like Wonderland and Paradise of this Verdant Earth Free\nfrom Affective Emotions, Reactions and Sufferings”\n“Soh Wei Yu\n602\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAdmin\nCheng Chen\nJT only knew about actualism in 2009. By then he already realised emptiness, as in twofold emptiness, for\nseveral years. so nope he didnt take a detour with actualism. But he did undergo a very physicalist phase\npost anatta for a few years before realization of twofold emptiness, all on his own. In this phase it was the\nsame as AF but he didnt know about AF then\nFor me I didnt really undergo a very physical phase\nReply\n12h\nEdited”\n“Soh: as Richard said, the out of control experience can happen even before anatta (the complete\ndissolution of self/Self), that is why the \"doer\" dissolves but the \"be-er\" is still there, but in actual freedom\nboth dissolves\nJohn Tan: Quite acute insight and thorough for the state no mind. Means \"being\" is also deconstructed.”\n(Soh: For those wondering what Actual Freedom is referring to:\nSee A Brief Personal History (of Richard Maynard of Actual Freedom) and Peace on this Earth: Actual\nFreedom and Actual Freedom and Buddhism)\nWhile writing this document in early 2019, Soh had a breakthrough that resembles some of the things in\nthe Actual Freedom webpages. It is not different from the previous anatta breakthrough but much more\nintense, and it felt like a mutation of consciousness/brain/body has taken place and the incredible aliveness\nand infinitude of the total exertion of the universe is now an ongoing natural state. In fact AF descriptions\nare no more a mystery to me, it has become my permanent state, although I do not consider it as thorough\nas what I (Soh) am currently experiencing on a daily basis due to their lack of penetration to Stage 6\nEmptiness.\n“The Magical Fairytale-like Wonderland and Paradise of this Verdant Earth Free from Affective\nEmotions, Reactions and Sufferings\n603\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nPicture: Hawaii\nJust now while jogging.. while looking at the trees I suddenly recalled some of my peak experiences of PCE\n(Pure Consciousness Experience) many years ago, even before anatta was realized in 2010.. (although\nanatta realization was a crucial key that made this all effortless and natural) the wow factor that arise\nfrom the marveling at the wondrous and magical quality of everything and it occurred to me that the\nwondrous and magical quality is very much present as every vivid actuality of all forms even now except\nwithout the aspect of astonishment as it has become a natural quality of experience. It is all so naturally\nmagical, marvelous, and wondrous like I am literally living in a paradise, but without any 'fireworks' or\nsense that some special event is happening. It is an all-encompassing (and non-metaphysical/non-\nontological/non-subjective) Pristine/Pure Awareness completely devoid of a center or boundary, devoid of\na self/Self/agent/perceiver/doer/be-er radiating as none other than the very textures and colors and\nsounds and sensations from moment to moment. The actuality of everything, trees, sky, ground, people,\nthings and events, are revealed in each moment as magical, wonderful, marvelous, alive and vivid beyond\ndescription as in being magical and wondrous like actually living in a fairy-tale like paradise without the\nslightest trace of a self/Self, agent, doer, be-er, being, or the slightest division of a subject and object.\nEverything (colors/smells/sounds/sensations/touch/thoughts) has a sparkling intensity and brilliance of\naliveness that simply stands out.\nPeople not familiar might on first glance think I am describing some special altered state of consciousness\nunnaturally induced through the ingestion of a psychedelic drug or through some intensive meditative or\nyogic technique, but I can assure you this is now my everyday and every moment sober, natural,\nspontaneous and effortless state of experience.\nThis aspect of a PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) or an Actual Freedom is quite well described by the\nActual Freedom teachings (which I have been revisiting recently while helping to write the Awakening to\nReality guide), except I would not make ontological statements about the physical universe as I do not\n604\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nhave notions of inherent existence with regards to a physical universe out there. The infinitude\n(boundlessness) of the universe participating in this very spontaneous breathing and activity is\nexperientially actualized as a state of total exertion, with no sense of solidity or inherency involved,\ntherefore I am free from any such views as rejected by the Buddha in the Culamalunkya Sutta as I do not\nmake ontological assertions of some eternal and infinite universe that inherently exists out there, nor is\nthere the slightest sense that a soul exists at all.\nThen it also occurred to me that those very familiar with anatta shouldn’t be unfamiliar with total exertion\nand conditionality (though the view aspect of dependent origination seems missing in teachings like AF),\nfor there is thoroughgoing and cosmic relativity (as in a completely seamless activity that is conventionally\nexpressed as relative origination) in anatta without the slightest trace of an Absolute. It is in this sense of\ntotal exertion and thoroughgoing relativity and exertion where the entire universe is participating in every\nsingle activity including jogging and breathing, that teachings like Hua-Yen makes sense, however I have\nto say that I do not have the slightest trace of a metaphysical reality, a noumenon, a Being or a framework\nof that sort in my consciousness, as my state of consciousness is constantly completely devoid of a self or\na Self. And this is why when writings surface recently about noumenon/phenomenon, being, etc, I have to\nsay, those terms resonate with my earlier stages of realisation but my current state is nothing of that\nkind, there is nothing like that in anatta.\nA thought did cross my mind just now -- if Actual Freedom's Richard reads Zen Master Dogen's teachings,\nhe might find some of them resonating, but I did not find any reference to Zen Master Dogen's works in\nActual Freedom's website. E.g. http://dogenandtheshobogenzo.blogspot.com/2010/08/existence-time-\nemptiness-of-what.html , also among many things Soto Zen (Dogen’s lineage teachers) teachers write,\nShinshu Roberts wrote the following, “Since our activity is not a progression from delusion to\nenlightenment made solely by the independent self, Dogen defines the first thought of practice as\n'immediate present ultimate Dharma' or genjokoan: the presence and perfection of all dharmas as they\nare in the here-and-now.' Hee-Jin Kim further explains the meaning of genjokoan:\n'It does not suggest an evolutionary ascent from hidden-ness to manifestation, or from imperfection to\nperfection, or conversely, an emanational descent from one to many, or from reality to appearance.\nRather, things, events, beings are already unmistakably what they truly are; what is more, they are\nvibrant, transparent, and bright in their as-they-are-ness.'”\nThis state of consciousness is devoid of affective emotional imposition on the purity and perfection of the\nexperience. Everything is clean, perfect, wonderful, marvelous and alive, without the additional layer of\nobscurity that consists of the solidifying of a self/Self with its incumbent habitual (or what Richard calls\n\"instinctual\") affective reactions, emotional reactions. For example just now while listening to the baby\ncrying, the crying is incredibly \"actual\" just as the trees and rivers and buildings are \"actual\" - not in the\nsense that they are felt as solid, physical and inherently existing, but \"actual\" in the sense of vividly\nmanifesting in a completely \"pristine\" and \"unsullied\" state, the complete actuality of sound unobscured\n605\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nby any trace of emotional or mental reactions, in actual fact completely unsullied by the slightest trace of\nsubjectivity -- only the crying just as it is, vividly heard, with no self/Self or passions or aversions\nwhatsoever.\nAnd this is how the teachings of Buddha in Bahiya Sutta, and its related Malunkyaputta Sutta leads to\ncomplete liberation --\n\"Then, Malunkyaputta, with regard to phenomena to be seen, heard, sensed, or cognized: In reference to\nthe seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed,\nonly the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself.\nWhen for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the\nheard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then,\nMalunkyaputta, there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with that,\nthere is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two.\nThis, just this, is the end of stress.\"\n\"Knowing an idea — mindfulness lapsed — attending to the theme of 'endearing,' impassioned in mind,\none feels and remains fastened there. One's feelings, born of the idea, grow numerous, Greed &\nannoyance injure one's mind. Thus amassing stress, one is said to be far from Unbinding. Not\nimpassioned with forms — seeing a form with mindfulness firm — dispassioned in mind, one knows and\ndoesn't remain fastened there. While one is seeing a form — and even experiencing feeling — it falls\naway and doesn't accumulate. Thus one fares mindfully. Thus not amassing stress, one is said to be in the\npresence of Unbinding.\"\n- https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN35_95.html\nAs a sidenote, I am very blissful these days (not the sort of 'emotional' bliss that is contaminated by\nself/Self, but always a radiant joyfulness springing up spontaneously as a natural ongoing delightfulness\nof no-self/no-Self, happy and delightful and smiling very often), today even more so.\nJohn Tan always talked about this incredible bliss of anatta, and now it is just like that. E.g. John Tan said\nin 2006 to Sim Pern Chong, “Haha...the intuitive experience of non-duality must have made you\nappreciate deeply the profound teaching of anatta and emptiness. The joy and bliss of total transparency\nwill make us drop from our chairs (it can take a few years)...Happy Journey.” He also said \"if longchen can\nstabilize [anatta] in 3 yrs time, he will be able to enter incredible bliss at will. beyond description. not a\nform of mundane samadhi\". (More: The Incredible Bliss of Anatta)\n....\nUpdate:\n606\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSome of my descriptions from related discussions:\n\"Strong and vivid radiance..\nEven now the smell of food is standing out in intensity\n...[sights have a] HD hypervivid quality...\n...Actually more accurate description is magical and marvellous colors (as in the vivid 'textures' of what's\ncalled trees, sky, houses, people, streets, etc), sounds (as in the vivid 'textures' of a bird chirping, sound of\ntraffic, etc), scents (as in the aromas of food, and plants, etc), etc. Complete perfection with a stark\nintensity...\nYet feels completely natural. Without slightest sense of distance or self/Self, even the tiniest details\nbecomes starkly clear\nThis sense of perfection and magical radiance of everything is still there even when I'm physically tired\nand lack sleep on the previous night\nBy magical what I mean is a sense that there’s something very magnificent, almost like beauty but it is not\nbeauty vs ugly and is not at all a subjectively imposed or affective feeling of beauty, but a sense of\nperfection.. like I look at the fly crawling on my skin, the fly is so completely perfect, like part of the\nparadise (note: this is different from Thusness's usage of the term 'magical')\nLike a ball of radiance, except radiance as none other than the boundless world of forms, colors, textures\nand sounds, that is the very radiance, for it is the world that is the radiance and nothing else. Not a\nsubjective radiance standing apart from forms.\nThere is nothing subjectively imposed here.. when I say “sense of perfection” that is already not quite\naccurate as it conveys some subjectively imposed interpretation of perfection.. rather it is the world that\nis the perfection and each moment carries the flavor of perfection\nPerfection being merely a qualitative description of the pristine state of consciousness/radiant forms, not\nan affective feeling of \"it is perfect\" but neither is it an objective characteristic of some inherently existing\nobject (there is neither subject nor object as subject and object is conceptual)\nBut this state of consciousness is not just heightened clarity... it’s like even the trees swaying is\nmarvelously and magically alive and life reveals its significance and meaning all around. I think this is\nwhat Richard calls “meaning of life”.\n607\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThe emotional model of AF makes some sense\"\n...\nDriving around Singapore, it feels like I am experiencing Singapore for the first time.\n...\nI would also just like to add that this luminosity has always been experienced since anatta 8 years back\nand as glimpses even before anatta realization, but it's getting more intense after a few events these\ndays. Or as John Tan (Thusness) suggest, some overcoming of the center. He told me he actually expected\nthat I'll experience this a long time ago, but I was late by 2 years from his expectation\n...\n[9:40 PM, 3/29/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Now I’m walking.. absolutely no self /Self/agency at all.. and the PCE\n(Pure Consciousness Experience) [i.e. the vivid radiance of anatta that 'makes' everything like a wondrous\nparadise is now my unbroken state] is still there as before but the main characteristic that stands out now\nis not the radiance but the walking is just infinitude of the universe as the seamless activity.. in the\nabsence of an agent/self/Self there is just this\n[9:42 PM, 3/29/2019] Soh Wei Yu: [And also the experience comes with a] Very still mind.. except when\nwriting this\n[9:42 PM, 3/29/2019] John Tan: Yes don't focus, relax and be light. No self, no center. Don't over do. Learn\na somatic technique.\n[9:52 PM, 3/29/2019] Soh Wei Yu: yea this cosmic sense of centerless ness is different from focused kind\nof pce.. it’s like PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) is already natural here and makes no sense to focus\nmore.. the cosmic sense of Maha does not require focusing but complete opening without\nself/Self/agent... it created no tension in my head at all\n[9:55 PM, 3/29/2019] John Tan: Yes\n[9:57 PM, 3/29/2019] John Tan: Just centerless and without background, light and immense. No focus no\nconcentration. Natural and free.\n[9:57 PM, 3/29/2019] John Tan: And master a somatic technique to release your body and any form of\nenergy imbalance.\n…\n[24/4/19, 3:08:47 PM] Soh Wei Yu: I don’t need to focus on it it’s just there [pce as natural effortless\nongoing state, not a peak experience here].. as for the cause.. I think a lot. Like Anatta Realization is\ncrucial yet I already had it 8 years ago\n608\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n[24/4/19, 3:09:07 PM] John Tan: The cause of pce is just 1. [comments: what John meant here is not just\nPCE as a peak experience as the term usually refers to, but PCE as an effortless, ongoing, permanent\nnatural state]\n[24/4/19, 3:09:12 PM] John Tan: Not a lot\n[24/4/19, 3:09:19 PM] Soh Wei Yu: It’s more like a gradual building up of intensity over the past few\nmonths\n[24/4/19, 3:09:39 PM] John Tan: Pce comes from directness and gapless experience of the obviousness\n[24/4/19, 3:09:41 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Then I remembered and contemplated on the pce state and suddenly\ntriggered a shift. And that triggered like a mutation of my brain, body and consciousness. I mean in\naddition to anatta insight it’s those factors… I wouldn’t say I had a totally new insight more like intensified\nactualization. Like some veil gone\n[24/4/19, 3:13:35 PM] John Tan: There is no new insight, it is just the insight of anatta. So it is just over\nemphasis to say it is something more.\n[24/4/19, 3:14:28 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Hmm but previously I already had anatta insight yet somehow\nsomething prevented that mutation of brain body consciousness lol\n[24/4/19, 3:14:38 PM] John Tan: The degree of severing the self can vary but the insight is the same.\n[24/4/19, 3:14:40 PM] Soh Wei Yu: I think in addition to the insight I had to go through a process\n[24/4/19, 3:14:44 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Yes\n[24/4/19, 3:15:49 PM] John Tan: So there is no extra insight only the degree of doing away with that layer\nthat hinders directness and gaplessness. however one can get so excited about the effect that is the\nissue.\n[24/4/19, 3:16:35 PM] Soh Wei Yu: It’s almost like a chakra is open or something.. anatta should do that\nand maybe for some they get all of it from the start but for me maybe there were obscurations to full\nblown anatta\n[24/4/19, 3:16:57 PM] John Tan: Because [the] cause is not clearly seen their 2 fold cannot be understood\nclearly\n[24/4/19, 3:17:04 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Even now I wouldn’t say no more obscurations.. just lesser. Maybe over\nyears later even more intense\n[24/4/19, 3:17:25 PM] John Tan: Still far from full blown. That is over exaggeration again. Even inability to\ncontain is part of it that re-force the sense of self. I have told you how is it possible when the body is so\ninflamed and congested can one have full blown experience? Does it make sense? If you are fatigued how\nfull blown can it be?\n[24/4/19, 3:19:44 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. yeah. Nowadays I don’t feel much fatigue and yet I sleep less.. but I\nstill have inflammation from time to time\n...\n“Arthur Deller not that it needs a name but that’s what I call interpenetration. What is so beautiful about\nthis is that, like other realization “stages” or fundamental shifts in experiential insight, it is seen to be\nmore primary, natural and spontaneous than what came before. Before meaning sense gates as\nseparate from one another even if explored directly and non conceptually as pristine, complete, self\n609\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nreleasing phenomena. As this interpenetration becomes more and more “just the way it is” it also\nbecomes more intuitively clear that it is uncaused, free and spontaneous. Here a great relaxation is\npossible. Practice of vigilance gives way to immersion and unfettered enjoyment, but without\ncontraction. That last part is important. Before a thorough examination of the vivid, all encompassing,\nno-remainder nature of each sense gate (including consciousness), what we think of relaxation is still\nintertwined with subtle avoidance mechanisms. So then relaxation is related to personal will more than a\nnatural expression of harmonization with the flow of phenomonality (no-gap).” - Angelo Gerangelo\n...\n[8/4/19, 7:19:55 PM] Soh Wei Yu: By the way the other day I was investigating fear.. then I saw how fear is\ntied to the sense of self that feels like its existence needs to be protected.. but upon investigating that\nsense of self is completely seen to be a complete delusional fabrication without basis and then released.\nIt seems to improve my fearlessness... ...Also just now I see that everything is total exertion.. even looking\nat the patch of grass is the body mind universe in total exertion.. so the infinitude should be tasted as a\nnatural state in each moment\n[9/4/19, 7:25:01 AM] John Tan: Yes contemplation is a good practice but more importantly is to arise the\nwillinglessness to let go. Not through analysis alone but recognition of the energetic pattern of\nattachment.\nActually anatta itself is sufficient to dissolve fear, just how deep the insight goes. Ignorance manifests as\nattachment but it is difficult to uproot as seeing through is only at the surface compare to the aeon lives\nof attachments and we constantly re-enforce such view. Wrong view and attachments beget each other\nand one attachment leads to another endlessly. The \"willingness\" that let go must arise to directly feel\nthe afflictive chain as a form of energetic pattern, analysis itself is insufficient.\n[9/4/19, 8:02:54 AM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. I looked down from tall building over railing.. not much fear..\nmaybe initially a slight body sensation but nothing like before.. maybe if someone push me I might..\nstopped looking after people come out of bunk and I don’t want to look funny I like to just stand there\nlooking at the scenery... stillness, boundlessness, trees and horizon\n…\n“I” am my emotions and fears and the emotions and fears are “me” in the same way that the aggregates\nare collated into a Self by imputation.. even as there is no agent for any arising including the sense of self\nwhich occurs by dependent arising.\nThe sense of self and emotions and fears as a protective mechanism is not necessary for the optimum\nfunctioning of life.. it has served its purpose. Seeing this there is another level of release which seems like\na veil has lifted.. there is now a stillness\n610\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThere is a sense of deep stillness that is the character of the universe.. even as activities, sounds, people\nwalking and everything is happening, everything feels very still. Amidst the centerlessness and\nboundlessness there is a stillness.. both in the sense of silence and the sense that there is no sense of\nmovement.\nJust sitting on the bed... seeing the ceiling, the link door, the fan whirling sound... all these simple things\nare delightful without any other entertainments. And even seeing the fan is inseparable with the total\nexertion of my breathing.. the movement of the diaphragm, my eyes, the fan, the wind blowing...\n...\nSenses are naturally heightened and everything takes on a depth and freshness like you never\nexperienced before. Colors literally appears deeper (takes on a depth that seems psychedelic) and more\nvibrant, sounds and scents are felt with stark vividness, an energetic pulsation of sensation flows\nthroughout the body, and you can’t help but be in a state of wonderment at the aliveness of the universe.\nThat’s just the radiance aspect. There is also a complete absence of self/Self and only the forms and\ntextures and fabric of the moment are the radiance, nothing else behind or besides as if experiencing\nthings through a separative veil, that hallucinatory separative veil and background self/Self preventing a\ncomplete gaplessness and directness and immediacy of the experience of actual that is conventionally\ncalled “people, things and events” is realised to be completely delusory and extinguished. Without that\nhallucinatory veil, the other person you meet, the sun in the distance is seen and experienced to be no\nmore distant than your heartbeat. For no longer do you see yourself as the seer of scenery, in seeing\nthere is just radiant colors, in sensing just sensations without a sensor. This absence of distance and\nseparation is called “actual intimacy” by Richard but a better term would be gaplessness as there is simply\nno one to “be intimate with” another, there is only another - the actuality of “people, things and events”.\nThe sense of a self that feels like its existence needs to be protected or feels threatened and fearful or\ndistressed and any other manners of emotional affliction is also seen to be a complete phantasm, a\ndelusional construct without the slightest existence in actuality and thus extinguished, leaving the\nperfection and purity of the actual and the trees and nature appears as a paradisiacal wonderland full of\nneverending gladness and delight. You smile more. There is a complete absence of grim and glum in the\n“actual”, only bright, joyful radiance and peace.\nThe radiance that is the very forms is always already so but the separative veil and identity prevents the\nfull blossoming of the radiance and infinitude of the universe. This delusional veil of identity dulls out\nperception of life. It literally dulls our experience in the opposite way that psychedelics heightens it or\ntunes it up (albeit only temporarily - but once identity is completely relinquished this non-separative\nheightened perception of life becomes permanent).\n611\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThis separative veil and identity must be completely seen through as a delusion and completely\nextinguished without a trace for the permanent actualization of the gapless and direct radiance of the\nactual and the infinitude of total exertion. In the infinitude of the universe, everything you see and\nexperience is centerless and boundless, even the words on the screen is the exertion of the ten directions\nand three times (limitless space and limitless time), and yet the universe is at a standstill, a complete\nstillness or lack of continuity of something or 'myself' over time.\nThis separative veil and identity is precisely what must be “cleansed” from the “doors of perception” that\nprevents us from the direct living of the magical wonderland of the actual, such as William Blake have\nsaid,\n“If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has\nclosed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.”\n...\n\"I’m now at the park.. the infinitude, aliveness, perfection of everything is strong.. but no tenseness. There\nis the experience that this body and every body and everything is the expression of the infinitude of the\nuniverse.. like I am the same stuff as everything, but I do not have the slightest sense of being a universal\nconsciousness [there is no trace of metaphysicality or subjectivity here]. Neither do I reify some solid\nphysical universe existing out there.. it’s just that the experience is like that\nThere is much joy and wonder.. my eyes are open wide.\nThe experience is like Richard says, I am the infinite universe experiencing itself as this sensate and\nreflective body mind. Actually to say the experience is like this is wrong.. as if it implies subjectivity.. to say\nit is a physical universe out there is wrong.. to say it is universal consciousness is wrong.. yet it is\nexperienced as cosmic exertion\nEverything is seamlessly connected.. and interpenetrating. And the seamless infinitude of the universe\ndoes not take away the awareness of specific causalities, like I clearly know when an ant is biting my legs,\nthat the pain is linked to the ant biting.\nThere is no effort at all in this state.. no concentration at all.. in fact concentration will probably spoil the\nnatural boundless perfection\nI think I do feel light as a feather and immense as universe...\"\n...\n612\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThis state of apperception is effortlessly and naturally present from the very moment I wake up to the\nmoment I sleep, for example when I wake up sometimes a sound is heard and I do not even know where I\nam (the body is lying on the bed but the mind hasn't cognized that on the very first moment of waking up)\nin contrast to the bird chirping or the fan humming as there is simply no 'I' to be located anywhere, there\nis only everything everywhere... it is almost as if I am at the sound of the bird chirping except there is no 'I'\nto 'be at' or 'be one with' the sound, there is only sound. The reflection of the orange rising sun over the\nwindow in the next building shines as vivid radiance with flawless perfection... the radiant energies\ncourses through the body, energising and vitalising my day. All these informs me that it's going to be yet\nanother perfect day in paradise even before I open my eyes. When driving, when walking, overlooking the\nlong stretch of road over the horizon, there is no center, no reference-point, no center-of-reference, and\nno circumference... the whole universe is walking, is the walking, is the driving, where the movement of\nlegs is not done or perceived by an 'I' (there is no doer, thinker, feeler, watcher, cognizer, being/Being\nwhatsoever, only action) and this body is walking inseparably from the entire universe, it is not the case\nthat there is a body here and a separate universe out there in which the body moves through.\n…\nNovember 2019:\nAnother thing I think AF is good at pointing out is that the slightest emotional affliction and feeling tone is\ntied to sense of self (thus the term “feeling being”) and obscures the purity and perfection of the pristine\napperceptive awareness of mere forms, colors, sounds, etc. It can be noticed to have a palpable shift even\nthough both feeling tone mode and non feeling tone mode may already be free of duality after\nrealization. Got a better understanding of this point this year from experience.\nThe very clean, luminous, free, uncontaminated perfection and purity of sensate display without any trace\nof self/Self and even emotions is now my default state.\nThe difference is a palpable shift from experience through a subtle feeling tone to completely selfless\npurity of the luminosity of the vivid silvery colors called table, spoon, and so on.. completely devoid of any\nsense of self/Self and feelings.\nBut it is important IMO to breakthrough by insight and realization of anatta first. The rest will follow\nnaturally.\n…\nDecember 2019, answering someone on what are the benefits of awakening:\n613\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nRight now I am sitting on a chair, looking at the lush greenery and flowers with a cup of coffee but my\nintensity of luminosity as the vivid forms, colors and sounds is as if I am on LSD (I am sober). Everything is\njust so nice and marvellous and beautiful. I can sit here all day. This is my usual state. Everything is just\nperfection and purity and intense aliveness and joy and peace.\nThat being said, the great benefit is that when faced with challenges in life (however i do not wish to\ndiscuss the details), I still feel free and unperturbed, there was no emotional reactions. Then i know my\npractice has been of good use.” - Soh\n“Certain descriptions of PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) and Actualism are now a very, very close,\nidentical or almost identical description to what I am experiencing intensely on a constant and unbroken\nbasis for the past 1+ month (Update 8 months later: yep, still so, in fact even better now). However, as the\nActualists experience an inherently existing, solid and physical universe, it is not completely identical to\nwhat I experience, although on the aspect of anatta and total exertion there are similarities. However as\nVineeto [an actually free individual] informed me, ‘it is my direct experience that trees and rivers and\nbuildings … and birds and clouds and the entire physical universe are solid, physical and inherently\nexisting.’\nFor me the world like a car, a car cannot be found to exist as any particular parts\n(windscreen/engine/doors/etc designated in isolation or separated from each other cannot be asserted as\na car on their own), functions (such as driving), and conditions involved in the driving, nor does a car exist\nin and of itself something apart from those parts, functions and conditions, but depend on these parts and\nfunctions and conditions there is the valid convention ‘car’, that ‘car’ is merely imputed in dependence.\nTherefore the ‘car’ does not ‘inherently exist in and of itself’ as a soul-like essence to be found as a ‘thing’\nsomewhere, but is imputed in dependence, yet I am not asserting non-existence. Likewise to anything else\nin the universe. What is experienced in PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) (or what appears to me similar\nto PCE) to me does not inherently exist with a soul-like substance to be found anywhere, yet is vividly clear,\nalive, and not in any way subjective (I do not subsume them into a universal subjectivity or consciousness).\nI do not experience an inherently existing physical universe, nor do I experience an inherently existing\nawareness/Self/Brahman. I experience a fourth alternative (to the normal, spiritual/metaphysical,\nphysical). My direct experience is without a who, where, or when, and yet there is not just blankness or\nnothing. I think spontaneous presencing is a good term. That spontaneous and seamless presencing is\nnot generated by a self/Self and yet is not ‘inherently there in and of itself’, rather it is spontaneously\npresencing via total exertion (conventionally expressed as dependent origination or conditionality), empty\nand luminous. It is not some self-existing metaphysical presence, Absolute or Being, nor is spontaneous\npresencing a formless entity - whatever arises is spontaneous presencing, always seen, heard, tasted and\nexperienced. What that is not seen, not heard and not experienced, is merely our conceptual idea of what\n“Presence” is. Neither is spontaneous presencing an inherently existing universe, nor is spontaneous\npresence manifesting causelessly/randomly/by chance, rather that spontaneous presencing is none other\n614\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nthan the Maha (great/boundless) total exertion of the seamless conditions of the three times and ten\ndirections, however it is not a linear causality where cause and effect are strictly separate with an actor\n(cause) and acted-upon (effect). As Dogen said, “Cause is not before and effect is not after.” and John Tan\nwrote in 2013, “Do you feel being caused or effected? It is just a single flow. Now when we see one, the\n10000 things arise”. You can say what I experience (there is no ‘I’) is a spontaneous presencing that is\nnone other than a seamlessly interdependent, radiant and empty universe.” - Soh, 2019\nAlso, this article by Daniel M. Ingram is a good read with good advice: My Experiment in Actualism-\nInfluenced Practice, by Daniel M. Ingram, September 20th, 2013\n“[9:22 AM, 10/6/2019] John Tan: Post anatta, there is a phase where experience can turn very \"physical\",\nthat is why I told you de-construct \"physicality\". There isn't background yet there are clearly all those\nexternal \"things\" that are solidly and concretely \"real\". Like \"I AMness\", the external \"things\" seem so\nundeniable.\nTherefore at this phase, anatta is limited to no self, no background, only aggregates and one can\nexperience a concretely external world in constant interaction with aggregates forming into the 18\ndhatus.\nThen when we engage into the teaching of emptiness, \"physicality\" gets deconstructed, phenomena too\nare realised to be empty. So what does that mean?\nIt is not about the cessation of those we conventionally called \"things\"; not the sudden disappearance of\ndiversities into a whole. Therefore it is not a subsuming either into an integrated wholeness.\nThen what is it? How should the view be like to re-integrate this anatta \"experience\" if we were to do away\nwith the dualistic and substantialist view?\nSuch integration and re-orientation of \"view\" with the new found anatta insight and experience are not a\none day event or a year or a decade...it is an ongoing continuous refinement as the dualistic and\nsubstantialist paradigm runs very deep.\nIt involves a phase where you are able to deconstruct the meaning and definition of conventional \"things\"\nand existence and relook at experience. This is not a \"non-conceptual\" state where practitioner is unable\nto differentiate left from right or a lost of diversities or even subsuming into a one whole oneness.\nIt is a phase post anatta and one begin to taste the six entries and exits in a new deconstructed way\nwithout subsuming and with diversities intact, without background. Neither this, nor that; neither internal\nnor external; neither caused nor uncaused, neither exist nor not exist… beyond extremes… that is where\npractitioner begin to genuinely appreciate the view of DO and Emptiness into the anatta experience and\nthe phases of experiential insights. That is the beginning of the integration of view, experience and\nrealization.\n615\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nMost confusions arise because we are too used to analysing things in isolation and separation. Either we\nexclude awareness when analysing thing or we subsume everything into one, that is the karmic tendency\nof essence view… once we realize this habit and see the flaw of it, the mind will be willing to drop such\nparadigm and become open. If the world is seen and experienced from a perspective that is never divorce\nfrom awareness and there is no background and conventional things are de-constructed, look into your\nexperience right now and tell me, what is it like when you experience conventional existence.\n[12:59 PM, 10/6/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Like reflections.. dynamic and functioning but unfindable and without\nessence. Also when I say leg is aching I dont think true existence of leg and aching is located somewhere\ninside the leg. It's just dependently originating sensations conventionally called leg pain that's all.. vivid\nbut empty\n[1:02 PM, 10/6/2019] John Tan: We were trained to think and analyse otherwise. Therefore heart sutra\nsays 远离一切颠倒梦想。\n[1:03 PM, 10/6/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Ic.. yea\n[1:03 PM, 10/6/2019] John Tan: Yes correct. Therefore this dynamic functioning without essence without\ndimension unfindable is expressed in the view of DO [dependent origination] and emptiness. Totally\nexerted but nothing real. Like water reflections.”\n“[7:55 PM, 11/17/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Actually I still find actual freedom best describes my experience\ncompared to many teachings with the exception that everything is empty clarity unfindable like\nreflections of total exertion lol\n[8:02 PM, 11/17/2019] John Tan: Yes AF is quite good\n[8:03 PM, 11/17/2019] John Tan: In experience. However I do not see insights of penetrating conventional\nreality.\n[8:16 PM, 11/17/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Yeah I was about to say.. the way they express seems lacking in\n[certain] insight to me”\nJohn Tan always seem to be one step ahead of me in describing my experience -- when I told him about\nmy intense PCE-like state, he described my bodily energies without me telling him, and he knew I would\nnot be able to contain the energies and will experience energy imbalances (See chapter: Tips on Energy\nImbalances). He also described my next step - the permanent experience of total exertion (AF Richard’s\n‘infinitude’) which became my natural state in the following month.\nJohn Tan wrote on 24 March 2019 to me,\n616\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Not going back. If you want to write a guide, write with sincerity. If you write with a sincere heart, I am\nsure people will benefit as those are genuine insights leading to effortlessness of instant presence.\nHowever, never claim or even suggest the phases of insight are end of journey, that is very naive, untrue\nand misleading.\nAs for powerful vivid radiance, they are normal if you have spent quality time post your anatta insight.\nWhen the center is gone, externally you will feel like a ball of radiance appearing as the world. Internally,\nenergetic radiance will beam through your body cells, vibrating on your crown, your face, dancing as\npulsation of your flowing blood, that is the time you should seriously look into energy practice. If you are\nnot interested in energy practice, just learn deep rhythmic abdominal breathing until a state of no mind\ninto deep release, it will help to contain and regulate and the powerful energetic radiance.\nAs for AF, the immolation of Self/self is simply the deconstruction of mental construct of self as a center\nbackground. Richard has carried it far enough to reach total exertion which he called \"realizing one's\ndestiny\" if I remember correctly. However the same cause reifying the background is now manifesting in\nthe foreground as the \"actual world\", therefore there is no thorough liberation. Imo from the perspective\nof self immolation, he has carried it further than you and his essays can definitely help to guide you. It\ndoes seems final in a pseudo sense.\nFor you, it will be difficult to find a teacher but if you humble yourself, everyone, every event is your\nteacher. When I tell you to differentiate experience from realization and established firmly on the view as\nyour guide, the purpose is not for you to go around stereotyping people, it is strictly for your own\ndevelopment.\nLastly due to the Awakening to Reality group and your relentless advertisement, I have been receiving\nmessages. I do not want to mislead people and I am not a spiritual teacher and I do not wish to develop it\ninto a cultic group . As for me, practice is ongoing and there is no finality. So I will continue my never\nending journey. You can WhatsApp me just don't message me who is at what stage… lol.”\nAfter writing to me, in the following months my total exertion deepened and stabilized. I experienced the\n'destiny' of infinite space and time that Richard always talked about, which became a natural state.\n\"Boundless Cosmic Activity vs Focused Anatta Radiance\n[9:40 PM, 3/29/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Now I’m walking.. absolutely no self /Self/agency at all.. and the pce [i.e.\nthe vivid radiance of anatta that 'makes' everything like a wondrous paradise is now my unbroken state]\nis still there as before but the main characteristic that stands out now is not the radiance but the walking\nis just infinitude of the universe as the seamless activity.. in the absence of an agent/self/Self there is just\nthis\n[9:42 PM, 3/29/2019] Soh Wei Yu: [And also the experience comes with a] Very still mind.. except when\nwriting this\n617\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n[9:42 PM, 3/29/2019] John Tan: Yes don't focus, relax and be light.

No focus no\nconcentration. Natural and free.\n[9:57 PM, 3/29/2019] John Tan: And master a somatic technique to release your body and any form of\nenergy imbalance.\n.........\nIt is good you are seeing the fabrications working together to shape a dualistic experience. That is seeing\nthe afflictive dependent origination, seeing that selfing-activity, duality, grasping as the very activity that\ndependently originates. Therefore there is no self/Self/agent, but there is the afflictive sense of self,\ngrasping and reification in action. There is no actor but there is action, be it afflictive or non-afflictive.. it is\nnot an agent giving rise to afflictive activities but afflictive activities giving rise to selfing through\ndependent arising\nAs for total exertion and maha, that is more on the non-afflictive side of dependent origination, the\ngeneral principle of dependent origination. You will see that the +A expressions are all over in Dogen's\nwritings, whereas the Mahamudra/Tibetan tends to emphasize more on -A.\nI started having mini glimpses of total exertion as early as 2011 but only had very clear experiences of it\nbeginning in 2013 where I wrote about dharma body -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2013/09/dharma-body_7.html -- where even the walking activity\nis as immense and boundless as the whole universe, a seamless activity of mind-body-universe.\nJohn Tan used the word Maha and Total Exertion to describe this, it is about totality. Maha means great,\nbut it is not big vs small, but great without boundaries. Immense as the universe. As he often said, be light\nas feather but immense as the universe.\nNowadays the infinitude of maha total exertion has become a natural, effortless state as an ongoing\nexperience. When you are doubtless and stabilized anatta, you must mature your insight and experience\nin this direction.\nThat Maha total exertion must become a natural state, as written in\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html -\n618\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"A week ago, the clear experience of Maha dawned and became quite effortless and at the same time\nthere is a direct realization that it is also a natural state. In Sunyata, Maha is natural and must be fully\nfactored into the path of experiencing whatever arises. Nevertheless Maha as a ground state requires the\nmaturing of non-dual experience; we cannot feel entirely as the interconnectedness of everything coming\nspontaneously into being as this moment of vivid manifestation with a divided mind.\nThe universe is this arising thought.\nThe universe is this arising sound.\nJust this magnificent arising!\nIs Tao.\nHomage to all arising.\"”\n● Disease of Non-Conceptuality:\n(This disease can occur even in previous stages)\nThe Disease of Non-Conceptuality\nI was looking back at some posts by Thusness and found one that really summarizes the problems of\nmany people (including me, once, and many others I see in forums)...\nThusness:\n(31 October 2010)\nHi Geis,\nI 'fear' commenting about other's forum because AEN will create havoc in that forum after that...lol.\nJokes aside but I think it is still too early to say that insight of anatta has arisen. There seem to be a mixing\nup and a lack of clarity of the following experiences that resulted from contemplating on the topic of no-\nself:\n1. Resting in non-conceptuality\n2. Resting as an ultimate Subject or\n3. Resting as mere flow of phenomenality\nIn case 1 practitioners see ‘The seen is neither subjective nor objective.... it just IS....’\n619\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nIn terms of experience, practitioners will feel Universe, Life. However this is not anatta but rather the\nresult of stripping off (deconstructing) identity and personality.\nWhen this mode of non-conceptual perception is taken to be ultimate, the terms “What is”, “Isness”,\n“Thusness” are often taken to mean simply resting in non-conceptuality and not adding to or subtracting\nanything from the ‘raw manifestation’. There is a side effect to such an experience. Although in non-\nconceptuality, non-dual is most vivid and clear, practitioners may wrongly conclude that ‘concepts’ are the\nproblem because the presence of ‘concepts’ divides and prevent the non-dual experience. This seems\nlogical and reasonable only to a mind that is deeply root in a subject/object dichotomy. Very quickly ‘non-\nconceptuality’ becomes an object of practice. The process of objectification is the result of the tendency in\naction perpetually repeating itself taking different forms like an endless loop. This can continue to the\nextent that a practitioner can even ‘fear’ to establish concepts without knowing it. They are immobilized\nby trying to prevent the formation of views and concepts. When we see ‘suffering just IS’, we must be very\ncareful not to fall into the ‘disease’ of non-conceptuality.\nIn Case 2 it is usual that practitioners will continue to personify, reify and extrapolate a metaphysical\nessence in a very subtle way, almost unknowingly. This is because despite the non-dual realization,\nunderstanding is still orientated from a view that is based on subject-object dichotomy. As such it is hard\nto detect this tendency and practitioners continue their journey of building their understanding of ‘No-\nSelf based on Self’.\nFor Case 3 practitioners, they are in a better position to appreciate the doctrine of anatta. When insight of\nAnatta arises, all experiences become implicitly non-dual. But the insight is not simply about seeing\nthrough separateness; it is about the thorough ending of reification so that there is an instant recognition\nthat the ‘agent’ is extra, in actual experience it does not exist. It is an immediate realization that\nexperiential reality has always been so and the existence of a center, a base, a ground, a source has\nalways been assumed. This is different from 'deconstructing of identity and personality' which is related\nto non-conceptuality but 'actual' seeing of the non-existence of agent in transient phenomena.\nHere practitioners will not only feel universe as in case 1 but there is also an immediate experience of our\nbirth right freedom because the agent is gone. It is important to notice that practitioners here do not\nmistake freedom as ‘no right or wrong and remaining in a state of primordial purity’ ; they are not\nimmobilized by non-conceptuality but is able to clearly see the ‘arising and passing’ of phenomena as\nliberating as there is no permanent agent there to ‘hinder’ the seeing. That is, practitioner not only realize\n‘what experience is’ but also begin to understand the ‘nature’ of experience.\nTo mature case 3 realization, even direct experience of the absence of an agent will prove insufficient;\nthere must also be a total new paradigm shift in terms of view; we must free ourselves from being\nbonded to the idea, the need, the urge and the tendency of analyzing, seeing and understanding our\nmoment to moment of experiential reality from a source, an essence, a center, a location, an agent or a\n620\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ncontroller and rest entirely on anatta and Dependent Origination.\nIn my opinion, the blog that hosts the articles on “Who am I” and “Quietening the Inner Chatter” provide\nmore in depth insights on non-duality, Anatta and Emptiness. The author demonstrates very deep clarity\nof ‘what experience is’ and the ‘nature (impermanent, empty and dependent originates according to\nsupporting conditions)’ of experience.\nJust my 2 cents. :-)\nLabels: Anatta, Non Dual |\n- John Tan, 2010, The Disease of Non-Conceptuality\nAlso related:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../the-trap-of-non...\nThe Trap of Non-Conceptuality\nAlso see: The Disease of Non-Conceptuality\nFor me, the idea that conceptuality is a trap is actually a trap itself that depletes the potential of spiritual\npractice. It entails throwing away a very valid dimension of experience - after all, thinking is part of reality\nas well. And since it is thinking that creates the illusion of duality, it is at the level of thought that illusions\nmust be dismantled. At the level of \"reality\" there is nothing to be done.\n\"Observe and see\" [which is the only instruction you say you follow,] is also doing something. A spiritual\npath without instructions is not a path. And from the moment there are instructions, all of them may be\nvalid, depending on the practitioner.\nThe neo-Advaita has this characteristic of tending to be nihilistic in relation to the path and means of\nliberation. \"There is no one, there is nothing that needs to be done.\" This reveals a profound\nmisunderstanding concerning the nature of experience: Everything happens in experience, even without\nan agent to perform it - the spiritual path is no exception.\nThe simplicity of \"not thinking\" is a comfortable nest that prevents us from asking important and\nbothersome questions. There is \"presence\" in the act of observation, but that presence has to be\ninvestigated in order to make its nature known. Otherwise, we are substituting a belief - in the self - for\nanother - in some immutable and eternal presence. Both ego and presence are obvious and undeniable\nfor those who establish them.\nBuddhism also dissolves all concepts, but only when they have already done their job of deconstructing\nall concepts. \"Silencing\" conceptuality too soon is to throw away the ladder (of analytical thinking) before\nwe've used it to go beyond the wall (of conceptual ignorance).\n621\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n– Andre A.

And since you cannot say what kind of state you are resting in, or what your mind is\nthinking, it is also called common equanimity. In fact, you are stuck in an ordinary state within the\nground-of-all (ālaya).”\nContra rigpa (knowledge): \" Although there is no dualistic separation here between an experience and an\nexperiencer, still the mind is certain about its own true nature, and there is a sense that, “There is nothing\nwhatsoever beyond this.” When this occurs, because you cannot conceptualize it or express it in words, it\nis acceptable to apply such terms as free from all extremes, beyond description, the fundamental state of\nclear light and the pure awareness of rigpa.\nAs the wisdom of recognizing your own true nature dawns, it clears away the blinding darkness of\nconfusion, and, just as you can see clearly the inside of your home once the sun has risen, you gain\nconfident certainty in the true nature of your mind.\nThis is the instruction for cracking open the eggshell of ignorance.”\n624\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“[19/1/20, 10:11:40 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Robert saltzman\n[19/1/20, 10:11:44 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Hale oh sent me\n[19/1/20, 10:11:46 PM] Soh Wei Yu: What do you think\n[19/1/20, 10:59:50 PM] John Tan: I think it is very well articulated.

When asked, who ‘sees’, the practitioner may say no one sees but deep in him,\nit is the void boundless clarity that sees. This certainly does not help and over emphasizing on the\nappreciation of mere experience will not go very far.

Avidyā is not a mere absence of\nknowledge, but a specific misconception, and it must be removed by realization of its opposite. In this vein,\nTsongkhapa says that one cannot get rid of the misconception of 'inherent existence' merely by stopping\nconceptuality any more than one can get rid of the idea that there is a demon in a darkened cave merely\nby trying not to think about it. Just as one must hold a lamp and see that there is no demon there, so the\nillumination of wisdom is needed to clear away the darkness of ignorance.\" - Napper, Elizabeth, 2003, p.\n103\"\n\"Without concepts, experience is naturally present and luminous is not exactly true imo.\nWe can stop conceptualization or even have many episodes of sustained non-conceptual non-dual or no\nmind experiences, still intellectual obscurations of seeing entities, entity possessing characteristics, cause\nand effect, agent and movement... etc continue to haunt us. Non-analytical cessation is temporary.\nSo the freedom from conceptualization cannot simply be a stopping of \"conceptualization\", a clear insight\nthat sees through the emptiness of conventional constructs must arise.\nAlthough the insight results in non-conceptuality, it also recognizes the cause of obstructedness is\nignorance that obscures and blinds, not designations and constructs.\nWhen contemplating DO (though conceptual), not only does the sense of self not arise, it replaces self\nview. Non-conceptual resting is too a means to an end. The end is not a non-conceptual luminous state\nbut the complete uprooting of ignorance.\nTherefore when Dogen rolls the boat in total exertion, there are concepts, designations and conventions\nbut there is no sense of self, no sense of boundaries, no sense of obstructedness between the sky, the\nboat, the oar and the sea...all inter-penetrate beyond their conventional boundaries into the act of\nrolling.\" – John Tan, 2020\n\"The tendency to be nonconceptual is very ingrained not just after anatta, but even after I AM. It is a non\nconceptual and non-dual realization and taste of luminosity that is wonderful and blissful, but not\nnecessarily liberating. But what happens after I AM? One always try to remain non conceptual,\nthoughtless, samadhi in pure beingness... while the views of duality and inherency of an ultimate Self,\nSource, Substratum remains uninvestigated and unchallenged. Insight into non dual and anatta does not\narise until one actively engages in investigating one's views and concepts and penetrate further into the\nnature of reality.\n627\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nLikewise, even after anatta, by getting stuck with PCE one does not investigate into dependent origination\nand emptiness, then all the uninvestigated views of inherency still remain in full force but are either\nunrecognised or taken as true (like AF) or merely suppressed in a nonconceptual state.\nI used to think why the need to engage in conceptual conditionality etc.. prefer to rest in anatta non-\nconceptuality. Nowadays I know total exertion is triggered by contemplating on the conceptual\nconditional relations.. but its not an issue to me. More important is seeing dependent origination and\nthen into total exertion and emptiness. Then one is liberated be it conceptual or non-conceptual. It's\nmore important to experience release and taste of total exertion and emptiness be it in conceptual and\nnonconceptual.. rather than getting confused in conceptual and then seeking refuge in nonconceptual.\nHowever, I believe total exertion can also remain a mere nonconceptual experience, in the sense of mere\ninfinitude, taste of maha... this is the AF sort of total exertion but this fails to see the dependencies\ninvolved... and because one doesn't see dependencies one ends up in a very solid physical view of\nuniverse, everything is local, existing inherently in specific space time as objects and properties.\" - Soh,\n2020\n“To me, the idea that conceptuality is a trap is actually a trap itself that impoverishes the potential of\nspiritual practice. It's throwing away a very valid dimension of experience - after all, thought is part of the\nreal one too. And since it is thought that creates the illusion of duality, it is at the level of thought that\nillusions should be dismantled. At the ′′ real ′′ level nothing is to be done.\n′′ Watch and watch ′′ [which is the only instruction you say follow,] is also doing something. A spiritual\npath without instructions is not a path. And from the moment there are instructions, all may be valid\ndepending on the practitioner.\nNeo-Avaita has this characteristic of tendering to be nihilistic about the path and means of release. ′′\nThere is no one, there is nothing that needs to be done.\" This reveals a profound incomprehension of the\nnature of experience: Everything happens in experience, even without agent that does it - the spiritual\npath is no exception.\nThe simplicity of ′′ not-thinking ′′ is a comfortable nest that keeps us from asking important and disturbing\nquestions. There is ′′ presence ′′ in observation, but that presence must be investigated in order to\nunderstand its nature. Otherwise we are raising a belief - the me - for another - the unchanging and\neternal presence. Both ego and presence are obvious and undeniable to those who defend them.\nBuddhism also dissolves all concepts, but only when these have made their work deconstructing all\nconcepts. ′′ Shutting up ′′ conceptuality too soon is throwing off the ladder (of analytical thinking) before\nwe used it to move beyond the wall (conceptual ignorance).” – Andre A.

Fully anatta.\" - John Tan, 2018\nMind-Body Drop\nMind-Body Drop arises as a result of deconstructing the construct of a ‘body’. For some, this may arise even\nat the One Mind phase in John Tan/Thusness Stage 4 realization (e.g. Rupert Spira wrote about mind-body\ndrop even in the One Mind phase in Transparency of Things), for others (such as Soh) as a further progression\nafter John Tan/Thusness Stage 5 realization. If you have realised anatta but have not yet undergone a\ndistinct phase of mind-body drop, investigating the body-mind construct according to this chapter might\nhelp. I (Soh) remember having a realization and penetration of the body construct - that it is merely a\nconstruct extrapolated out of a bunch of disjointed bodily sensations, and thus the ‘body’ along with its\nshape, contour and boundaries never truly existed as the entity that was conceived, one week after my\nrealization of anatta through Bahiya Sutta that led to mind-body drop. My experience of anatta was\ndeepened and further purified as a result.\n“I was investigating the sense of a body about a week after anatta realisation, then it was just seen that\njust like anatta realization, in hearing just sound and in seeing just seen, what we call “body” really cannot\nbe found as an entity beside the various disjoint sensations.. the whole construct of an inherent body\nalong with the sense of a boundary, shape, size, weight is thus penetrated via insight into its delusory\nnature.\nThis is different from people who only had a glimpse of mind body drop.. just like anatta realization is a\nrealization of what always is, it is not just a peak experience of no mind. I think you should know the\ndifference” – Soh\nGary wrote in Dharma Overground in 2009, \"In walking meditation the \"I\" appears to place or make sense\nof the sensory perception. This involves a body image for example foot sensations are perceived to be at\nthe foot, movement is perceived in relation to the previous position. Once in walking meditation I had the\nbody disappear so there was just the feet touch sensations belonging and going nowhere. Does this\ndescribe direct without intermediary?”\n629\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nJohn Tan replied, \"Yes Gary, what you said is correct. It is only a matter of depth and intensity, ie, how clear,\nhow vivid, how real, how pristine the arising and passing sensations are when compared to the “I AM”. In\nthe case of “I AM”, it is so clear, so real and so pristine that it burns away all traces of doubts. Absolutely\ncertain, still and thoughtless that even Buddha is unable to shake the practitioner from this direct\nRealization of “I-ness”.\nBy the way, there should not be any ‘image’ in whatever experienced, thus, direct.\nWith regards to the “body's disappearance” that you mentioned, it relates to an experience called the “mind-\nbody drop”. There are few more important points that you may want to take note:\n1. It is not just due to “concentration on the sensations, the body image had no opportunity to arise”, the\ninsight that mind and body are mere constructs must also arise and the disappearance is also the result of\ndissolving of these constructs.\n2. Mind-body drop must also come with a sense of lightness. In the first few glimpses, you will also feel\nweightless and when the experience becomes clearer, you will also realize the “weight” of these constructs.\n3. From the constructs, you may also want to explore further what happen when the constructs of “in/out”\ndisappears.\nLastly the practice of self enquiry is not without danger. A practitioner can also be led into a state of utter\nconfusions when exploring the ‘I’ through mere analytical process. So practice with care.”\nDo note however that the dissolution of the sense of body can also occur as a peak experience in deep\nmeditation or samadhi. This is not the same as the mind-body drop that occurs as a result of penetrative\nwisdom and insights that deconstructs all artificial and constructed boundaries, shapes, and solidity of a\nbody and mind. The mind-body drop of wisdom can be a 24/7 experience, whereas dissolution of body-\nsense from a peak experience or a state of samadhi is short-lived and temporary.\n“Mind and body dropped off; dropped off mind and body! This state should be experienced by everyone; it\nis like piling fruit into a basket without a bottom, like pouring water into a bowl with a pierced hole; however\nmuch you may pile or pour you cannot fill it up. When this is realized the pail bottom is broken through.\nBut while there is still a trace of conceptualism which makes you say ‘I have this understanding’ or ‘I have\nthat realization’, you are still playing with unrealities.” - Dogen\n\"Wu wei ding (the samadhi of non-action) is not about sitting and the state of body disappears completely. :)\nThe 24/7 without sitting and the body disappears completely is the transparency I told you. It is realisation\nof non-duality. Stability until a certain stage, one will have that sort of feeling. I have explained that to you\nbefore. The truth of wu-wei ding (the samadhi of non-action) is a form of natural ding that you do not have\n630\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nto meditate at all as all is spontaneous arising accompanied by crystal clarity. It is what I have told you\nyesterday. In this state of wu wei ding (the samadhi of non-action), it is not about practice through sitting\nuntil you reached such a stage, it is rather a very deep form of realisation and the non-dual realisation has\nsunk deep into the inmost consciousness that the 3 characteristics I told you is experienced. Transparent\nCrystal clarity is that state of body disappears completely 24/7. But you need the other 2 characteristics I\ntold you (fearlessness and non-attachment), you will have a crystal clarity free of any idea or sense of 'self'.\nWhat she said is true so far. But the 2 characteristics must be present to experience about wu wei ding\n(the samadhi of non-action). It cannot be compromised. In between the chan ding and wu wei ding (the\nsamadhi of non-action), requires the experience of non-dual. Otherwise there is no way to enter such a\nstage.\" - John Tan, 2007\n“It is true that when no-self is actualized and when the body is deconstructed, a practitioner naturally\nexperiences the mind-body drop. This means any sense or image of a body and a mind completely dissolves\nalong with any senses of 'entrapment' or 'boundaries' at all. But do note that this is not a stage of meditative\nachievement. It is the result of wisdom-insight into the delusional constructions that conceives of a\nsubstantial body and a mind. In other words it is a form of self-view and view of a physical body being\ndissolved via prajna wisdom. Our notion of a solid body with fixed shape, boundaries, and substance\ndeconstructs when we examine it and see that there is only flickering sensations without a center or\nboundary. After which, mind-body drop becomes natural and effortless, not a stage to be attained in\nmeditation and lost outside meditation.\nAnd because this is so, *mind body drop is an experience in daily life*. It is not separated from your mind,\nbody, and daily life. It does not mean your body and mind ceases - it is your deluded image of an inherently\nexisting self, body and mind is being released, so your daily life is experienced in a liberated manner.\nTherefore it is erroneous to think of \"mind-body drop\" as a stage of achievement separated from this very\nexperience of body-mind-world. It is only that this body-mind-world is seen as empty of anything graspable,\ntransparent, and boundless. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.\nMore importantly, by that stage, you realize that \"Awareness\" itself is an imputation on the entire flow of\nmanifestation - \"Awareness\" itself does not exist separately apart from each momentary mind moment,\nwhether it is a sense of formless presence in deep sleep, or the shapes and forms of each waking moment.\nIn other words, Awareness is also empty of being an independent, separate self.\nSince this is the case, it is seen at this stage that the very notion of \"true absolute Awareness\" vs\n\"phenomena\" is a false, dualistic paradigm in the first place. There is only the one suchness of form and\nessence - in so far as each experience, each form, is both luminous clarity (Awareness) in essence and\nempty of self in nature. This is the nature of mind.” - Soh, 2013\n631\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Like when backdropped self is seen through, mind-body dropped came later. Also “hereness” and\n“nowness” aren’t deconstructed at the time of “no self”.\nSimilarly lately about the relationships between “body”, “consciousness” and “vayu” (Soh: Tibetan word for\n‘wind’, in Dzogchen wind and mind are seen as synonymous) aren’t too. The seeming relationships of “cause\nand effect” among them seems real, intimate until one realises that the diversities of vayu are just one’s\nmind and mind is empty, then the “relationship” disappears, the gap between them disappears.\nSo like the above case, after a few decades, one can still be so attached and affected unknowingly until\ncertain 缘 (conditions) that allows one to see through” - John Tan, 2018\n“Before inquiring into a new way of listening, let me just share the joy of walking through the fields and\nwoods on this extraordinary land. Just stepping out of the reception area, closing the door behind me,\nwalking away from the overhang that shields one from the sun and rain, there isn’t any enclosure left—not\neven a body!\nAll I am is the birds singing and fluttering, bare branches swaying in the breeze, the ground partly frozen\nyet melting, the pond covered with a thin layer of ice, and the blue hills, sky and wandering clouds within\nclose reach. There is also a throbbing heart and the people walking on the path. Even those who are not\nhere—aren’t we all together this one moment—beholding everything out of stillness?” - Toni Packer, The\nWonder of Presence\n“Your movement of thought interferes with the process of touch, just as it does with the other senses.\nAnything you touch is always translated as 'hard', 'soft', 'warm', 'cold', 'wet', 'dry', and so on.\nYou do not realize it, but it is your thinking that creates your own body. Without this thought process there\nis no body consciousness -- which is to say there is no body at all. My body exists for other people; it does\nnot exist for me; there are only isolated points of contact, impulses of touch which are not tied together by\nthought. So the body is not different from the objects around it; it is a set of sensations like any others.\nYour body does not belong to you.\nPerhaps I can give you the 'feel' of this. I sleep four hours at night, no matter what time I go to bed. Then I\nlie in bed until morning fully awake. I don't know what is lying there in the bed; I don't know whether I'm\nlying on my left side or my right side -- for hours and hours I lie like this. If there is any noise outside -- a\nbird or something -- it just echoes in me. I listen to the \"flub-dub-flub-dub\" of my heart and don't know\nwhat it is. There is no body between the two sheets -- the form of the body is not there. If the question is\nasked, \"What is in there?\" there is only an awareness of the points of contact, where the body is in contact\nwith the bed and the sheets, and where it is in contact with itself, at the crossing of the legs, for example.\nThere are only the sensations of touch from these points of contact, and the rest of the body is not there.\nThere is some kind of heaviness, probably the gravitational pull, something very vague. There is nothing\n632\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ninside which links up these things. Even if the eyes are open and looking at the whole body, there are still\nonly the points of contact, and they have no connection with what I am looking at. If I want to try to link up\nthese points of contact into the shape of my own body, probably I will succeed, but by the time it is\ncompleted the body is back in the same situation of different points of contact. The linkage cannot stay. It\nis the same sort of thing when I'm sitting or standing. There is no body.\nCan you tell me how mango juice tastes? I can't. You also cannot; but you try to relive the memory of mango\njuice now -- you create for yourself some kind of an experience of how it tastes -- which I cannot do. I must\nhave mango juice on my tongue -- seeing or smelling it is not enough -- in order to be able to bring that\npast knowledge into operation and to say \"Yes, this is what mango juice tastes like.\" This does not mean\nthat personal preferences and 'tastes' change. In a market my hand automatically reaches out for the same\nitems that I have liked all my life. But because I cannot conjure up a mental experience, there can be no\ncraving for foods which are not there.\nSmell plays a greater part in your daily life than does taste. The olfactory organs are constantly open to\nodors. But if you do not interfere with the sense of smell, what is there is only an irritation in the nose. It\nmakes no difference whether you are smelling cow dung or an expensive French perfume -- you rub the\nnose and move on.” - U.G. Krishnamurti, The Mystique of Enlightenment\n“Hi Star,\nYou have loosen the ‘bond’ of a background, no-self is experienced; but the propensity of ‘attempting to\nunderstand through seeing things as object and subject’ is still there. “What it means, what it is, how do we\nmake sense of it’ is a struggle. It is a struggle of the dualistic mind attempting to understand something\nfrom measurement and comparisons. This propensity must also be deconstructed until you are so\ncomfortable of being naked in awareness. This mode of gaining knowledge from deduction, induction,\nmeasurement and comparison is ‘learnt’, it is not the natural state of awareness. There must be a clear\nunderstanding that the depth of spirituality cannot be known through such mode of ‘understanding’. This\nis also a 'seed' that creates the ‘sense of self’. A unit of experience is ‘blocked’ by all these propensities that\nwe are unable to intuitively know the unborn nature of awareness. It is not a 'mind trick' as what some said\nalthough wisdom practitioners do not talk about non-local issues.\nConventionally, to experience non-local aspect of pristine awareness is through concentration. It is the job\nof concentration. Concentration till one enters into a deep stage of absorption and object-subject becomes\none, a state of transcendence. Non-local experiences in such a practice are reached through the power of\n‘focus’. So the key towards non-local experiences is absorption and transcendence.\nNon-duality on the other hand is a form of realization, a realization that all along there never was a split.\nIts clarity and level of transcendence come from dissolving the ‘seeds’ that prevents the ‘seeing’. Very\nseldom we hear people talk about the non-local aspect in the practice of wisdom but non-duality do meet\n633\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nnon-locality at the point of transcendence (phase 4). It is some sort of absorption as in the case of\nconcentration but it is more of 'clarity till the point of absorption'. It may sound paradoxical, but this is true.\nThis is the way of wisdom.\nThere are many layers of consciousness and the truth of non-duality must first sink deep down into the\ninmost consciousness. It is important to reach the phase of ‘turning point’ as at this phase, the realization\nof no-self has sunk sufficiently deep into consciousnesses till there is no retreat. Otherwise that joy and\nexperience of no-self will be lost in a few months time (This is my experience) and resurface again until\n\"Emptiness as forms' is deeply experienced. In phase 2-3, non-local experiences may be experienced for\nsome people and mostly with the help of concentration (like asking a question of our past lives) it can be\nexperienced after 6-9 months of practices especially after deeply experiencing ‘Emptiness is Form’. Non-\nlocal aspect is triggered at the point of transcendence.\nBelow is some sort of summary of what I think an insight practitioner will go through. What I outline is far\nfrom being authoritative, it is just for communicating and sharing purposes. :)\n1. Perception still lingers but there is a clear understanding that there is no-self apart from manifestation.\nPractice clarity from insight meditation will help. Clarity from all 6 doors – eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body,\nconsciousness.\n2. Perception is dropped. Mind/body dropped. A very important phase. ‘Body’ is but a ‘mental construct’.\nWhen that ‘imprints’ and ‘meanings’ of ‘body’ is dropped, division between inner and outer is gone. All\ndivisions of senses are also gone. All is One Taste. Just Isness. Manifold of presence experienced clearly.\n3. Emptiness as Forms and Spontaneous manifestation.\nSubmerge oneself into spontaneous manifestation yet there is crystal clarity of the texture and fabric of\nawareness as ‘forms’. Dualistic cognition is replaced by directness, naturalness and spontaneity.\nSpontaneity, naturalness and flow took over all dualistic perceptions. Conscious, sub-consciousness and\nunconsciousness function as a whole without division. There is no need to hold on to a conscious knowing;\nthere is no need to understanding anything. Whether one understands is no more important, all\nknowingness comes from flow of wholeness. There is no attempt to deviate from what is as a whole. Here,\nthere is a danger of skewing towards spontaneity. Not to miss out the luminosity aspect, Emptiness as\nForms. These 2 aspects must is one. Luminosity is conscious level and spontaneity is unconscious level, the\n2 as one. :) True spontaneity is in luminosity. Psychological death is overcome. Turning point.\n4. Only one tremendous spontaneous clarity flows, there is no differentiation between what that spins the\nearth or what that pumps your heart beats or what that makes the plants grow. When you eat an apple, it\nis the entire universe that eats the apple. Just one whole clarity spontaneity flow. Continual experience of\ntranscendence joy and bliss.\n634\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nHow the 'seeds' bond us is amazing… Ultimately nothing gained! :)\nGood Luck!” - John Tan, 2007\n“Now the idea that there is a bordering line between an internal aspect of the body and an external aspect\napart from the body has to be taken into account as well. This 'bordering line' creating the dichotomy of\ninternal/external is based on identification with 'the body'. But the body itself is not separate from vision\neither, there are other colors and shades which are identified as 'my body' but just like the colors which\ncomposed the salt, these colors appearing as a 'body' do not communicate a possessive nature. The colors\nsimply arise no different than any other color in the field of vision. We only impute a notion of 'my body'\nover these colors. There are other faculties that seem to correlate with vision to give the appearance of a\nhomogeneous cluster of sensations conventionally called the body and we can discuss those separately,\nbut all are merely qualities appearing to awareness as awareness itself. So the notion of an 'subject inside'\nviewing an 'object outside' is not self-evident in vision. Vision simply appears and is completely non-\ndiscriminative. Another thing which isn't self-evident in vision is the presence of 'eyes' doing the seeing, we\nnever experience or see our own eyes at any time, even in the act of looking at a mirror we only are ever\nseeing colors and shapes arise that we identify with as 'me' and 'my eyes' but the eyes appear nowhere\nwithin vision itself, we again only accept a story about this.” - Kyle Dixon, 2012, in a must-read article A Sun\nThat Never Sets\n“Bringing awareness to present moment sensory experiencing, to the actuality of the body, erases the body\nand the self completely, meaning that it erases the mirage of separate and enduring things and the\nimaginary boundaries between them, and it leaves only this seamless and all-inclusive boundlessness. Of\ncourse, we still have a functional sense of boundaries and of our body--that doesn't vanish into some\nformless mush. But on close investigation, we find that the boundaries and the forms don't really exist in\nthe way we think they do.\nThe real body (no body at all) is not a cadaver or an anatomy book picture. It is alive and fluid and moving.\nExperientially, it is nothing but ever-changing sensations showing up in this vast awaring presence that\nincludes the whole universe. And in fact, \"the body\" is an ever-moving process of blood circulating, cells\ndividing, nerves firing, heart beating, lungs expanding and contracting, food being taken in, broken down,\ndisbursed or eliminated. The body is in constant exchange with the environment. The skin is porous and\nbreathing, flaking off, regenerating. The breath is coming in and going out. Your body now is not the same\nbody you had ten years ago, or ten days ago, or even back when you started reading this paragraph less\nthan a minute ago. Everything has changed since then -- your hormones, your neurochemistry -- the whole\nuniverse has moved. Life is nothing but ceaseless change.” - Joan Tollifson, “Body / No-Body”\nhttps://www.joantollifson.com/writing7.html\nIn 2010, Thusness wrote:\n635\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“(10:54 PM) Thusness: when joan tollifson say there is \"no body, only sensations\", she understands\nclearly the power of the 'word' body. How it 'blinds' the mind. she does not mean that 'body' does not exist\nconventionally. Similarly, when a practitioner speaks of non-dual, he penetrates and seen through the\nillusion of 'division'. this is different from just mere non-dual experience. but both are of different\nexperiences and realization -- \"division\" and \"no body\". sames applies to \"coming and going\" . it does not\nmean that once you experienced non-dual, you will penetrate the meaning of \"no coming or going\"\n(11:00 PM) AEN: rupert spira said \"The idea that there is a mind which contains memories, hopes, fears\nand desires is itself simply a thought that appears from time to time like any other thought, in\nConsciousness. There is no mind as such. The existence of a mind is simply an idea, a concept. It is a useful\nconcept but it is not a fact of experience. Likewise, we do not experience the body in the way we normally\nconceive it. In fact there is no body as such. There is a series of sensations and perceptions appearing in\nConsciousness. And from time to time, there is a thought or an image of a 'body,' which is considered to be\nthe sum total of all these sensations and perceptions. However, this thought or image appears in\nConsciousness in exactly the same way as the sensations and perceptions to which it apparently refers.\nAnd this apparent body is made of the same substance as a thought. It is made of mind, taking mind in the\nbroadest sense of the term, to include sensing and perceiving as well as thinking. If we stick closely to the\nactual experience of our bodily sensations, shapeless and contourless. We may experience a visual\nperception of the skin and from several different perceptions conceive a well-defined border which\ncontains all other bodily sensations. However, this conception does not describe the Reality of our\nexperience. The visual perception of the surface of the body is one perception. A bodily sensation is another\nperception. When one of these perceptions is present the other is not. If they are both present, they are\none perception, one experience. One perception cannot appear within another. All perceptions appear\nwithin Consciousness. We do not experience a sensation inside the body. What we call the body is in fact\nthe experience of a sensation. We do not experience a sensation within a well defined contour of skin. We\nexperience a sensation within Consciousness and we experience a visual perception within consciousness.\nWe can explore this further by imagining what it would be like to draw our actual experience of the body\nat any given moment, on a piece of paper. Would it look anything like the body we normally conceive?\nWould it not be a collection of minute, amorphous abstract marks, floating on the page, without a shape or\na border? Is not the actual experience of the body a collection of minute, amorphous, tingling sensations\nfree-floating in the space of Consciousness? And if we look at these sensations, are they not permeated\nand saturated with the presence of Consciousness in which they appear? The continuity and coherence\nthat we normally ascribe to the body in fact belong to Consciousness. In fact our true body is Consciousness.\nIt is Consciousness that houses all sensations that we normally refer to as the body. Our true body is open,\ntransparent, weightless and limitless. It is inherently empty and yet contains all things within itself. That is\nwhy such an empty body is also inherently loving. It is the welcoming embrace of all things.\"\n(11:05 PM) Thusness: a person that experiences this also experiences mind/body drop. however,\nthat is One Mind.\n(11:06 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:06 PM) Thusness: only when you get to there, then we discuss further.\n(11:07 PM) Thusness: i wrote that in one of dharma dan forum too.\nabout awareness and sensations\n636\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(11:07 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:07 PM) Thusness: hmm...which one\nto gary?\n(11:07 PM) AEN: hmm.. cant remember\nbut familiar\n(11:08 PM) AEN: to gozen?\n(11:08 PM) AEN: oh ya\nto gary\nhttps://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdharmaoverground.wetpaint.com%2\nFthread%2F2657969%2FThe%2Bmind%2Band%2Bthe%2Bwatcher&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7Cac01761\n05b07438c720208d93abc4679%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C63760540257630\n5987%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6\nMn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=brSQWCeZr%2FvY4f6kZlZfKYtKahy4fkl5zLDeVE11l9U%3D&amp;reserved=\n0\n(11:09 PM) Thusness: not in our blog?\ncannot get in...forgot the password\n(11:10 PM) AEN: Gary: | Post edited: Apr 6 2009, 9:10 AM EDT\n\"In walking meditation the \"I\" appears to place or make sense of the sensory perception. This involves a\nbody image for example foot sensations are perceived to be at the foot, movement is perceived in\nrelation to the previous position. Once in walking meditation I had the body disappear so there was just\nthe feet touch sensations belonging and going nowhere. Does this describe direct without intermediary?\n\"\nYes Gary, what you said is correct. It is only a matter of depth and intensity, ie, how clear, how vivid, how\nreal, how pristine the arising and passing sensations are when compared to the “I AM”. In the case of “I\nAM”, it is so clear, so real and so pristine that it burns away all traces of doubts. Absolutely certain, still\nand thoughtless that even Buddha is unable to shake the practitioner from this direct Realization of “I-\nness”.\nBy the way, there should not be any ‘image’ in whatever experienced, thus, direct.\nWith regards to the “body's disappearance” that you mentioned, it relates to an experience called the\n“mind-body drop”. There are few more important points that you may want to take note:\n1. It is not just due to “concentration on the sensations, the body image had no opportunity to arise”, the\ninsight that mind and body are mere constructs must also arise and the disappearance is also the result\nof dissolving of these constructs.\n2. Mind-body drop must also come with a sense of lightness. In the first few glimpses, you will also feel\nweightless and when the experience becomes clearer, you will also realize the “weight” of these\nconstructs.\n3. From the constructs, you may also want to explore further what happen when the constructs of\n“in/out” disappears.\nLastly the practice of self enquiry is not without danger. A practitioner can also be led into a state of utter\nconfusions when exploring the ‘I’ through mere analytical process. So practice with care.\n637\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(11:11 PM) Thusness: not just that\nanother one about awareness and sensations\n(11:12 PM) Thusness: but what rupert said is exactly what i want to convey to gary\n(11:12 PM) AEN: oic.. in the post on awareness and sensations?\n(11:13 PM) AEN: or the post above\n(11:15 PM) Thusness: i said if we truly and directly experience sensations as it is, then we will realize\nsensations share similar nature as awareness, they share the same taste\n(11:17 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:24 PM) Thusness: If we ask “Who am I”, does the question already condition the experience\nfrom beginning?

This leads to dissolving even the grounding\ninto ‘Here/Now’, which will be an issue if one focuses solely on the second stanza of anatta (like many Actual\nFreedom and Zen teachings that I’ve seen which keeps emphasizing on being grounded in Here/Now).\nOn the dispersing of Presence as multiplicity:\n“In many of your recent posts after the sudden realization of anatta from contemplating on Bahiya Sutta,\nyou are still very much focused on the vivid non-dual presence. Now the everything feels ‘Me’ sort of\n639\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nsensation becomes a daily matter and the bliss of losing oneself completely into scenery, sound, taste is\nwonderful. This is different from everything collapsing into a “Single Oneness” sort of experience but a\ndisperse out into the multiplicity of whatever arises. Everything feels closer than ‘me’ due to gaplessness.\nThis is a natural [state after anatta]” - John Tan, 2011\n“It looks your Bahiya Sutta experience helped you see awareness in a different way, more .... empty. You\nhad a background in a view that saw awareness as more inherent or essential or substantive?\nI had an experience like this too. I was reading a sloka in Nagarjuna's treatise about the \"prior entity,\" and\nI had been meditating on \"emptiness is form\" intensely for a year. These two threads came together in a\nbig flash. In a flash, I grokked the emptiness of awareness as per Madhyamika. This realization is quite\ndifferent from the Advaitic oneness-style realization. It carries one out to the \"ten-thousand things\" in a\nwonderful, light and free and kaleidoscopic, playful insubstantial clarity and immediacy. No veils, no\nholding back. No substance or essence anywhere, but love and directness and intimacy everywhere...” -\nGreg Goode, Greg Goode on Advaita/Madhyamika (https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2014/08/greg-\ngoode-on-advaitamadhyamika_9.html)\n“Although Bhāviveka doesn’t struggle that much, he is quite clear:\n“Since [the tīrthika position of] self, permanence, all pervasiveness and oneness contradict their opposite,\n[the Buddhist position of] no-self, impermanence, non-pervasiveness and multiplicity, they are completely\ndifferent.” – Kyle Dixon, 2020\n“Bhāviveka demonstrates the proper way to view buddhanature:\nThe statement \"The tathāgata pervades\" means wisdom pervades all objects of knowledge, but it does not mean\nabiding in everything like Viśnu. Further, \"Tathāgatagarbhin\" means emptiness, signlessness and absence of\naspiration exist the continuums of all sentient beings, but is not an inner personal agent pervading everyone.” –\nKyle Dixon, 2021\n\"Therefore to see that all dusts are primordially pure from before beginning is the whole purpose of\nmaturing the insight of anatta. The following text succinctly expresses this insight:\n...According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not contain the myriad forms, nor is it made up of myriad forms\n– it is the myriad forms themselves. The same instruction is provided at the beginning of Shobogenzo, Gabyo\n(pictured rice-cakes) where, he asserts that, “as all Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho), so too, “all\ndharmas are enlightenment” which he says does not mean they are simply “one” nature or mind.\nAnything falling short of this realization cannot be said to be Buddhist's enlightenment and it is also what\nyour Taiwanese teacher Chen wanted you to be clear when he spoke of the \"equality of dharma\" as having\nan initial glimpse of anatta will not result in practitioners seeing that phenomena are themselves\nprimordially pure.\" - John Tan, 2011, Realization, Experience and Right View and my comments on \"A\" is\n\"not-A\", \"not A\" is \"A\"\n640\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“All Buddhas and all things cannot be reduced to a static entity or principle symbolized as one mind, one\nnature, or the like. This guards against views that devaluate the unique, irreplaceable individuality of a\nsingle dharma.” - Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.257\n“Gensha Shibi once said, “The whole universe throughout all its ten directions is the One Bright Pearl.”\nYou need to clearly recognize the converse, which is that the One Bright Pearl is the whole universe\nthroughout all its ten directions.”\n- Zen Master Dogen,\nhttps://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/058jippo.pdf\nMahamudra has a similar teaching as Dogen on 'multiplicity':\n\"The medium One Taste is when this tarnish has dissolved: the conviction of savoring and clinging to\nmultiplicity as being one taste. You have actualized the resplendent indivisibility of perceptions and mind\nin which the perceived is not held as being outside and mind is not held as being inside.\nThe greater One Taste is when you realize multiplicity as being of one taste and you experience one taste\nas being multiplicity. Thus, everything subsides into the original state of equality.\"\n\"You have perfected the strength of One Taste if whatever you encounter is experienced as the expression\nof this original state of equality. You have not perfected its strength if one taste isn't experienced as\nmultiplicity because of retaining the bind of a remedy.\" - Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, Clarifying the Natural State\nJohn Tan and Soh very much likes and resonates with the teachings of Mahamudra and Soto Zen (Dogen’s\nlineage) very much as they are about the full-blown actualization of anatta, with different emphasis on\nemptiness (Soto Zen emphasizing +A, Mahamudra emphasizing the -A in general). If you resonate with the\nteachings, Soh highly recommends finding a good teacher, guru or sangha to get acquainted with/receive\nteachings from the lineage and participate in communal practice.\nOn “multiplicity”, post-anatta when one penetrates into emptiness, there is no one or many:\n“[13/3/16, 2:15:15 PM] John Tan: When the \"one\" dissolves, so too must the \"many\". How is it that the \"one\"\nor \"many\" can dissolve? Because both are unreal and purely conventional. If either are real, then changing\nand dissolving will be impossible.”\nAlthough I might also add, eventually presence as a unifying field from which all arise is also seen through.\nSomething Soh wrote before:\n641\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“\"Awareness when reified becomes a whole containing everything as its parts, like the ocean and its waves.\nBut when you deconstruct the wave and ocean, the whole and parts, it is just the radiance and clarity of\npellucidity of sound, taste, colors of the imputed notion of wave and ocean. Ocean and waves, whole and\nparts, are mere dependent designations, merely conventional without any self-essence/inherent existence.\nAwareness is a name just like weather is a name denoting rain, wind, sunshine, etc., and not a container or\nsingular substance pervading them or transforming or modulating as them. Likewise, awareness is not an\neternal singular substance pervading or containing or even modulating as everything. What is seen, heard,\nsensed are clear and vivid, pellucid and crystal, and 'awareness' is just a name denoting just that, not a\ndiverse manifestation pervaded by a single ontological awareness that is non-dual with everything.\nEventually, awareness is seen through as having its own reality and forgotten into the pellucidity of\nappearance, not just a state but an insight. As Scott Kiloby once said, 'If you see that awareness is none\nother than everything, and that none of those things are separate \"things\" at all, why even use the word\nawareness anymore? All you are left with is the world, your life, the diversity of experience itself.' Another\nteacher, Dr. Greg Goode, told me, 'It looks like your Bahiya Sutta experience helped you see awareness in\na different way, more... empty. You had a background in a view that saw awareness as more inherent or\nessential or substantive?'\nI had an experience like this too.

Then\nwhen background consciousness is gone and only empty appearances left, even \"wave\" is gone.\nMany got stuck at One-Mind, there are also many that got stuck in non-conceptualities also in de-\nconstruction and do know know the actual taste of empty radiance.\n[1/8/23, 12:08:49 PM] John Tan: Everything is of \"nature\" of space in contrast to everything dissolves into\nspace and space becomes a special substratum.\n642\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAlso,\nTed Biringer commenting on Zen Master Dogen: “...According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not\ncontain the myriad forms, nor is it made up of myriad forms – it is the myriad forms themselves. The same\ninstruction is provided at the beginning of Shobogenzo, Gabyo (pictured rice-cakes) where, he asserts that,\n“as all Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho), so too, “all dharmas are enlightenment” which he says\ndoes not mean they are simply “one” nature or mind.”\n…\n“In Dogen’s view, the only reality is reality that is actually experienced as particular things at specific times.\nThere is no “tile nature” apart from actual “tile forms,” there is no “essential Baso” apart from actual\ninstances of “Baso experience.” When Baso sits in zazen, “zazen” becomes zazen, and “Baso” becomes Baso.\nReal instances of Baso sitting in zazen is real instances of Baso and real instances of zazen – when Baso\neats rice, Baso is really Baso and eating rice is really eating rice.” - Ted Biringer,\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2017/11/zazen-polishing-tile-to-make-mirror.html\n….\nQuotes from The Great Ocean Samadhi chapter from Zen Master Dogen's Shobogenzo:\nThe Buddha once said in verse:\nMerely of various elements is this body of Mine composed.\nThe time of its arising is merely an arising of elements;\nThe time of its vanishing is merely a vanishing of elements.\nAs these elements arise, I do not speak of the arising of an ‘I’,\nAnd as these elements vanish, I do not speak of the vanishing of an ‘I’.\nPrevious instants and succeeding instants are not a series of instants that depend on each other;\nPrevious elements and succeeding elements are not a series of elements that stand against each other.\nTo give all of this a name, I call it ‘the meditative state that bears the seal of the Ocean’.\n....\nThe Master’s saying, “One that contains all that exists,” expresses what the Ocean is. The point he is making\nis not that there is some single thing that contains all that exists, but rather that It is all contained things.\nAnd he is not saying that the Great Ocean is what contains all existing things, but rather that what is\nexpressing ‘all contained things’ is simply the Great Ocean. Though we do not know what It is, It is everything\nthat exists for the moment. Even coming face-to-face with a Buddha or an Ancestor is a mistaken perception\nof ‘everything that exists for the moment’. At the moment of ‘being contained’, although it may involve a\nmountain, it is not just our ‘standing atop a soaring mountain peak’, and although it may involve water, it is\nnot just our ‘plunging down to the floor of the Ocean’s abyss’.18 Our acts of acceptance will be like this, as\n643\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nwill our acts of letting go.

Without the 'I' that links, phenomena\n(thoughts, sound, feelings and so on and so forth) appear bubble-like, floating and manifesting freely,\nspontaneously and boundlessly. With the absence of the doer-ship also comes a deep sense of freedom\nand transparency. Ironical as it may sound but it's true experientially. We will not have the right\nunderstanding when we hold too tightly 'inherent' view. It is amazing how 'inherent' view prevents us from\nseeing freedom as no-doership, interdependence and interconnectedness, luminosity and non-dual\npresence.” - John Tan, 2011\n“In the beginning... when I had the sudden realization by contemplating on Bahiya Sutta, there was a very\nclear realization of 'in the seeing just the seen' - the second stanza of Anatta in John's article... seeing,\nhearing, is simply the scenery, the sound, it is so clear, vivid, without dualistic separation (of subject and\nobject, perceived and perceived)... there never was, there is only the music playing and revealing itself. The\nscenery revealing itself...\nIt is very blissful, the luminosity is very clear and intensely felt. Yet it became a sort of object of attachment...\nsomehow, even though luminosity is no longer seen as a Self or observer, there is still a sense of solidity\nthat luminosity/presence is constantly Here and Now. A subtle tendency to sink back into substantialist\nnon-dualism is still present.\nLater on, I came to realize that luminosity, presence itself, is ungraspable without solidity. Much like the\nfirst stanza of Anatta in John’ article. There is no luminosity inherently existing as the 'here and now'...\npresence cannot be found, located, grasped! There is nothing solid here. There is no 'here and now' - as\nDiamond Sutra says, past mind is ungraspable, present mind is ungraspable, future mind is ungraspable.\nWhat there is, is unsupported, disjoint thoughts and phenomena... There is only the ungraspable\nexperiencing of everything, which is bubble like. Everything just pops in and out. It's like a stream... cannot\nbe grasped or pinned down... like a dream, yet totally vivid. Cannot be located as here or there.\nPrior to this insight, there isn't the insight into phenomena as being 'scattered' without a linking basis (well\nthere already was but it needs refinement)... the moment you say there is a Mind, an Awareness, a Presence\n644\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nthat is constant throughout all experiences, that pervades and arise as all appearances, you have failed to\nsee the 'no-linking', 'disjointed', 'unsupported' nature of manifestation.\nThe luminosity and the emptiness are inseparable. They are both essential aspects of our experiential\nreality and must be seen in its seamlessness and unity. Realizing this, there is just disjoint thoughts and\nphenomena arising without support and liberating of their own accord. There is nothing solid acting as the\nbasis of these experiences and linking them... there is just spontaneous and unsupported manifestations\nand self liberating experiences. Simpo_ described it well recently:\nWill like to add that, in my experience, no-self is a more subtle insight than non-duality.\nUsually, we see a continuity of mental formation... well... my experience is that it is not always so. The streams of\nthought seems to be linear but it is not.. To my experience, it is the fast movement of thoughts that give the\nimpression of continuity of self.\nNow... thoughts can appear and disappear and they do not have to be linear... 'Simpo' the name pop up and\ndisappear... another image appears and disappears... all of them are not self... just appearance, sensations, etc...\nand we cannot say they arise from a base or sink into the base. There is no base (as far as I see it)... just this\nungraspable appearing and disappearing.\nWithout this realization, one can never hope to understand this phrase in Diamond Sutra:\nTherefore then, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being, should produce an unsupported thought, i.e. a thought\nwhich is nowhere supported, a thought unsupported by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables or mind-objects.\n应无所住而生其心\nThis is the phrase that got 6th Ch'an Patriarch Hui-Neng his great enlightenment after the 5th Patriarch\nexplained it to him.” - Soh, 2011\n“...Just as Zen Master Dogen puts it: firewood does not turn into ashes, firewood abides in the phenomenal\nexpression of firewood while ash abides in the phenomenal expression of ash, while at the same time ash\ncontains firewood, firewood contains ash (all is the manifestation of the interdependent universe as if the\nentire universe is coming together to give rise to this experience and thus all is contained in one single\nexpression).\nThe similar principle applies not just to firewood and ash but to everything else: for example you do not\nsay summer turns into autumn and autumn turns into winter - summer is summer, autumn is autumn,\ndistinct and complete in itself yet each instance of existence time contains the past, present and future in\nit. So the same applies to birth and death - birth does not turn into death as birth is the phenomenal\nexpression of birth and death is the phenomenal expression of death - they are interdependent yet disjoint,\nunsupported, complete. Accordingly, birth is no-birth and death is no-death... Since each moment is not\nreally a starting point or ending point for a entity - without the illusion and reference of a self-entity - every\nmoment is simply a complete manifestation of itself. And every manifestation does not leave traces: they\nare disjoint, unsupported and self-releases upon inception. This wasn't Dogen's exact words but I think the\n645\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ngist is there, you should read Dogen's genjokoan which I posted in my blog.” - Soh, 2011, The Unborn\nDharma - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2011/06/the-unborn-dharma.html\n“A thought is \"Unsupported\" because it does not arise in dependence upon anything else, not \"caused\" by\nanother thought (\"mind-objects\") and of course not \"produced\" by a thinker, which the Bodhisattva realizes\ndoes, not exist. Such an \"unsupported thought\", then, is prajña, arising by itself nondually.\nHui Neng's grandson in the Dharma, Ma-tsu, reinforces Hui Neng and the Diamond Sutra: \"So with former\nthoughts, later thoughts, and thoughts in between: the thoughts follow one another without being linked\ntogether. Each one is absolutely tranquil\". [24] That each such \"unsupported thought\" is absolutely tranquil\nis a new point, although probably implied by Hui Neng's term \"thoughtlessness\". So when one loses sense\nof self and completely becomes an unsupported thought, there is the Taoist paradox of wei-wu-wei, in\nwhich action and passivity are combined: there is the movement of nondual thought, but at the same time\nthere is awareness of that which does not change. That is why such an experience can just as well be\ndescribed as \"thoughtlessness\". The later Ch'an master Kuei-shan Ling-yu referred to this as \"thoughtless\nthought\": \"Through concentration a devotee may gain thoughtless thought. Thereby he is suddenly\nenlightened and realizes his original nature\". [25] \"Thoughtless thought\" is not a mind empty of any thought:\n\"one thought is thoughtless thought.\"\nAn important parallel to this is found in the writings of a modern Advaitin, Ramana Maharshi:\nThe ego in its purity is experienced in the interval between two states or between two thoughts. The ego is\nlike the worm which leaves one hold only after it catches another. Its true nature is known when it is out of\ncontact with objects or thoughts. You should realize this interval as the abiding, unchangeable Reality, your\ntrue Being... [26]\nThe image of the ego as a worm which leaves one hold only after catching another might well have been\nused by Hui Neng and Ma-tsu to describe the way in which thoughts are apparently linked up in a series.\nThe difference is that Mahayana Buddhism encourages the arising of \"an unsupported thought\", whereas\nRamana Maharshi understands unchangeable Reality as that which is realized only when it is out of contact\nwith all objects and thoughts. This is consistent with the general relation between Mahayana and Advaita:\nNirguṇa Brahman is so emptied of any attribute (\"neti, neti,...\") that it becomes impossible to differentiate\nfrom Śūnyatā. \"It is difficult indeed to distinguish between pure being and pure non-being as a category\".\n(S. Dasgupta). [27] But there is still a difference in emphasis.\nMahāyāna emphasizes realizing the emptiness of all phenomena, whereas Advaita distinguishes between\nempty Reality and phenomena, with the effect of devaluing the latter into mere māyā.\nThe image of a worm hesitant to leave its hold was used in a personal conversation I had in 1981\nwith a Theravada monk from Thailand, a meditation master named Phra Khemananda. This was before I\ndiscovered the passage from Ramana Maharshi; what Khemananda said was not prompted by any remark\nof mine, but was taught to him by his own teacher in Thailand. He began by drawing the following diagram:\n646\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nEach oval represents a thought, he said; normally, we leave one thought only when we have another one\nto go to (as the arrows indicate), but to think in this way constitutes ignorance. Instead, we should realize\nthat thinking is actually like this:\nThen we will understand the true nature of thoughts: that thoughts do not arise from each other but by\nthemselves.” ~ Zen teacher David Loy, Nondual Thinking\nAn article on anatta from the monk who drew the diagram can be found here.\nAlso, some recent writing by Daniel on Vipassana in DhO:\nhttps://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/11355316\n“JC said \"why the need to experiment with all sorts of practices? Why the need for the switch to Zen, Vajrayana,\nprayer, Catholic devotional practices, martial arts, magickal practices, and so on?\nWhy not just continue to observe exactly what's going on in the present moment and see the Three Characteristics?\nWell, it could be enough, sort of. The Three Characteristics are profound, very profound, staggeringly\nprofound, and not easily grasped in their entirety. It seems perfectly reasonable to grasp them in their\nentirety by observing them, but there is a problem, actually, that last line contains a bunch of problems that\nare not obvious until you see them clearly.\nI will go by the words in that last line to illustrate the problem.\n\"Continue\": there is no continuing. There is nothing to continue, no past that could be continued, no future\nto continue into, and this moment is entirely ungraspable. No sensation could ever actually grasp or\ncontinue. Everything is fresh but perfectly ephemeral. The notion of continuing, from a high insight point\nof view, is a serious problem. Instead, there has to be a deep non-grasping, a perfect and flawless\nappreciation of non-continuing, a deep never could be a continuing, a deep nothing could ever be\ncontinuing, a deep sense of not only discontinuity, but of the utter flowing, vanishing, empty transience of\nanything that seemed to be able to continue. One must figure out how to go beyond continuing, beyond\ngrasping, beyond that strange mental illusion that such a thing could ever occur or have occurred.\n647\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"Observe\": there is no observing. There can be no observing. There is nothing that can observe at all.\nEverything is just occurring where it is, naturally, straightforwardly. There is no observer. There can't be any\nobserver. There never was any observer. Deeply understanding this is required. There never was any\nobservation. Observation can't finally do it. One must figure out how to shift out of observing to just\nphenomena occurring.\nThe qualifier \"in the present moment\" is a problem in some way. This almost always involves some subtle\nor gross pattern of sensations that we refer to mentally when we say \"now\", or \"the present\", which are not\nactually stable, not actually a present, not actually anything but more empty transience, yet we make them\nseem like a stable present. This is very subtle, deep, profound. Even \"the present\" doesn't withstand\nscrutiny, and we must be careful with this sticky concept, as it can itself become a sort of a solidified thing,\npart of the illusion of continuity, observation, practitioner, etc.\nSo, while it is true that deeply comprehending emptiness, non-continuity, non-observation, and even non-\npresent, can occur by just continuously observing this present moment, we must be careful, and sometimes\nit takes people shifting out of their trench of \"good practice\" to do something that is out from good practice\nand instead is just the unfolding empty wisdom dharma. Various people find various methods to make this\nsubtle shift, and one size definitely does not fit all, so best wishes sorting out what will help you work out\nyour salvation with diligence.\nDaniel\nOne could just say that each transient moment, however it is, naturally understands its ungraspable,\ndiscontinuous, ephemeral, non-existent, empty nature, straightforwardly, perfectly.\nHowever, one must be careful not to idealize or intellectually reify any of those concepts and qualifiers, and\ninstead this is something that is purely perceptual.\nIt applies to every transient moment, regardless of any other consideration of the specific qualities of that\nmoment.\nAll that said, I did, as my last push, go back to the Three Characteristics and Six Sense Doors, just those, but\nat a level of extremely high precision, inclusiveness, and acceptance, and found that effective. Yet, the place\nI had gotten to that seemed to make it effective was a radical disenchantment and dispassion towards with\neverything “I” had attained, everything “I” was, everything “I” could become, everything “I” could experience,\nand how to arrive at such a place varies a lot by the person.” - Daniel M. Ingram\nJohn Tan wrote to me after my deepening insight into the first stanza of anatta that dissolved the grounding\ninto here/now, about 5 months after the initial insight into anatta.\n648\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“John: it is insight into anatta and DO then you lose all dualistic and inherent view and what's left is simply\ndharma… I do not want you to fall back to Awareness. when you do not experience 'disjoint and\nunsupported' with clarity, you will fall back. when you are able to mature the disjoint and unsupported\nexperience then there is no holding to Awareness… it is just a word. what is actual is just simply this\nluminous activity or ceaseless activity. so you know what I meant about AF (Actual Freedom) not talking\nabout liberation last time?\nit is more on stanza 2. direct apprehension… flesh and blood of this body… all these are trying to get\ngrounded much like in the here and now. though tarin talk about that recently [Soh: letting go of the\ngrounding in Here/Now], I cannot see the clarity of insight. but I do not want you to go around making\nnoise...\nyou just have to 'taste' this directly and realize whether it is true or not. only when a practitioner mature\nthe 'disjoint' and 'unsupported' realization, the 'grounding' can then be gone. otherwise it is only 'talk'. :P\nso you must realize it, have a glimpse of this truth, then you know the 'how' of proceeding\nhow many months already after your insight of anatta?\nSoh: about 5” - Conversation with John Tan, 2011\n“(6:56 PM) Thusness: now experiencing no-mind as focus attention is different from experiencing no-mind\nin a disjoint and unsupported manner.\nwhat is the difference?\n(6:57 PM) AEN: as focus attention still has some level of effort because there is a need to sustain the\nground... no mind in a disjoint and unsupported manner is just constant opening and releasing without\neffort and without ground\n(7:00 PM) Thusness: well said...\nso what is the sensation like?\n(7:00 PM) AEN: disjoint and unsupported manner is like a sensation of not staying anywhere... ephemeral,\nbubble like phenomena arising and passing without traces\n(7:02 PM) Thusness: the key word is 'freedom'\nor liberating” - Conversation with John Tan, 2011\nContemplative Practices to Focus On After Anatta\nFirst give rise to anatta realization, afterwards, let it mature and stabilize in passive mode of no-self, then\nactualize anatta into the active mode (pure action) and then mature into total exertion. Then also, look into\ntwofold emptiness, and integrate the tastes of +A and -A. That's been my progression. First be thorough\nand without traces of self/Self or even subtle clinging to an ‘intrinsic clarity/Awareness’.\nJohn Tan wrote to me shortly after my anatta realization (he wrote this in Jan 2011): “AEN,\n649\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThe summary of the experiences and realizations that you have written for your teachers and masters are\ngood documentations of your journey but not to get too attached to external 'authentication'. :)\nWhat that is more important now is to realize after the arising insight of anatta, how through the adoption\nof 'right view' lead to thorough seamless and effortless experience of non-dual. As I have told you in the\nearlier post:\nThe initial break-through although may appear thorough to you but the clear experience of no-mind should\nnot last more than few months. It will lose its grandeur and the 'split' will surface intermittently.\nSo go through few cycles of refining your experience of no-mind and continue to adopt the 'right view' of\nunderstanding the experience. Have no doubt that Phenomena in their primordial purity is Dharmakaya.\nAlways check whether there is any lingering trace of a background. If there is, there will always be division.\nDo not fear challenging your imaginary split. In time to come, you will realize you can't re-experience the\n'division' even if you want to.\nOnce again, check and fearlessly challenge whether such lingering trace remains. Is non-dual intermitent\nor reversible and has the right view sunk into the deep most of your consciousness. This step must be\ndone with utmost sincerity and must not be compromised.\nThe grandeur will disappear after a few months but once the right view is practiced correctly, your\nexperience will be stable and continuous. There must be complete thoroughness and effortlessness in non-\ndual.\nThis is the only true authentication.”\nStabilizing passive mode of no-self:\n10/25/2012 10:33 AM: John: With regards to this innate clarity that is non-dual in nature, is there anything\nrequired for you to improve anything?\n10/25/2012 10:35 AM: Soh Wei Yu: No\n10/25/2012 10:36 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Trying to improve is like adding dirt to improve a jewel, lol\n10/25/2012 10:37 AM: John: Precisely, it is just relaxation into clarity...there is truly nothing that needs to\nbe done. That division is gone.\n10/25/2012 10:41 AM: John: What will be your natural progression next?\n10/25/2012 10:41 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Total exertion?\n10/25/2012 10:43 AM: John: No don't talk about that\n10/25/2012 10:43 AM: John: Look into your experience now\n10/25/2012 10:44 AM: Soh Wei Yu: To fully experience that clarity naturally?\n10/25/2012 10:49 AM: John: Yes and you must be very careful about that, to fully experience means?

Like you said, simply relax into experience as it is manifesting\n10/25/2012 10:56 AM: John: So there are few distinct phases, B4 and after the arising insight of anatta and\nwhen that insight of anatta becomes stable with almost no trace and gap left in passive mode of\nexperience in the six entries and exits.\n10/25/2012 10:56 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n10/25/2012 10:58 AM: John: Fully relax without holding anything, everything is in clearest expression.\n10/25/2012 10:59 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n10/25/2012 11:00 AM: John: And what does that mean?\n10/25/2012 11:02 AM: Soh Wei Yu: There is just the happening which is pure clarity, without any effort to\nabide, improve, etc\n10/25/2012 11:06 AM: Soh Wei Yu: When there is no self clinging, there is just the happening/clarity which\nis self-so, and the intensity of clarity reveals itself due to the absence of obscuration (clinging)\n10/25/2012 11:11 AM: John: Yes and what you call clarity is really just \"the everything in clearest\nexpression\" so forget about the clarity, it is the trick of language.\n10/25/2012 11:12 AM: John: So what does it mean by \"everything\"?\n10/25/2012 11:14 AM: John: Means it's no more looking at no-self or clarity but this so called\n\"everything\"...\n10/25/2012 11:24 AM: John: Btw, just tell James in his language, just be life and as life.\n10/25/2012 11:24 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Back\n10/25/2012 11:25 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Just post \"just be life and as life\"?\n10/25/2012 11:25 AM: John: In his language,\n10/25/2012 11:25 AM: Soh Wei Yu: Everything is like bahiya sutta, the six senses, manifestation, seen,\nheard, etc\n10/25/2012 11:25 AM: John: Coz you are not going to talk about Buddhism\n10/25/2012 11:26 AM: John: Yes...

I also like this one:\nNo Buddha is Conscious of its Existence [of having a Perfect-nature]\n\"By his fifteenth year one burning question became the core around which his spiritual strivings\nrevolved: \"If, as the sutras say, our Essential-nature is Bodhi (perfection), why did all Buddhas have\nto strive for enlightenment and perfection?\" His dissatisfaction with the answers he received at\nMount Hiei led him eventually to Eisai-zenji, who had brought the teachings of the Rinzai sect of\nZen Buddhism from China to Japan. Eisai's reply to Dogen's question was: \"No Buddha is conscious\nof its existence [that is, of this Essential-nature], while cats and oxen [that is the grossly deluded]\nare aware of it.\" In other words, Buddhas, precisely because they are Buddhas, no longer think of\nhaving or not having a Perfect-nature; only the deluded think in such terms. At these words Dogen\nhad an inner realization which dissolved his deep-seated doubt.\"\n658\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n-- recommended reading, Yasutani-roshi's Introductory Lectures on Zen Training (it's a practical\ntext on Zazen and Koan training)\n2\n· Reply\n· 21h\nSoh Wei Yu\nMy journal entry 25th February 2012\nI see Shikantaza (The Zen meditation method of “Just Sitting”) as the natural expression of\nrealization and enlightenment.\nBut many people completely misunderstand this... they think that practice-enlightenment means\nthere is no need for realization, since practicing is enlightenment. In other words, even a beginner\nis as realized as the Buddha when meditating.\nThis is plain wrong and thoughts of the foolish.\nRather, understand that practice-enlightenment is the natural expression of realization... and\nwithout realization, one will not discover the essence of practice-enlightenment.\nAs I told my friend/teacher 'Thusness', “I used to sit meditation with a goal and direction. Now,\nsitting itself is enlightenment. Sitting is just sitting. Sitting is just the activity of sitting, air con\nhumming, breathing. Walking itself is enlightenment. Practice is not done for enlightenment but all\nactivity is itself the perfect expression of enlightenment/buddha-nature. There is nowhere to go.\"\nI see no possibility of directly experiencing this unless one has clear direct non-dual insight.\nWithout realizing the primordial purity and spontaneous perfection of this instantaneous moment\nof manifestation as Buddha-nature itself, there will always be effort and attempt at 'doing', at\nachieving something... whether it be mundane states of calmness, absorption, or supramundane\nstates of awakening or liberation... all are just due to the ignorance of the true nature of this\ninstantaneous moment.\nHowever, non-dual experience can still be separated into:\n1) One Mind\n- lately I have been noticing that majority of spiritual teachers and masters describe non-dual in\nterms of One Mind. That is, having realized that there is no subject-object/perceiver-perceived\n659\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\ndivision or dichotomy, they subsume everything to be Mind only, mountains and rivers all are Me -\nthe one undivided essence appearing as the many.\nThough non-separate, the view is still of an inherent metaphysical essence. Hence non-dual but\ninherent.\n2) No Mind\nWhere even the 'One Naked Awareness' or 'One Mind' or a Source is totally forgotten and\ndissolved into simply scenery, sound, arising thoughts and passing scent. Only the flow of self-\nluminous transience.\n....\nHowever, we must understand that even having the experience of No Mind is not yet the\nrealization of Anatta. In the case of No Mind, it can remain a peak experience. In fact, it is a natural\nprogression for a practitioner at One Mind to occasionally enter into the territory of No Mind... but\nbecause there is no breakthrough in terms of view via realization, the latent tendency to sink back\ninto a Source, a One Mind is very strong and the experience of No Mind will not be sustained\nstably. The practitioner may then try his best to remain bare and non-conceptual and sustain the\nexperience of No Mind through being naked in awareness, but no breakthrough can come unless\na certain realization arises.\nIn particular, the important realization to breakthrough this view of inherent self is the realization\nthat Always Already, never was/is there a self - in seeing always only just the seen, the scenery,\nshapes and colours, never a seer! In hearing only the audible tones, no hearer! Just activities, no\nagent! A process of dependent origination itself rolls and knows... no self, agent, perceiver,\ncontroller therein.\nIt is this realization that breaks down the view of 'seer-seeing-seen', or 'One Naked Awareness'\npermanently by realizing that there never was a 'One Awareness' - 'awareness', 'seeing', 'hearing'\nare only labels for the everchanging sensations and sights and sounds, like the word 'weather'\ndon't point to an unchanging entity but the everchanging stream of rain, wind, clouds, forming and\nparting momentarily...\nThen as the investigation and insights deepen, it is seen and experienced that there is only this\nprocess of dependent origination, all the causes and conditions coming together in this\ninstantaneous moment of activity, such that when eating the apple it is like the universe eating the\napple, the universe typing this message, the universe hearing the sound... or the universe is the\nsound. Just that... is Shikantaza. In seeing only the seen, in sitting only the sitting, and the whole\nuniverse is sitting... and it couldn't be otherwise when there is no self, no meditator apart from\nmeditation. Every moment cannot 'help' but be practice-enlightenment... it is not even the result of\nconcentration or any form of contrived effort... rather it is the natural authentication of the\nrealization, experience and view in real-time.\nZen Master Dogen, the proponent of practice-enlightenment, is one of the rare and clear jewels of\nZen Buddhism who have very deep experiential clarity about anatta and dependent origination.\n660\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nWithout deep realization-experience of anatta and dependent origination in real time, we can\nnever understand what Dogen is pointing to... his words may sound cryptic, mystical, or poetic, but\nactually they are simply pointing to this.\nSomeone 'complained' that Shikantaza is just some temporary suppressing of defilements instead\nof the permanent removal of it. However if one realizes anatta then it is the permanent ending of\nself-view, i.e. traditional stream-entry.\n1\n· Reply\n· 21h\nJohn Tan\nSoh Wei Yu\ndin know you wrote this.

Don't get over\nexcited with your anatta insights and experiences. Don't become an anatta bot stereotyping and\ncategorizing people into the 7 phases of insights. I know you are extremely sincere and compassionate,\nbut it is unhelpful and unskillful in my opinion.\nI am not a teacher, neither are u. If you want to teach and guide, you should seriously consider taking up\nyour teacher's offer and start with Ren Cheng as she has been looking for successor since I know you\notherwise it is more appropriate to lead those sincere practitioners to right teachers. Unlike us, those\nteachers are dedicated full-time; have right settings and environment; have a community of sincere\npractitioners that mutually support each other; have all the right lineages; and have access to all the\nfrontier knowledge that are passed down from generation to generation from their lineage masters. Y not\njust do that?\nAs for those layman practitioners that for some reasons still prefer to go on their own asking for some\ngeneral guides post anatta insights, I think they can focus on the 5 following points:\n1. Extend the insight of anatta, the de-reification process to all events and phenomena. MMK comes\nhandy here. It will help one investigate most of the subtle assumptions we held to be \"true\" in a hypnotic\nway.\n2. Open up our body and go deeply into body-awareness. This is critical imo. Less intellectual activities\nand more body-awareness. Post anatta and along the path, due to the de-construction process, the\nenergy released from unconsciously holding of our mental constructs can be quite overwhelming. It may\nalso be due to other reasons, for example, attachment to non-dual experiences and as a result it will\nengender discomfort to both our mind and body.\n3. So opening up our body is key at this phase. The imbalance can be released by massage, non-\ninflammatory diet, qi gong, tai chi movements, yoga or any other body awareness exercises. Just open up\nour body and bring awareness to our body to complement the anatta insight and less intellectual\nactivities.\n4. If after that, the practitioner can intuit directly the relationship between mind, prana and body and wish\nto pursue his knowledge further on how the energy system works, they can then look for experienced\nteachers in this space to guide them. You are not into this, hence, do not advise people on what you are\nunsure and have no experience.\n5. Lastly, bring the insight of anatta into our daily activities, meet conditions and engage.\nI sincerely hope you can make some changes to your approach towards those that seek your advices. Do\nput serious thought on it.

Be not heedless!\nRegret not later! This is our instruction to you.”78” - Buddha in (Mūla) Samatha Vipassanā Sutta\n\"After this insight [of anatta], one must also be clear of the way of anatta and the path of practice. Many\nwrongly conclude that because there is no-self, there is nothing to do and nothing to practice. This is\nprecisely using \"self view\" to understand \"anatta\" despite having the insight.\nIt does not mean because there is no-self, there is nothing to practice; rather it is because there is no self,\nthere is only ignorance and the chain of afflicted activities. Practice therefore is about overcoming\nignorance and these chain of afflictive activities. There is no agent but there is attention. Therefore practice\nis about wisdom, vipassana, mindfulness and concentration. If there is no mastery over these practices,\nthere is no liberation. So one should not bullshit and psycho ourselves into the wrong path of no-practice\nand waste the invaluable insight of anatta. That said, there is the passive mode of practice of choiceless\nawareness, but one should not misunderstand it as the \"default way\" and such practice can hardly be\nconsidered \"mastery\" of anything, much less liberation.\" ~ John Tan\n“Anatta not only realizes the marvelous spontaneous functioning, anatta also clearly experience the\nafflictive chain being rolled out from ignorance to the formation of self. There is no self always, but there is\nthe afflictive sense of self formation from ignorance. The path is therefore the thorough exhaustion of\nignorance in the 3 states (waking, dreaming and sleeping)... … [There are] differences in degree of\novercoming [thoroughness of exhausting ignorance in the 3 states completely]” - John Tan, 2019\n673\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Now with your current insight and understanding, what should be the right approach to end this\nlingering sense of self? Your practice should be always realization, experience and views. Your experience\nmust refine [to be] like the place where there is no heat or cold*. Your anatta view must be extended to\nwhatever arises. Your realization must extend your anatta to dependent origination.” - John Tan, early\n2011\n*The Place Where There is No Heat or Cold: A monk asked Tozan, “When cold and heat come, how can we\navoid them?”\nTozan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nThe monk said, “What is the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nTozan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you; when it’s hot, the heat kills you.”\nThis is not advice to “accept” your situation, as some commentators have suggested, but a direct expression\nof authentic practice and enlightenment. Master Tozan is not saying, “When cold, shiver; when hot, sweat,”\nnor is he saying, “When cold, put on a sweater; when hot, use a fan.” In the state of authentic practice and\nenlightenment, the cold kills you, and there is only cold in the whole universe. The heat kills you, and there\nis only heat in the whole universe. The fragrance of incense kills you, and there is only the fragrance of\nincense in the whole universe. The sound of the bell kills you, and there is only “boooong” in the whole\nuniverse...\n~The Flatbed Sutra of Louie Wing, Ted Biringer\n“When anatta matures, one is fully and completely integrated into whatever arises till there is no difference\nand no distinction.\nWhen sound arises, fully and completely embraced with sound yet non-attached. Similarly, in life we must\nbe fully engaged yet non-attached” - John Tan\n“As John Tan pointed out before, even though anatta realization allows one to penetrate and dissolve the I,\nagent, subject, perceiver, experiencer, it does not necessarily immediately dissolve the ‘mine’ bond and\nattachment. By our karmic/deep conditioning, grasping at phenomena as objects that are ‘mine’ may still\noccur out of habit. That requires deeper wisdom and insight into emptiness and dependent origination to\nresolve. And it is only through completely dissolving all traces of I-making and mine-making that one\nachieves liberation. That is the end of all activities of appropriation, grasping, craving and identifying\n[objects as mine] – it is truly the end of suffering. In the seen only the seen.” – Soh, 2020\nThe following is a translation from the Gandhari version of the “Not Yours Sutra,” which is also paralleled in\nthe Samyutta Nikaya:\nThe Buddha said: “Monks, abandon what is not yours. Abandoning it will lead to benefit and happiness. Now,\nwhat is it that is not yours? Form is not yours; abandon it. Abandoning it will lead to benefit and happiness.\nSensation, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness are not yours; abandon them. Abandoning\nthem will lead to benefit and happiness.\n674\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Here is an example: suppose someone were to cut down the grass, wood, branches, leaves, and foliage here in\nthe Jeta forest, or were to take it away or burn it, or do whatever he wished with it. What do you think? Would\nyou think, ‘That person is cutting us, or taking us away, or burning us, or doing whatever he wished with us’?”\nThe monks answered, “Of course not, Venerable Sir.”\n“And why is that?”\n“Because this forest, Venerable Sir, is not ourselves; nor does it belong to us.”\n“In just the same way, abandon what is not yours. Abandoning it will lead to benefit and happiness. In just the\nsame way, form is not yours; abandon it. Abandoning it will lead to benefit and happiness. Sensation,\nperception, volitional formations, and consciousness are not yours; abandon them. Abandoning them will lead\nto benefit and happiness.”\nThus spoke the Lord.\n~ Wisdom\nContinue to refine one’s insights and view based on dependent origination and emptiness.

It is important to understand\nthat nondual realization is a process. Complete nondual realization is said to be extremely rare, if it is\npossible at all. But an initial realization requires between one and three years of consistent practice\nintention.\"\nI saw this quote in your forum thread Any living enlightened Master? I wonder why you quoted it, it\ndoesn’t seem relevant. Nevertheless with the recent insight into anatta, I am sure you no more concur\nwith Judith Blackstone that “Complete nondual realization is said to be extremely rare, if it is possible at\nall.” In fact not only is complete non-dual possible, it is simply the beginning. In the realm of no-mind, all\nexperiences are implicitly non-dual and effortless. This should not be a mystery to you by now.\nThe purpose of bringing up Judith Blackstone quote is not to boast about one’s achievement but to\nconvey an additional point in practice. That is in addition to experience and realization, you have to\nembrace the ‘right view’. I have mentioned to you in the article Realization and Experience and Non-Dual\nExperience from Different Perspectives, I will re-iterate it here:\n677\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nTo mature this realization, even direct experience of the absence of an agent will prove insufficient; there must\nalso be a total new paradigm shift in terms of view; we must free ourselves from being bonded to the idea, the\nneed, the urge and the tendency of analyzing, seeing and understanding our moment to moment of experiential\nreality from a source, an essence, a center, a location, an agent or a controller and rest entirely on anatta and\nDependent Origination.\nTherefore despite the clear realization and right experience, seamlessness and effortlessness of non-dual\nexperience will not be smooth without ‘right view’. The reason though obvious is often overlooked; if deep\nat the back of a practitioner’s mind he still hold the dualistic and inherent view, how is it possible to have\nseamless and effortless experience of in seeing, just scenery; in hearing, just sound? How unreserved,\nopen and seamless can a practitioner be in transcending the self altogether into the transience? Hence\nequip oneself with a view that can integrate with the realization and experience, it will help practitioners\nprogress more smoothly. Understanding the impact of view in practice is what I find lacking in many of\nyour posts. You may want to look into it.\nWith regards to the attachment of view, it does not apply to practitioners that have gone pass certain\nphases of insights. Practitioners after certain phases of insights are constantly abolishing ground and are\nclear that whatever pith instructions and views are merely provisional. There are masters that caution\npractitioners and there are students that parrot their masters’ advises, so do not follow blindly. In fact if\nunderstood correctly every deepening of view is a giving up. In the case of anatta, it is the total\nelimination of Self.\n\"Bhikkkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if you covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, do you\nunderstand this Dhamma as comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up [i.e. crossing over] and\nnot for the purpose of grasping?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Bhikkhus, as purified and bright as this view is, if you do\nnot covet, cherish, treasure and take pride in it, would you then know this Dhamma as comparable to a raft,\ntaught for the purpose of giving up [i.e. crossing over] and not for the purpose of grasping?\" \"Yes, venerable sir.\"\nsource: http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm\nComing back to your practice, there are 3 experiences that you should be familiar:” – John Tan, 2011,\ncontinue reading in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2011/03/realization-experience-and-right-\nview_13.html\n\"In seeing six rewards, it's enough motivation for a monk to establish the perception of not-self with\nregard to all phenomena without exception.

Having arisen dependent on a\ncause, it is thus impermanent, since—having arisen *in dependence* on the presence of the\ncause—the absence of the cause entails its cessation.\nConsider closely this part:\n> If in response to the presence of the condition it arises...\nWhy is it that we get from that the consequence of:\n> ... then in response to the absence of the condition it ceases.\nIt is because the arising is bound to the state of presence (of the condition). When the condition is\nno longer present, then—since it arose *dependent* on (the presence of) that condition—it will\nthus cease.\nSo, \"arising with a cause\" necessitates \"cessation when the cause disappears\".\nWhat becomes understood here is called impermanence, and when that understanding goes even\nfurther what is understood is called \"conditionedness\".2\n• Like\n• · Reply\n• · 16h\n• · Edited\n• Active NowStian Gudmundsen Høiland Being a conditioned thing, it is something \"out from\ncontrol\". Dukkha, anatta.\n... it is something completely determined by conditions—there is no \"free\" factor beside conditions\nthat could otherwise overrule its conditions and make it arise or cease. In fact, such a thing would\njust be... a condition.\n680\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nGrasping/understanding conditionedness is very close to what is called dispassion. The coming\nand going of things—and quite so by themselves—keeps the mind from fascinating about things\nas-if they were permanent and could be controlled by a single entity (this \"as-if\" attitude is quite\nunconscious and hidden from us), and this leads to a hands-off approach, i.e. doesn’t grasp and\ncling.\nEmptiness, here, very specifically means what one intuits as the lack of \"being worthy of\" or\n\"deserving\" grasping and clinging. By understanding conditionedness one intuits the reason of not\ndeserving grasping and not being worthy of clinging. This intuited \"quality\" lies very close to what\nis called dukkha and anatta. What one thus intuits or understands is called \"(the state of) being\nvoid\", but which we get translated as \"emptiness\". The result of understanding how (thus\nconditioned) things (i.e. things that are conditioned as such, i.e. arises dependent on condition, i.e.\nis conditionally arisen, i.e. conditioned arising) are void is called many things, for example\n\"dispassion\". This dispassion is tantamount to non-involvement (atammayata?) with conditioned\nthings, a slight turning away of the mind from conditioned things, which leads to what is called\nnibbāna and asaṅkhata.\nThus, by completely understanding dependent arising and conditionedness, the mind becomes\ndispassionate and does not grasp nor cling to anything conditioned. Consciousness naturally\nbecoming calm and resting through dispassion, ceases from further movements of mind and\nmental activity.\nBy completely understanding the meaning of \"conditioned\", one finally comes to direct experience\nof what is called \"unconditioned\" (& \"nirvana\").3\n• Like· Reply\n· 15h\n· Edited\n• Active NowStian Gudmundsen Høiland In short, and about the thought \"I am\":\nWhen you contemplate dependent arising & ceasing of seeing (or \"eye-contact\"), you are\nunwittingly replacing the assumption of an agent of seeing.\nSomewhere in your psyche there is a belief-ing that seeing is an act performed by an agent.\nWhen you consider that this visual awareness right here depends on eye & form and that with this\neye & form there is this visual awareness and that without this eye there would be no visual\nawareness and that without this form there would be no visual awareness, then \"I am\" with\nregards to seeing stops for as long as you remain in that understanding; there is then no \"I am\nseeing\", there is only seeing, no \"I am\" doing the seeing.\n> ...

I saw that presence was still not emptied. It was assumed to have a clarity/luminosity as an\nattribute of it. This was giving it a subtle essence or reification. I saw that the clarity/luminosity was\ndependently designated on the IS-ness of presence.

I'll give you the lead up to it as well since the mindset was probably a condition leading to the\ninsight. Having got comfortable in presence (in the seeing, just the seen, no seer for all senses), I was\nreading this blurb from the blog: The section labelled \"On Emptiness\" in\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../on-anatta-emptiness.... While this was happening I was\ninvestigating where is that voice that occurs when reading, is located. I had been getting more\ncomfortable recently looking at where thoughts occur directly and not psyching myself out because they\ndon't seem to exist in space. I did this for awhile noticing how the reading continues, the eyes move on\ntheir own, and this voice of the text is appearing as a vague somewhere. After getting really settled at\nlooking at this voice and how it is non-local (doesn't have a location of itself) which gives a feeling of it's\nemptiness, I realized that presence itself is still being grasped at, specifically the clarity aspect. I\ninvestigated this by looking directly at presence itself (which also has no location) and seeing that it\ndoesn't have clarity as an attribute as it's existence. More that there is presence and we give it the\nattribute \"clarity\" with our mind as a conceptual designation only. It doesn't inherently exist like that. At\n683\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nthis point from my previous practices in seeing things as conceptual designations only, the mind saw\npresence was empty and stopped grasping it. At that moment I saw how there was still subtle grasping at\nthe clarity of presence and how it was even nicer to let that go.\nAWAKENINGTOREALITY.COM\nOn Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\nOn Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\n1\n• ·\nReply\n• · 21h\nNick Wilson\nThat's fantastic, thanks so much Jayson.

It is quite easy to show a worldly person\nthe contradiction in their thinking. Wetness and water are not two different things; therefore wetness is\nnot the nature of water. Heat and fire are not two different things, therefore, heat is not the nature of fire,\netc. For example, one can ask them, \"Does wetness depend on water, or water on wetness?\" If they claim\nwetness depends on water, ask them, where is there water that exists without wetness? If they claim the\nopposite, that water depends on wetness, ask them, where is there wetness that exists without water? If\nthere is no wetness without water nor water without wetness, they can easily be shown that wetness is\nnot a nature of water, but merely a name for the same entity under discussion. Thus, the assertion that\nwetness is the nature of water cannot survive analysis. The assertion of all other natures can be\neliminated in the same way.\n...\nThen not only are you ignorant of the English language, but you are ignorant of Candrakīrti where, in the\nPrasannapāda, he states that the only nature is the natureless nature, emptiness.\nThen, if it is asked what is this dharmatā of phenomena, it is the essence of phenomena. If it is ask what is\nan essence, it is a nature [or an inherent existence, rang bzhin]. If it is asked what is an inherent existence\n[or nature], it is emptiness. If it is asked what is emptiness, it is naturelessness [or absence of inherent\nexistence]. If it is asked what is the absence of inherent existence [or naturelessness], it is suchness\n[tathāta]. If it is asked what is suchness, it is the essence of suchness that is unchanging and permanent,\nthat is, because it is not fabricated it does not arise in all aspects and because it is not dependent, it is\ncalled the nature [or inherent existence] of fire, etc.\"\nLabels: Ācārya Malcolm Smith, Emptiness, Madhyamaka |\n688\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSoh Wei Yu\n[9:26 AM, 6/3/2020] John Tan: That [heat being a characteristic of fire] is precisely not prasangika and is\nrejected that heat is a characteristic of fire and wetness is a characteristic of water.\n[9:27 AM, 6/3/2020] John Tan: In tsongkhapa difficult points, he rejected awareness.\n·\nReply\nSoh Wei Yu\nAnyway it's a good insight you're having. Adding this to post-anatta contemplation in AtR guide.\n“There is popularized “vipaśyanā” or vipassana, which is a meditation style that co-opted the Pali term,\nand then real vipaśyanā.\nThe former is a meditation style that seems to be a glorified version of śamatha, although I don’t know\nthe specifics of it. The latter, is a clear insight that cognizes the emptiness of phenomena, which is the\ntrue meaning of vipaśyanā. Defined as such in the Akṣayamati-nirdeśa:\nThe consciousness that perceives the entry into reality is called \"vipaśyanā.\" So-called vipaśyanā is perceiving\nphenomena correctly, perceiving phenomena as they are, perceiving phenomena truly, and perceiving\nphenomena as not otherwise, perceiving phenomena as empty, without characteristics, without aspiration,\nperceiving phenomena to be unformed, likewise, nonarisen, unproduced, insubstantial, just as they are, pure,\nand as isolated. It is perceiving phenomena as unmoving, inactive, without self, wholly without grasping,\ninseparable, one taste, as the nature of space, and nirvana by nature.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\nThe Trouble With Agency\n“\nFiled under Prose\nAgency implies an agent. If there is no agent, there can be no agency. Agency, of course, is the action or\nintervention of a thing, or person, that produces an effect. To say that language can’t capture the truth is\neven more true when silly things are being stated. So when someone talks about causes and conditions,\nthey are being silly because these are not the same. A cause is that which makes a thing happen. It implies\nan agent and agency–a veritable proliferation of sillinesses. A condition is that which opens the possibility\nof something happening. But conditions can never cause anything to happen because they are neither an\nagent nor have agency. Perhaps this surprises you. But think about all the things you thought were going\nto happen in your life that didn’t, and all the things that did that you never saw coming! Scientists call this\nstochastic behavior–it extends all the way down to the quantum level (and perhaps especially there!). It’s\nthe reason why a computer needs a clock, that coordinates all the stochastic behavior of electronic\ncomponents so that the device can actually accomplish the tasks it has been engineered to allow to happen.\n689\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nNotice I didn’t say “make happen,” because sometimes things don’t. And we’ve probably all experienced\nthat too.\nOften, in our attempts to make sense of reality, we fall into old habits of thought that arise from an\nunderstanding in our heads that things do things. Exorcising that understanding happens naturally when\na certain point is reached, but without the direct experience, silliness abounds.\nParmenides, an Ancient Greek philosopher once wrote a poem about his insights into reality. He didn’t use\nany pronouns, and few, if any nouns. Smart people, thinking they knew what he meant, supplied a lot of\nadditional wording that made the poem easier to read, but empty of truth. Then, once that was done, they\nrealized that Parmenides hadn’t said the right thing in the right way, so they fixed that up too. When\nParmenides said: “the same: to be and wherefore is intuitive awareness” (“ταὐτὸν δ᾽ ἐστὶ νοεῖν τε καὶ οὓνεκέν\nἐστι νόημα”), equating the manifesting appearances and selfless knowing, they clarified it, equating “being”\nwith “thinking,” turning it into a kind of “I think, therefore I am!” statement instead. Silliness. Neither the\nGreek word for thought, nor for thinking appears anywhere in Parmenides’ statement.\nSo, try to make sense of conditions, not as any kind of interaction between entities, not even in a\nmetaphorical fashion. Instead, think of how a seed grows. The sun doesn’t cause the seed to grow, any\nmore than rain does, or the soil, or all the bacteria, fungi, animals, and other plants do. Yet, for the seed to\ngrow, all of those conditions need to be right, including the condition of the seed being present.\nAs to what causes the seed to grow, well, just let the idea of causes go. It involves agents and agency, and\nthey are just silly nonsense. Understand that when the right conditions are present, the possibility of\ngenesis is present, but what actually happens is uncaused.\nNow divest that scenario of all sense of things inherent in it. Sunlight isn’t a thing, except as a concept.\nNeither is water, or soil, or all the life present in soil. These are all just ideas, ways to talk about reality in\nshorthand. Instead, see an amazing, and coherent presencing of selfless naturing. Don’t even hold onto the\n690\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nidea of a nature, as something doing the naturing. It will cause a cognitive dissonance that will tire you out,\nbut the effort lays a groundwork for the direct experience to come. It’s all just more conditioning, and in\nthis case, it’s called mind training, but it could be called mind conditioning as well, because you are not\nmaking anything happen, you are only developing the right conditions for certain experiences to happen.\nSo remember: there is no mind, instead there is just this awesome and beautiful selfless naturing. Or if you\nprefer, there is just this awesome and beautiful selfless minding. But no nature and no mind anywhere–\njust the appearance of awesome beauty.\nReflect on that phrase, “awesome beauty.” Another way of expressing it, that I use, is the visceral essence\nof selfless loving. But you can just call it bliss instead.” - James M. Corrigan\n“Empty phenomena ~ Nagarjuna\nAll beings consist of causes and effects,\nIn which there is no ‘sentient being’ at all.\nFrom phenomena which are exclusively empty,\nThere arise only empty phenomena.\nAll things are devoid of any ‘I’ or ‘mine’.\nLike a recitation, a candle, a mirror, a seal,\nA magnifying glass, a seed, sourness, or a sound,\nSo also with the continuation of the aggregates —\nThe wise should know they are not transferred.\nNagarjuna\nThe Heart of Dependent Origination, verse 4 & 5”\n“Perfection of no-mind is not possible in my opinion without complete integration of the general principle\nof Dependent Origination, and very clear penetration of the problem of dualistic/inherent framework. That\nis even after very mature phase 5, no-mind is not necessarily perfected. One has to continue to refine the\nview.” - John Tan, 2013\n“Post anatta insight, what is important is how is one to practice in the conventional world of relatives where\ntraces of imprint are still intact.\nHow is one to exhaust the karmic imprints and what view will stop one from harbouring the inherent and\ndualistic tendencies.\n691\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n\"Seeing is only seen, no seer\" helps in triggering experiential insight of anatta but it is not an appropriate\nview for the conditioned mind to function effectively and efficiently in a conventional world.\nEmbrace the view of dependent arising fully, a precious and perfect view for anatta practitioners.” - John\nTan, 2019\nHowever, there should be a balance.\n“When you are luminous and transparent, don't think of dependent origination or emptiness, that is [the\ncontemplative practice for] post-equipoise. When hearing sound, like the sound of flowing water and\nchirping bird, it is as if you are there. It should be non-conceptual, no sense of body or me, transparent, as\nif the sensations stand out. You must always have some quality time into this state of anatta. Means you\ncannot keep losing yourself in verbal thoughts, you got to have quality hours dedicated to relaxation and\nexperience fully without self, without reservation.\" - John Tan, 2018\n“The only truth is to see the emptiness of the conventional. Equipoise strictly speaking is free from all\nelaborations. That is exactly the experiential insight and taste of anatta, in the seen just the seen, therefore\nno seer, no seeing, nothing seen.” – John Tan, 2020\n“[12:18 PM, 7/7/2020] John Tan: The awakening for phases of insight is centred on two aspects really. The\ndirect taste of clarity and the full blown freedom from the perceiver and perceived. This is mark by anatta\nwhere the insight into no-self is the key to the floodgate. It is THE key insight that lead to effortless and\nspontaneous non-dual expression that is free from perceiver and perceived.\n[12:20 PM, 7/7/2020] John Tan: Emptiness goes further and so does total exertion. It penetrates deeply into\nthe conventional world and see how powerful constructs affect the intellectual mind and the breadth and\ndepth of freeing oneself from all these mental constructs.\n[10:09 AM, 7/9/2020] John Tan: The problem is the thought. Thought after thought 念念.\nThis continuous stream of thoughts form a chain that is still under the deep influence of the dualistic and\ninherent paradigm that prevents the seeing.\nSo despite the training like your 人乘 teaching to lengthen the gap between thoughts, each arising thought\nis still under the influence and prevents the clear seeing. Therefore you need right view with certain training\nto slow down the thoughts to allow the clear seeing of what the view of anatta, DO is trying to convey. So\nthat when each thought arises, it can with the help of the view, see the actuality of what is going on. So\nthat it can authenticate the view, to realize in real time the \"always and already is\" of anatta.\nOnce it is authenticate, you are the view is no more needed, it is real time actualization and one realizes\nthat the state of no mind that is free from a perceiver and perceived is always effortlessly manifesting.\n692\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nNext step you can ask people if it is always so, how is it that we can still be in confusion?\nThis paradox or koan will trigger another insight to allow practitioner to clearly understand what liberates.\nAs I told you, whether in confusion or realization it is always in a state of no mind and no-self otherwise\nconfusion is not possible as I explain to you about ignorance. So what exactly liberates?

Nevertheless, experientially\nseeing through self/Self is still most crucial.\nSoh: Highly recommend reading Geoff’s Measureless Mind PDF\nhttps://app.box.com/s/nxby5606lbaei9oudiz6xsyrdasacqph , there are excerpts here:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com.au/2012/09/great-resource-of-buddha-teachings.html\nOn Impermanence, Empty Nature and Self-Liberation:\n“While revisiting the posts by Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche (many good articles by him\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../marshland-flowers...), found an excerpt where he distinguished\nGaudapada from Buddhadharma:\nhttps://www.byomakusuma.org/VedantaVisAVisShentong.html\nExcerpt:\n\"Sankaràcàrya even mentions the exact opposite view of what Śāntarakṣita mentioned above and refutes\nhim. In exact opposite of what Śāntarakṣita says, “The error in the view of these philosophers is a slight\none – due only to the assertion of eternality of cognition.” Sankara says about the Chittamatra “The error\nin the view of these philosophies is only slight - they believe the non-dual mind as changing moment to\nmoment; we believe it as unchanging eternal.”\nIf the meaning of the Uttara Tantra is what the Shentongpas make it out to be, it would have existed in\nthe Indian sources too. Sankara would certainly have written that the view of these Buddhist philosophers\nas what the Vedas had always taught and that Buddhism is just a branch of Hinduism. Even today, if any\n694\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nIndian Hindu philosopher comes across the Shentong view, they would be most happy to embrace it as\nthe correct view and take it as a solid proof that Buddhism is just a branch of Hinduism and the Buddha\ndid not teach anything new. This of course blatantly contradicts what the Buddha himself said in\nMahayana, Theravada, and Sarvàstivàda Sutras and Sàstra-s. The Buddha said that he taught something\nthat had been lost for a long time. But the Vedas and the Vedic Bràhmins of the Buddha’s time, whom the\nBuddha met, had been and are still teaching the existence of true âtmà, and ‘eternal non-dual cognition’\nas the Ultimate Reality.\nIf we glance through the Jain literature, we again find that no Jain scholar mentions that the Buddhists\nbelieved in an eternal / permanent non-dual cognition as the ultimate reality. At least, those Jain scholars\nafter Asanga should have done so, if that was how the Uttara Tantra had been interpreted in India.\nIf we analyze both the Hindu Sankaràcàrya’s and the Buddhist Śāntarakṣita’s, we find that both agree that\nthe view of the Hindu Advaita Vedànta is that the ultimate reality (âtmà) is an unchanging, eternal non-\ndual cognition. The Buddhists as a whole do not agree that the ultimate reality is an eternal, unchanging\nnon-dual cognition, but rather a changing eternal non-dual cognition. These statements found in the 6th\ncentury Hindu text and the refutations of the Hindu view found in the 9th century Buddhist texts (both of\nwhich were after the Uttara Tantra and Asanga), show that the Hindu view of the ultimate reality as an\nunchanging, eternal non-dual cognition is non-existent amongst the Buddhists of India. Not only was such\na view non-existent amongst Buddhists of India, but it was also refuted as a wrong view by scholars like\nŚāntarakṣita. He even writes that if and when Buddhists use the word ‘eternal’ (nitya), it means ‘parinàmi\nnitya’, i.e., changing eternal, and not the Hindu kind of eternal, which always remains unchanged.\nThe Hindu âtmà is not only non-dual cognition but is also unchanging, eternal, and truly existing.\nSankaràcàrya defines existence (sat) in his Tattvaboda as that which remains the same in all the 3 times\n(past, present, future). In the commentary by Gaudapàda (who was Sankaràcàrya’s Guru’s Guru), of the\nMàndukya Upanishada, in verse number 96, he calls the eternally really existing non-dual cognition is\nnon-relational, i.e., free from reference points. In the 37th verse of the same work it is said that this non-\ndual, eternal, really existing cognition is free from all sense organs, i.e., free from the dualistic mind\n(namshe). So the Upanishadic view is that the really existing, eternal / permanent, non-dual, non-\nreferential cognition is the âtmà, and this is not dualistic mind. This Upanishadic view existed even before\nthe Buddha, and this was what Sankaràcàrya expounded very clearly and most powerfully around the 6th\ncentury. This view, similar to this Sankara view, was refuted by Śāntarakṣita as a wrong view.\nThe Vedàntic Sutras and Sàstra-s are full of statements like:\n1. This âtmà is truly existent beyond existence and non-existence.\n2. This is truly non-dual beyond dual and non-dual.\n3. This âtmà is the Great Thing (mahàvastu), which is permanent beyond permanent and\nimpermanent, etc., etc.\n4. It is empty of all qualities (nirguna), which means empty of foreign qualities, but not empty (of\nitself), i.e., not empty of being a truly existing permanent entity (sat); not empty of being non-dual\ncoginition (cit), and not empty of bliss (ànanda). Sat-cit-ànanda is the nature of this âtmà (or non-\ndual cognition).\n695\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nIf you have understood what I have written above, it is easy to understand why when Ringo Tulku\npresented the Shentong view in an Indian symposium, all the Hindu Indian scholars happily agreed with it\nand told him happily, “This is the same view as our Vedanta!.” Also, a few centuries ago, Jonangpa Kunga\nDrol Chog, a throne holder of the Jonangpa, had visited Muktinàth, where he presented his views to the\nHindu yogis present there. These Hindu yogis also called him a genuine Hindu yogi after they heard his\nShentong view.\"\nOther than the 'multiplicity' which Greg Goode said was a distinction between Advaitic and Emptiness\nrealization ( https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../greg-goode-on... ), the 'permanence' 'unchanging'\npart is also another point that differs:\n“Although Bhāviveka doesn’t struggle that much, he is quite clear:\n“Since [the tīrthika position of] self, permanence, all pervasiveness and oneness contradict their opposite,\n[the Buddhist position of] no-self, impermanence, non-pervasiveness and multiplicity, they are completely\ndifferent.” – Kyle Dixon, 2020\n“Bhāviveka demonstrates the proper way to view buddhanature:\nThe statement \"The tathāgata pervades\" means wisdom pervades all objects of knowledge, but it does not mean\nabiding in everything like Viśnu. Further, \"Tathāgatagarbhin\" means emptiness, signlessness and absence of\naspiration exist the continuums of all sentient beings, but is not an inner personal agent pervading everyone.” –\nKyle Dixon, 2021\nThis is also a point made by JT in Difference Between Thusness Stage 4 and 5 (Substantial Non-duality vs\nAnatta) https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../difference-between...\nAlso, the post above also demonstrates what John Tan said before (and years ago he made a similar\ncomment about certain teachers mistaking freedom from extremes in a similar way):\n\"...sounded like instead of \"freedom\" from the 4 extremes of the tetralemma, there seem to be an\nestablishment of a super Awareness that \"transcends\" the 4 extremes. Tetralemma has always been quite\nproblematic that is why Tsongkhapa added qualifiers like \"exist conventionally\" and \"not exist\nultimately\" to present the tetralemma in a more logical fashion whereas other schools simply see the\npurpose is to pacify the mind from all views, notions and concepts instead of finding \"something\" that can\ntranscend or satisfy all the 4 conditions.\nAnyway it will be seen as quite final by any practitioner that collapses both subject and object into pure\nseeing. Unless 缘 arises to relinquish both awareness and phenomena, whatever said will be quite futile\nfor now.\"\nBackground of Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche:\n\"A student of Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rinpoche informed me that Rinpoche has recently revised his\n696\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\narticle Madhyamika Buddhism Vis-a-vis Hindu Vedanta and uploaded one new article on Nyingma (a\nschool of Tibetan Buddhism)'s view. Rinpoche also personally asked his student to inform me about their\nfree online magazine, I thanked the guru and signed up. I also mentioned that I have dreamt of receiving\nteachings from him before, perhaps some karmic connection...\nAfter the e-mail I did a little research and found a biography (Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-\noveGtYYgU, Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V_MV5aAyZg,\nhttp://www.byomakusuma.org/TheVidyadhara.html) of this great teacher Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar\nRinpoche. He used to practice the Hindu tantras and Vedanta under a qualified Vedanta teacher for nine\nyears intensely in the cemetaries, etc. Eventually he realized the Atman-Brahman, the ultimate goal of\nHinduism, and his realization was confirmed by his Vedantic masters to be correct and profound.\nHowever, still unsatisfied with his realization, he continued searching, first into Zen Buddhism, then later\ninto the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, including the Vajrayana Tantras, Mahamudra and Dzogchen\nteachings, and practiced them thoroughly until he attained realization and was asked to start teaching by\nhis teachers. His main practise is of the Lamdre system of teachings in the Sakya school. Despite having\npractised the teachings thoroughly and attained realization, he continues to go into deep meditation\nretreats for over a decade to deepen his enlightenment/experience and was given the title 'Mahayogi' and\n'Rinpoche' by H.E. Chobgay Trichen Rinpoche. He continues to be in practice retreats and share his\nknowledge with others at the same time.\nAs one of the few great Buddhist teachers in Nepal where the majority of the population belong to the\nHindu faith, a place where myths and misconceptions of Buddhism are abound, he is in a great position\nto correct all of these misconceptions and do an accurate and unbiased comparison between the\nteachings of Buddhism vis-a-vis Hinduism due to his deep knowledge and experience of the Buddhist\nteachings as well as his previous experience with the Hindu tradition. He emphasizes that the comparison\nwas done not in order to demean one system of teaching over another but to provide greater clarity on\nthe essential doctrines of each system so that they could each be understood correctly, as he says, \"I\nmust reiterate that this difference in both the system is very important to fully understand both the\nsystems properly and is not meant to demean either system.\"\nAnyway, I looked further into their website and over the past few days I've read through all the\narticles of Marshland Flowers (from series 1 to 7) and highly recommend them - they deal with\nseveral subjects of dharma including anatman (non-self), emptiness, dependent origination, the\nfour noble truths, Buddhism vis-a-vis Hinduism, rebirth, karmic propensities (samskaras),\nmeditation, vipassana (insight meditation), shamatha (calm abiding meditation), siddhis/powers,\nthe tenets of Sravakayana and Mahayana Buddhism, as well as Tantras, Buddhism and science, etc\netc. All these articles are of great quality, well written and highly recommended. All in all, it\nprovides a pretty complete overall understanding of the core/fundamental Buddhist teachings.\n697\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nI've added this blog entry to the 'Stickied Posts' section of this blog (see right hand corner).\"” – Soh,\n2020\n•\nAditya Prasad\nSoh Wei Yu\nI am not claiming that the antidote to eternalism is nihilism etc. I am saying that when one is stuck seeing\nthe nature as multiplicity only (for example), the medicine is to notice how it instead appears as singular\nwhen the view is changed.

That is the emptiness of all dharmas.\nAditya Prasad\nSoh Wei Yu\nI am not talking about collapsing the many into one.\n\"therefore impermanence is more accurate than permanence\"\nI am claiming that neither one is \"more accurate\" in any intrinsic or ultimate sense. \"Impermanence\" is\nonly \"accurate\" in the sense that it releases a particular kind of grasping that sentient beings have (that of\npermanence). For those who are clinging to impermanence, more insistence on impermanence will not\nbe helpful, and in that sense will not be \"more accurate.\"\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nIn anatta, impermanence is directly authenticated as simply the dynamic and traceless nature of\nappearances. It is not about having a conceptual view of impermanence, it is about the direct\nauthentication of 'in hearing only sound, no hearer', 'in seeing only scenery, no seer', 'in thinking only\nthoughts, no thinker'. Everything is gapless and direct and luminous. Yet there is no staying, totally\ndynamic and traceless like drawing on water. Of course, you're right that there can be a subtle view\nremaining of dharmas having subtle existences arising and ceasing in flickering speed. That too must be\nseen through, then one realises and tastes the non-arisen nature of dharmas.\n699\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAditya Prasad\nSoh Wei Yu\nYes. There is a direct authentication that there never was a permanent anything (either perceived or\nperceiver) and therefore the term \"impermanence\" seems to be \"more accurate\" for the time being. And\nthen it is seen that even this term can subtly imply temporariness in time. When time is utterly\ntranscended, neither term can apply. Same with all other pairs of terms. That is the problem I have with\nKyle's assertion that Buddhism rejects permanence in favor of impermanence etc. It actually transcends\nall such dualities. I know he knows better, but the language can be misleading.\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nKyle's post is correct if understood in context.\nOf course, Kyle also wrote in 2015,\n\"Phenomena appear to arise and cease from the standpoint of ignorance [avidyā], however, once we\nawaken to recognize the nature [dharmatā] of phenomena [dharmas], their emptiness, we realize that\nthey are non-arisen [anutpāda], and are like illusions.\nNāgārjuna is saying when you are not in recognition of the dharmatā of phenomena, you are deluded\nand they appear to be impermanent entities. Once you awaken, you no longer perceive impermanence,\nbecause you no longer perceive conditioned entities.\"\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\n- https://www.reddit.com/.../comments/guzwve/impermanence/\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nI do not think that Bhavaviveka, who is a master of Madhyamika, would not be aware of this. He is\npointing out that Buddhists teach the non-abiding nature of consciousness in contrast to the non-\nBuddhist view about an unchanging or permanent consciousness. He is not trying to establish the\nultimacy of arising/abiding/subsiding momentary dharmas like certain 'Hinayana schools'.\n·\nReply\n· 13m\n700\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\no 06 Nov `10, 9:30AM\nOriginally posted by simpo_:\nYah...\nNon-duality is more obvious when it is experienced.\nNo-self is a more subtle insight. There is a subtle 'switch'. It is this subtle switch that allows for the arising\nand passing away as the 'self' is not blocking the arising from passing away.\nI hope i am getting it right... :) Hope for Thusness' input and advise.\nJohn Tan/Thusness replied:\nYes Simpo [Sim Pern Chong],\nThat is what I understand too. There are subtle differences between Advaita non-duality and buddhist's\nanatta both in terms of realization and experience.\nWhen contemplating on the subject of 'no-self', the mind of the practitioner is directed towards the\ntransient phenomena and upon the ripening of conditions, the mind suddenly sees the illusionary\ndivision of subject-object duality; with the maturing of this realization, experience becomes seamlessly\nwhole. There is no hearer in hearing or perceiver in perceiving, just simply a sense of perception. In\nterms of this experience, they are similar.\nHowever although the blinding bond of 'duality' is dissolved, the tendency to see things 'inherently' isn't.\nThe practitioners continue to resort back to a Self despite after the clear seeing of this truth and rest their\nunderstanding of 'no-self based on Self'. This is substantialist non-duality. There is an ultimate essence\nand abiding in Self is still the way towards liberation and there is also the temptation to treat this\nexperience as a sort of pseudo finality.\nBuddhism on the other hand sees this experience and realization as the first step in the 8 fold path --\nright view. It means right view of anatta is fully authenticated with this non-dual experience but\nBuddhist’s non-dual is non-abiding, groundless and essence-less. There is no resorting back to an\nultimate essence and the entire idea of liberation is based on seeing clearly the anatta, non-substantiality,\nessence-less empty nature of whatever arises, including Awareness or Self. Experience is luminously non-\ndual yet empty.\nTherefore in Buddhism, besides the experience, right view is very important. Upon the clearing seeing of\n‘no division’, it is advisable to penetrate further into the impermanent nature of phenomena both at the\nmicro and macro level of experience. In terms of practice, there is no letting go to an ultimate ground or\ngreat void but the letting go is due to the thorough insight of the ‘empty nature’ of all arising -- Reality is\nperpetually ‘letting go’.\n701\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSo in addition to the non-dual seamless experience, there must also be the clear experience of perpetual\nletting go of non-holding to whatever arises. Therefore when AEN told me non-dual presence, the\nNDNCDIMOP or being lock up permanently in PCEs of the AF as the key solution to eliminate emotion,\npride and anger…the 10 fetters, I told him not yet, not because I am stubbornly attached to Buddha's\nteaching but because that is my realization and experience. :-)\nThe journey towards 'no-self' is analogous to peeling an onion. Practitioner goes through the process of\npeeling from dissolving of personality and identity to non-conceptuality to non-duality to realization of the\nlack of ownership to clear seeing of 'no agent behind transient phenomena to the empty nature of\nwhatever arises. As we peel, the 'willingness' to let go certain aspects of 'self'/Self' grow and with more\n'willingness' to let go, we come closer to seeing the true face of freedom.\nDeeper clinging to a Self is not washed away with the non-dual insight. There must be further integration\nof the ‘non-dual’ experience into this arising and passing away, this impermanent nature, to dissolve the\nillusionary sense of self, anger, emotion, pride even the non-dual presence that we treasure so much; let\nwhatever arises goes, be it during the waking, dreaming or deep sleep state. There will then come a time\nwhere a practitioner realizes the same ‘taste’ of the 3 states as there is no holding of the non-dual\npresence and all experiences turn natural, effortless and self-liberating.\nJust my 2 cents. :)\nEdited by Thusness 06 Nov `10, 3:09PM\nAlso see: Self-Liberation through Seeing with Naked Awareness in English & Chinese\nquote:\nOriginally posted by longchen:\nThis is really good. Sure spell out the different subtle attachments.\nIt also in a way explain why there can so many different types of mystical or transcendental\nexperiences. All are but the various types of subtle attachments giving rise to different understandings\nand experiences.\nThanks so much. It is helpful for me\nJohn Tan/Thusness:\nHi Longchen [Sim Pern Chong],\nNot only that. This work by Padmasambhava is truly deep and profound; it discloses the self-liberating\naspect of our intrinsic nature. It is especially important for you now.\n702\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAt that time when you posted the thread of non-dual and karmic pattern,\nhttp://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&thread_id=225462, the condition is only right for\nunderstanding 'the strength of karmic propensities’, as such, this aspect was not disclosed. Instead,\nthe second door of impermanence was introduced and it was introduced with the purpose to\ncomplement the no-self experience you had in order to give rise to this insight of “Self-Liberation”\n. The sole purpose of the practice of the second door of impermanence is for this insight to arise.\nI was reading some commentaries about this work, I was disappointed; and with all due respect, I must\nsay it is terribly distorted. The commentator has transformed this great work of Padmasambhava to an\nAdvaita or neo-Advaita teaching. Self Liberating nature of our pristine nature is not to posit naked-\nawareness as a background where “all thoughts arise and subside’ and the background is not affected by\nthis transient nature of thoughts, it remains constant, changeless and unmoved. ‘Self liberation’ should\nnever be taken to mean this.\nThere is no Awareness apart from the arising and ceasing of thoughts and yet thought spontaneously\narise and subsides in its own accord (self-liberating). It liberates at that very moment of ‘passing away’\n(the practice of second door) without the need of effort, simply so. From moment to moment it is so. Thus\ncomes and thus goes. This is its emptiness nature. The emptiness nature liberates instantaneously. By\nsimply so, it is spontaneously self-perfected.\nSentient mind however posit a ‘self’ and holds. Whether the “thought” is good or bad, it attempts to do\nsomething to change, whatever direction it goes either good or bad, all is ‘doing’ (karma) and prevents the\nliberating nature. However without the experience of no-self (Buddhism non-duality not Adviata non-\ndual), one can never understand this intuitively.\nDo read with a reverent heart. Homage to Padmasambhava.\nquote:\nHow can you say that you cannot find your own mind?\nThe mind is just that which is thinking:\n(My opinion is it should be translated to “The mind is just the thinking” but I do not have the original text.)\nAnd yet, although you have searched (for the thinker), how can you say that you do not find him?\nWith respect to this, nowhere does there exist the one who is the cause of (mental) activity.\nAnd yet, since activity exists, how can you say that such activity does not arise?\n703\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nSince merely allowing (thoughts) to settle into their own condition, without trying to modify them in any way, is\nsufficient,\nHow can you say that you are not able to remain in a calm state?\nSince allowing (thoughts) to be just as they are, with out trying to do anything about them, is sufficient,\nHow can you say that you are not able to do anything with regard to them?\nSince clarity, awareness, and emptiness are inseparable and are spontaneously self-perfected,\nHow can you say that nothing is accomplished by your practice?\nSince (intrinsic awareness) is self-originated and spontaneously self-perfected without any antecedent causes or\nconditions,\nHow can you say that you are not able to accomplish anything by your efforts?\nSince the arising of discursive thoughts and their being liberated occur simultaneously,\nHow can you say that you are unable to apply an antidote?\nSince your own immediate awareness is just this,\nHow can you say that you do not know anything with regard to it?\nAnd\nquote:\nIt is certain that all of the diverse characteristics of things are liberated into their own condition,\nLike clouds in the atmosphere that are self-originated and self-liberated.\nYou should look at your own mind to see whether it is like that or not.\n704\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“(12:25 AM) Thusness: No Self as non-dual eliminates the witnessing background leading to the\ndissolution of subject-object split whereas the practice of second door of impermanence eliminates the\nself from karmic momentum leading to non-attachment and fearlessness.\n(12:25 AM) Thusness: The first part is experienced while the 2nd part isn't.\n(12:25 AM) AEN: icic..\n(12:26 AM) AEN: how come impermanence leads to eliminating self from karmic momentum?\n(12:26 AM) Thusness: impermanence is?\n(12:27 AM) AEN: change? lol\n(12:27 AM) AEN: self liberating?\n(12:29 AM) Thusness: kok ur head\n(12:29 AM) Thusness: what is the difference between impermanence and letting go?\n(12:32 AM) AEN: back\n(12:32 AM) AEN: hmm i mean bcos of impermanence that the karmic momentum 'let goes' itself?\n(12:33 AM) Thusness: no\n(12:34 AM) AEN: hmm dunno hehehe\n(12:34 AM) Thusness: lol\n(12:34 AM) Thusness: impermanence is characteristic of reality\n(12:35 AM) Thusness: it flows in its own accord\n(12:35 AM) AEN: icic\n(12:35 AM) Thusness: nothing needs be done\n(12:35 AM) Thusness: whereas letting go is really a form of holding\n(12:36 AM) Thusness: the second door is to developed to experience this insight and experience the\npassing away on its own accord\n(12:37 AM) Thusness: there is nothing to hold or release\n(12:37 AM) AEN: icic..\n(12:37 AM) Thusness: it is practice to see and experience this reality\n(12:38 AM) Thusness: what are karmic propensities?\n(12:38 AM) Thusness: how is it sustained?\n(12:40 AM) AEN: hmm\n(12:40 AM) AEN: icic\n(12:41 AM) AEN: \"it flows in its own accord\" \"nothing needs be done\" isnt this self liberation?\n(12:41 AM) AEN: what i meant was this..\n(12:41 AM) AEN: From a pure insight practice point of view, you can’t ever fundamentally “let go” of\nanything, so I sometimes wish the popularity of this misleading and indifference-producing admonition\nwould decline, or at least be properly explained.

The article by One Thought Traveler in Mindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati) expresses\nanatta and matures it into total exertion. It is good to be somatic and learn a technique to help regulate\none’s energy to prevent energy imbalances, such as Vase Breathing (scroll towards the end of the chapter\non Tips on Energy Imbalances). I would say Anapanasati is even more important than Vipassana after\nanatta, not because vipassana is less important but rather vipassana has become a natural and effortless\nongoing state after anatta, however one still needs to practice Anapanasati/Vase Breathing for developing\nthe other qualities like calmness, as well as the other seven factors of enlightenment, and regulate one’s\nenergies. At some point, one will feel that the seven factors of enlightenment becomes very strong. One\nfeels a strong sense of tranquil presence not only in sitting, but even in every step walking forward. This is\na sign that one’s practice is maturing.\n\"There are 3 parts: no self, the karmic memory patterning, the luminous presence\nAre you able to sense them...\nIf you were listening to a familiar song, you don't have memory of it?\nAre you mindful of that, there is a luminous radiance presence and there is the content... inseparable but\ncan be felt at the same time. Like when I drink honey water...there is the fluid and there is the taste of\nhoney.\nThat is why you have to practice. One is without the meditator, with luminous radiance presence mixed\nwith subtle content, the other is luminous radiance presence...\nPost anatta, attention can just be focused on the radiance presence alone free of content...completely\nbare... But don't practice at night...\" – John Tan, 2020\n“You must also practice sitting meditation and have quality time in anatta free from apprender and\napprehended, experience whatever sensations as insubstantial and light, natural and luminous.

Ordinarily these dimensions are confused and held to be one.\nThe yogi, having developed the ability to distinguish between these dimensions, is capable of focussing\nthe attention on the dimension of uninterpreted Radiance alone relatively untainted by interpretation,\neven as interpretation may be present in experience. They then experience this Presence with sensitivity\nand intelligence, discovering that this actuality of naked Radiance is in its characteristics explicitly, utterly\nbeyond the narrow oversimplified versions of it that the interpretations imply.

Torei in particular lays it out from\nbeginning to end, including foundations, common pitfalls, dangers of stopping half-way or fixating upon a\npartial realization, etc...so much so that his most famous text has long been used as a standard guide for\ntrainees. Anyone studying Hakuin's Keiso Dokuzui would have the same map, which tallies of course with\neverything Shido Bunan wrote earlier. It is all extremely clear upon reading, though reading and grasping\nthe layout of the path naturally is not at all equivalent to the process of walking the ground.\n…\nIt is clearly delineated how this is conceived to happen, but details of how to actualize what is discussed\nand what is in fact signified by specific experiences that are mentioned to which the reader has not yet\nattained are of course uncovered over time, with experiential transformation, and in communication with\nthe teacher who can display the embodied result and confirm the significant points. These writings are\ngeneral maps useful to avoid getting lost, but one's actual guide on the ground gives the practical\ninstructions that fit the often varying conditions. None of these writings are - or could be - sufficient for\nanyone to walk the path alone without a teacher's guidance, except possibly in the case of a person of\nextremely deep roots and unusual capacity. But since such persons are so exceedingly rare as to not be\nworth talking about, we general don't.\n…\nZen considers the paramitas to be wholly fulfilled within the path of recognizing one's nature and then,\ntaking that as the foundation of subsequent practice, dissolving habitual delusion along the path of\nembodying seamless realization. At the moment one genuinely recognizes one's nature, the essential\npoint of all practices and paths is known with certainty, and a great confidence arises. Who cares about\ngradual vs. sudden at that point?\n…\nThere are many so-called samadhis describing various aspects of the function of wisdom and gates such\nas the senses (e.g. samadhi of hearing, as pointed to in Hekiganroku 46), the elements (e.g. fire samadhi),\nthe secret three-year practice of jewel mirror samadhi and alternating samadhi of hen/sho realized in\npenetration of the five ranks along the Rinzai path, etc. But in Zen practice these are all reducible to the\none essential point, which is the fulfillment of vipashyana and shamatha in non-departure from the\nseamless upwelling of what is recognized in kensho.\nIf we have this recognition of our nature, confirmed by a genuine teacher, then we have entered the gate\n712\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nof Zen practice. If we are on the path of clarifying and embodying it, taking a heroic aspiration of the four\nvows as motivation, then we are actually walking that path.

How could it be contingent on practice and realization?\nThe true vehicle is self-sufficient. What need is there for special effort? Indeed, the whole body is free\nfrom dust. Who could believe in a means to brush it clean? It is never apart from this very place; what is\nthe use of traveling around to practice? And yet, if there is a hairsbreadth deviation, it is like the gap\nbetween heaven and earth. If the least like or dislike arises, the mind is lost in confusion.

Jinmyo Renge Osho-ajari\nDainen-ji, November 17, 2017\nEach moment unfolds as a display of richness, of colours and forms and sounds, as a myriad of\nsensations. Sincere practice is allowing the whole bodymind to live as the brightness of seeing, the depth\nof sound, as ever-changing sensations, as the Luminosity of experiencing as a whole. And when we allow\nourselves to do even a measure of this, there is a quality of questioning, of interest, of intimacy with\neverything that is being experienced. But to do this requires that we choose to stop following the\ncongealing of attention into fabrications that lead to further contraction and inevitably, suffering.\nAnzan Hoshin roshi says, in the series of classes on “The 8000 Line Prajnaparamita sutra”:\nFear is the underlying mechanism of self-image, the attempt to reify reality in the most basic kind of\nway by simply freezing it and contracting. And the conventions of consensual experience or the\nexperience of those who are unlearned, those who have not studied their experience, those who have\nnot heard the Dharma, who have not practiced it, those whose lives are based on the understanding of a\nculture which is itself founded on contraction, will allow themselves to fall into that fear and will allow\nthemselves to be held back by that fear from their own freedom.\nWhat this points to is that we must wordlessly examine absolutely everything, taking nothing for granted:\nnot who we think we are, not our memories, not what we think the body is, not what we think the mind is,\nnot what our tendencies and habits tell us to do, not what our anger or fear is telling us to do. Any state\nyou experience, any stance, any structure of attention you experience is not necessary. They are all recoil.\nThey are all self-inflicted damage.\n714\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nAs the Roshi explained in Class 4 of the series “The Development of Buddhist Psychology:\nAll conditioned existence gives rise to dukkha or unsatisfactoriness, suffering, contraction, confusion;\nthat this suffering, this dukkha, is fueled by the mechanism of grasping, of trying to hold on to something\nwhen it cannot be held and by continually misunderstanding the nature of our experience.\n“Dukkha” does not describe one particular kind of state and the \"suffering\" isn’t necessarily traumatic or\ndramatic. I mention this because sometimes students will describe a particular kind of state, such as\nboredom, as dukkha. For example, a student might describe a state of sinking mind, of disinterest, when\nwhat they really mean is boredom, and boredom is the result of stupidity klesa. In other words, boredom\nis a way of experiencing that is poisoned by a hieing of attention that you are fabricating, following,\npropagating. It is a kind of pouting that one is not being entertained. It is not as dramatic as the tantrums\nof anger or grasping. But it is still a childish tactic.\nBut dukkha refers to all states which are the result of conditioned experience, and all states create\nsuffering, unsatisfactoriness and bondage.\nThe roots of the Pali word \"dukkha\" are \"jur\" and \"kha.\" \"Bad\" and \"space\". The root metaphor behind this\nis the hole in a wheel through which the axle passes being blocked. So the word means obstructed space.\nWe need to learn that the space of who we are, which is present as seeing and hearing and just the fact of\nexperience is already open. When you are in a state, you think you have no choice about that, but the\ntruth of the matter is that you are not choosing. You are following compulsion. Choose to actually practise\nand open attention and the axle will turn freely.\nIt’s easy to cultivate states when you are sitting - states of boredom, states of calm, states of quiet, states\nof euphoria, shiny, shiny states. But all of these are dead ends because whatever is experienced within\nthe state can only be the product of the state. The context is narrowed to the kind of content that suits it.\nAnd this is why such states can seem so convincing, and so compelling. This is why you fixate on them.\nThere is no one who is better at lying to you than you are, and the thing that’s convinced by the lie is the\nsame thing that’s doing the lying. It’s not magic once you understand how the trick works. The states\ndefine who and what is imagined as a self but is really just a process of obstruction and fabrication.\nIn Zen practice, however, what we are doing is attending openly, rather than fixating. You can’t ‘fix’ a\nstate from inside of a state. You have to open around it and release it first. Anything you experience when\nattention is arranged in a structure (a state) is going to be biased and therefore cannot be true. Seeing\nthese structures and learning to attend to them more and more openly with the whole of your experience\nis part of the many truths that zazen reveals. In the Class Six Outline in the series, “The Development of\nBuddhist Psychology”, the Roshi said,The Buddha has clearly seen that the root of dukkha was clinging to\nwhat could not be clung to. This clinging was the result of conceiving of the impermanent and dynamic\nexertion of experience to be a collection of real and permanent objects and entities, believing that this\nclinging will bring pleasure and satisfaction whereas it results only in suffering and confusion, and that\nwhat is selfless and beyond the personal is self and personal. The succession of these moments of\ngrasping and confusion he called “samsara”, the “flow”. He called the cessation of this useless struggle\nand strategic approach to experience “nibbana”, the “blowing out”. In many places throughout the early\ntexts, we find the Buddha again and again asking students to give up their spiritual and secular strategies\nand just understand something so obvious that it is often missed.\n715\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nThis is why we ask students to sit according to a schedule, why the Roshi has said so often that “the\nschedule IS Buddha”. The dreaded committed sittings and the schedule you have promised to follow is\nimportant because you have to make choices that go beyond compulsion in order to do it. It is something\nin your life that will insist that you go further than your habits and tendencies dictate and can invite you\ninto the world of the Buddhas. The world of the Buddhas is unfabricated and unborn and you arrive there\nby releasing yourself into it.\nWe sit zazen and we do this practice because moment after moment, we do not understand. Any snippets\nof understanding that come and go are not enough. We cannot afford to entertain ourselves with our\nstates, our thoughts, our interpretations, our fabrications. These are all part of how we misunderstand\nand will not help us to clarify our understanding. We cannot afford to be lazy. So this morning and\nthroughout this Dharma Assembly, please make the effort to really practise the richness of colours and\nforms and sounds, the nuance of sensations. Allow the whole bodymind to live as the brightness of\nseeing, the depth of sound, as ever-changing sensations, and as the Luminosity of experiencing as a\nwhole, by opening all around, all at once.\nLabels: Anatta, Luminosity, Zen 0 comments | |\n“John Tan André, for the metta question it is not for altruistic reasons but rather to further open up oneself\ninto total exertion.\nPost anatta, one can access to the state of no mind easily and this state of no mind is \"key\" to opening up\nnew dimension of the mind where experience turn maha, immense and great.\nIf possible, it is advisable to integrate a practice, be it yoga, pranayama or qi gong or vipassana or chanting\nwhere you can focus your attention into an oceanic state of no-mind as if everything in the 10 directions\nand 3 times are all into a single action.\nDon't worry too much whether is it realistic, just don't place any limitation in the expansion in this practice.\nJust open up and connect as is presented in Hale's badly drawn diagram. ” – John Tan, 2019, Total Exertion\nand Practices\nAncestral Karma, Total Exertion\n•\nAlbert Hong For something like total exertion, contemplation really helps. You can just\nintellectually contemplate interdependence and action. Like what is doing really? We are always\ndoing. Everything is total flux. You hold that conceptually and then tune into and investigate. Then\nyou can begin to consider the conditions that go into that action. With that effort and intention\nand holding of a view, you can easily skirt into non-conceptual understanding.\n716\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nEspecially starting with a very repetitive task like washing dishes. The whole interdependent world\nis completely showcased in that activity. Hand to sponge to soap to water to dish to wiping to\ncleaning. All of it linked in it's immediacy. that keeps extending and extending until you see how\nyour father is there, your mother, your friends, the sink, the water, etc. everything is there in the\nwhole activity.\nSo you can make insane efforts, you can do A LOT and with intensity. And that is the\ninterdependent universe right there.\nYou have to think about these things. You have to apply it to your life. To your actions. The funny\nthing is that it's actually how things are. The insight is just realizing that is already the case. The\nconceptual framework just mirrors and is a door to the as it is.\n2\n•\no Like\no · Reply\no · 10h\n•\nAlbert Hong Karma is interesting to consider as well. How our personal actions reflect infinitely.\nAnd how our vision of the world at the moment is completely the result of all casual conditions\nprior.\nFor myself it is also understanding Ancestral karma that comes with the specific meat bag we carry\naround. Those energies and momentums are at play.\nBut we can also understand the same concept from lineage. We are all carriers of lineage. And we\nare the pinnacle of the lineage.\nWe also hold the lineage of being human.

But, when the discriminating awareness that’s totally decisive about the way things are mounts\nthe horse of an unwaveringly stilled and settled shamatha mind, then, destroying all focal supports of\ngrasping for extreme views with the lance of Madhyamaka logic, devoid of extremes, this wide-ranging\ndiscriminating awareness that analytically discerns, in a correct manner, expands the intelligence to\nrealize the nature of reality.\nThe ennobling, impeccable Lama has practiced like that.

Those who,\nhaving seen (it’s like this), make effort to actualize a joined pair of a stilled and settled shamatha state and\nan exceptionally perceptive vipashyana state are truly remarkable.\nThe ennobling, impeccable Lama has practiced like that.

Ānanda said: “Friends, whoever—monk or nun—declares the attainment of arahantship in my\npresence, they all do it by means of one or another of four paths.

When hearing sound, like the sound of flowing water and\nchirping bird, it is as if you are there. It should be non-conceptual, no sense of body or me, transparent,\nas if the sensations stand out.

Many wrongly\nconclude that because there is no-self, there is nothing to do and nothing to practice. This is precisely\nusing \"self view\" to understand \"anatta\" despite having the insight.\nIt does not mean because there is no-self, there is nothing to practice; rather it is because there is no self,\nthere is only ignorance and the chain of afflicted activities. Practice therefore is about overcoming\nignorance and these chain of afflictive activities. There is no agent but there is attention. Therefore\npractice is about wisdom, vipassana, mindfulness and concentration. If there is no mastery over these\npractices, there is no liberation. So one should not bullshit and psycho ourselves into the wrong path of\nno-practice and waste the invaluable insight of anatta. That said, there is the passive mode of practice of\nchoiceless awareness, but one should not misunderstand it as the \"default way\" and such practice can\nhardly be considered \"mastery\" of anything, much less liberation.\"” – Soh, 2020\n“One Pointedness\nThag 1:49 Rāmaṇeyyaka\nNavigationSuttas/KN/Thag/1:49\nEven with all the whistles & whistling,\nthe calls of the birds,\nthis, my mind, doesn’t waver,\nfor my delight is in\noneness.\n.............\nThere are those that are mistaken about one-pointedness, they think after an advanced realization the\npractice of one-pointedness or shamatha becomes redundant or even harmful, as if one pointedness\nimplies a dualistic state.

Question about samadhi)\nJohn: actually what is more important is that background is completely gone. Then when the background\nis completely gone, you do not have a behind, only the sound. Then your experience becomes most direct,\ncannot be more direct. Then when you hear the basketball sound, bum bum bum.. only. You understand\nwhat I mean? Initially even if you have seen through, there will always be a tendency – you and the\nbasketball. I ever went through a period where I thought that I will not have that problem anymore. After\nabout three months later, it comes back. Then I wondered why does it come back after I have seen through?\nThen after that, the tendency (comes back?). for yours (me/Soh) it is quite clear, because lucid dream until\none can control the three states, it is quite deep already. After the initial insight one needs 4-5 years to have\nthat kind of calibre, you see? So some people are different. So it is sufficiently deep into the mind body\ntendency. For me, three months after (?) it has a dual sensation, then after still a period (?) after.\nJui: I always hear people say when you see one object you are like the object… but in my experience…\n725\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\nJohn: In your experience now, your self at the behind will be gone. But you are unable to reach completely\nmind to object (one pointedness). But your behind disappears. But to zhuan zhu yi ge (be absorbed in one\n[object]) you are unable to reach, that requires Samadhi state. That is, that behind is gone, but you are one\npointed into one object, then with view you will experience maha experience, total exertion. He (me/Soh)\nis also the same, the behind is gone, no more self, only the sound but there is no self, there is just this,\nthere is just that. That is because the insight has arisen but concentration (?) my way is different. Before\ninsight of anatta I had decades of practicing meditation, then I AM, then meditation, then I AM. My practice\nis like that. (?) but for you guys, you see clearly first, the behind is gone and your experience becomes very\nclear and vivid and yet you are unable to concentrate. So you must understand that concentration is\ndifferent. Peacefulness and releasing is (different), clear vivid awareness is also different. It requires\ndifferent insights and practice. You still have to meditate, it is impossible that (?) you should be in this stage,\nyou are very clear, the click click sound is felt to be very vivid, then one day you will have total exertion\nfeeling, but you must practice releasing and concentration. When the mind is discursive and wandering,\nyou need practice. your mindfulness/thought needs to be practiced. You need to have a stillness/Samadhi.\n(to me/Soh) Your stillness is still not enough. Your mind is still having thought after thought, you are unable\nto have stillness. But your insight is able to reach no self. You are still unable to reach stillness and releasing.\nIt is not a matter of saying then you can reach it, it requires practice.\n(Comments by Soh: before my realization of anatta I would do samatha and enter into jhanic bliss [samadhi\nbliss but not resting in nature of mind], afterwards it is more towards the bliss of no-self luminosity, yet\nsamadhi is still vital)\nMe: best way is to practice vipasssana?\nJohn: Vipassana … when it becomes non conceptual and non dual, it is even more difficult like for you, your\ninsight is there, there is no self, yet when you sit you are unable to reach it. Because you need to focus. You\nneed to focus your breath, (otherwise?) unable to reach it. For normal people they are able to reach it even\neasier. For you it is somewhat more difficult. So I always tell you, for example, for you and him the way of\nentering is by clear luminosity… feel as clear as possible. For example when you breathe, feel your breathe\nentirely. So you feel very very clear, just this breath you know. Then you feel the vividness. It is easier to\nenter this way.\nMe: so you are advising Anapanasati?\nJohn: yes of course, then you do many times. But when you do many times you are not counting. Don’t\ncount. Just feel the entire sensation of the breath. You are just that sensation of your breath. Then you are\nso clear with your entire breath. That whole aircon that touches your nostrils, then going into your lungs. It\nis just this sensation. This is what we call breath. So you keep on doing. You are very aware of it. Actually it\nis not you are very aware of lah. This is what I call awareness and the whole thing is awareness, there is no\nsomebody awaring. It is just breath. Then slowly you will have this (Samadhi?), you need to keep doing.”\n726\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“Total exertion is shamatha and vipassana into one.

This\ncomplete emptiness of any kind of identity and clinging or subject-object relation in relation to 'in the\nseen just the seen', 'in the heard just the heard' is true dispassion.\nA dissociated state is just another form of grasping, attachment.

Yes, you can experience anatta even when there are wandering thoughts\nbecause it is always already so, but one can never fully appreciate the Presence, total life, intelligence and\nawareness... it is a whole different level.\nIn other words: thoughts are ok, but you must have 'mastery' over them. Means unnecessary thoughts do\nnot arise.” - Soh, 2015\nA conversation with John Tan in 2007:\n“John: Anyway I read a lot talking about you [can] have a lot of thoughts during meditation and you are\ndoing correctly. That is pure nonsense. Lack of practice and misunderstanding. Cannot be taken to mean\na form of achievement. There are thoughts, but thoughts are reduced tremendously and there is this\nclear insight of their spontaneity. means like what [Sixth Ch’an/Zen Patriarch] Hui-Neng said [about]\nthoughtlessness, but it arises due to the presence of conditions, not from attachments. When there is\nattachments, there are a lot of thoughts, and these thoughts are dualistic in nature. thought must reduce\ntremendously for clarity to arise. The nakedness aspect, the crystal clarity aspect. This is because of\nhabitual propensities in action.\nWhen one has some experience but is unable to understand the transcendental experience but due to\nthe lack of practice is unable to touch the most essential and fundamental of our nature. So in the mind,\nthere is this constant contemplation using thoughts to articulate things to understand, to know. But it is\nhardly anywhere near to crystal clarity. First thing ask oneself, are there symbols attached to experience?\nAre there any meanings attached to these symbols? If what is felt and understood are the meaning of the\nsymbols, then there is a waste of time. In meditation, it is the nakedness, the qualities of our luminosity\nthat is experienced. like clarity, spontaneity, blissfulness, realness, energy… nothing to do with symbols,\nmeaning, purpose… etc”\n2006:\n(7:52 PM) John: she doesn't consider ET to be spiritual teachers\n(7:53 PM) John: but spiritual master\n(7:53 PM) John:\n(7:53 PM) AEN: oic..\n(7:53 PM) John: like comparable to buddha and jesus.\n(7:53 PM) John: self realisation without ego.\n(7:53 PM) John:\n(7:53 PM) AEN: hahaha\n(7:53 PM) AEN: oic\n(7:54 PM) John: self realisation is not just so and there are many levels.\n(7:54 PM) John: it is just the beginning\n730\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(7:54 PM) John: the portals are especially important\n(7:54 PM) AEN: icic\n(7:54 PM) AEN: those inner body meditation, breathing meditation all those stuff taught by eckhart you\nmean?\n(7:54 PM) John: one must go beyond symbols for the strength of clarity to surface\n(7:55 PM) John: yes but the key is to go beyond names and labels and touch our pristine awareness\n(7:55 PM) John: and experience reality as it is....gradually the bond will loosen and subsides\n(7:56 PM) John: and the clarity, vitality and intelligence of our nature will take over.\n(7:56 PM) AEN: icic..\n(7:56 PM) John: before that, practice hard to go beyond our conceptual mind\n(7:56 PM) AEN: oic\n(7:56 PM) John: with the tranquil calmness that i said.\n(7:56 PM) AEN: icic\n(7:57 PM) John: then it becomes sustainable and must be at least for 30 mins before we begin to\nexperience the clarity and vitality\n(7:57 PM) AEN: oic..\n(7:57 PM) John: not 30 mins of meditation\n(7:58 PM) AEN: ya was wondering wat you mean\n(7:58 PM) AEN: haha\n(7:58 PM) John: 30 mins at least of thoughtlessness in meditation for the clarity and vitality to surface.\n(7:58 PM) AEN: ya even my teacher say usually for beginner it takes at least 30 minutes of meditation\n(7:58 PM) John: means ability to see in 'raw'\n(7:58 PM) AEN: so should meditate at least 30 minutes\n(7:58 PM) John: no not 30 mins of meditation\n(7:59 PM) AEN: oh you mean just thoughtlessness anywhere?\n(7:59 PM) John: by at least 30 so mins to maintain the gap between 2 moment of thoughts\n(7:59 PM) John: one must put effort into mastering this\n(7:59 PM) AEN: oh so you mean at least 30 mins of gap is needed before one can experience clarity and\nvitality?\n(7:59 PM) AEN: wah..\n(8:00 PM) John: through letting go until a tranquil calmness arises, b4 that, we would be able to have\nability to enter into our natural state.\n(8:00 PM) John: yes\n(8:00 PM) John: it is a different type of experience.\n(8:00 PM) AEN: what is different type of experience?\n(8:01 PM) John: one must be able to break the bond of conceptual thought first.\n(8:01 PM) John: then the clarity and vitality aspect can arise\n(8:01 PM) John: then you can begin to understand more.\n(8:02 PM) John: the realisation will help us in the understanding\n(8:02 PM) John: without the realisation, it becomes a stage of achievement.\n731\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n(8:02 PM) AEN: oic\n(8:05 PM) John: i have stressed so many times about the bond and the power of it, but few people can\nreally understand what i meant...ai...\n(8:05 PM) AEN: icic..\n(8:06 PM) John: you must learn how to meditate and practice mindfulness till you are able to go pre-\nsymbolic\n(8:06 PM) AEN: oic..\n(8:07 PM) John: the actual experience is most important\n“John: stilling the body and mind only result in a deep and stable calmness that gather strength. for the\nother quality to arise, it needs the direct experience and intuitive wisdom\nJohn: the letting go is to settle the mind till he is about to have mastery over the thought patterns.

And one might suffer\nbecause we do not know how to deal with these experience.” - John Tan, 2006\n“In my opinion many of our great aspirations and high views turn empty talks easily.\nAfter the direct insight of anatta, it opens the gate that allows one to experience effortlessly all sensations\nthat arise without duality, without fear, without doership and without ownership. Many are unable to see\nthe \"whys and \"how\" of \"directness\", so don't waste your insights that have given the opportunity in this\nlife.\nTrain yourself to do that with sincerity and dedication first. Then you will be fully in touch with your\noriginal purity; you will be genuinely in touch with peace and openness.\"\nMore later:\n\"If we want to experience fully and have genuine peace, be very sincere in sensing all your sensations for\npretense, blames, rejections and contractions... ...don't rush... slow down your thoughts and scan all your\nsensations for these... see all these traces... see all these come from the \"I\"s and \"mine\"s... develop a\nstrong willingness to let go with your insights of anatta. If you can for a brief moment be free from the\nconceit of I, the craving of mine and the background of I AM, that moment you are respectable even to\nthe gods.\nI do not want you to get into too high views and lose touch with genuine and simple practice.\"\nJohn Tan wrote in 2007,\n732\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n“(5:29 PM) John: what are the 3 characteristics (of self-liberation)?\n(5:29 PM) Soh: impermanence, suffering, no self ?\n(5:29 PM) John: nope, I just told you the other day. Completely non-dual and transparent. Completely\nfearless. Completely non-attached. So if a person after the experience of no-self, and is able to attain this\n3 characteristics, then his hui geng (wisdom root) is truly deep. da geng qi (superior capacity). means the\nenlightenment of non-dual of our nature leads directly to self liberation. that is because the 'sense of self'\nis completely eliminated from 7th [consciousness] and karmic propensities become self liberated. Even\nafter initial realization of anatta, we have to continue practicing and meditating until these three aspects\nare perfected.”\n“One Action Samadhi (一行三昧)\nThose who regard the mundane as a hindrance to life and practice only understand that in the mundane\nnothing is sacred; what they have not yet understood is that in sacredness nothing is mundane.\n— Dōgen, Genjokoan\nAs a Soto Zen teacher said (too lazy to find his exact quote, but it goes something like this) - I am not\ndevaluing the status of the precious jewel to the ordinary, I am elevating the status of the ordinary to the\nstatus of the precious jewel.\nBut this requires realisation of anatta. Prior to that, pure presence seems special and transcendent,\nmetaphysical (spaceless and timeless) and exists outside the realm of the mundane and ordinary. The\nmundane and ordinary seems dry and barren, devoid of “spirit” or “presence” and is merely a distraction.\nAfter I AM realization at the age of 17, John Tan always entered nirvikalpa samadhi and was very much\ninspired to renounce as a monk and follow the footsteps of Ramana Maharshi in Arunachala. As he said,\nat that time any attention to the outer world of the five senses seemed like a distraction from the\ntranscendent bliss of pure Being, which is Presence tasted only in the Mind door and not yet realised in\nthe other senses. He only did not renounce due to strong family resistance.\nThe way of Anatta is different. The taste of I AMness is similar but now tasted in every single myriad\ndharmas, the ten thousand things. Furthermore, anything short of the total exertion of a single dharma\nand activity even in each mundane and ordinary activity like chop wood and carry water, fully engaged\nand involved as “being-time”, where satori and samadhi (一行三昧) is fully actualized in the daily activities\nof eating, drinking, shitting and sleeping, anything less than that is not considered zen enlightenment.\nStill, we diligently sit in zazen, and practice goes on endlessly according to Dogen. I like Soto Zen for their\ndedication to zazen and enjoy sitting with them for hours each time back in Australia. I do not have access\nto Soto Zen in Singapore but I enjoy meditating in parks.”\n733\nSTAGE 5: No Mirror Reflecting (“Anatta / No-Self / Firstfold Emptiness”)\n~ Mantra\n“[24/3/19, 11:39:05 PM] John Tan: Next time I teach you to do simple breathing and use sound vibration to\nexpand your consciousness.

What is\nthat one quality? Young man, it is when the bodhisattva mahāsattvas know the nature of all phenomena.\n“Young man, how do bodhisattva mahāsattvas know the nature of all phenomena? Young man,\nbodhisattva mahāsattvas know that all phenomena are nameless; they have no names. They know that all\nphenomena have no vocalization, they have no expression in speech, they have no letters, they have no\nbirth, they have no cessation, they have no characteristics of cause, they have no characteristics of\nconditions, they are devoid of characteristics, they have the one characteristic of having no\ncharacteristics, they are devoid of attributes, they cannot be conceived of, they have no thought, and\nthey have no mentality.”\n“The absence of characteristics [alakṣaṇa] is a synonym for emptiness [śūnyatā].\n739\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nIn short, we believe we are a self that possesses characteristics, or that objects are discrete entities that\npossess characteristics. In realizing emptiness however, it is recognized non-conceptually and\nexperientially that there is no object or self that possesses characteristics, and without the inherent object\nto possess characteristics, characteristics cease to be characteristics.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\n“Thoughts (and whatever else that appears in one’s experience) are neither arising and ceasing, nor non-\narising and non-ceasing… ...Whatever manifests (dharma/appearances/phenomena/pure sensory\nexperiences) is directly realized to be non-arising because of dependent origination.” - John Tan, 2014\n“Emptiness and non-arising must also strongly trigger us that we have completely MISTAKEN! About\nwhat? About all experiential phenomena thought to be originated, abided and ceased are actually not so\nby the prajna realization of non-arising and emptiness. It is a specific realization of dependent arising\nbecause one realizes that whatever arises in dependence does not truly arise, abide or cease. When I\nasked you where is the scenery, where is this arising sound when in Anatta and non-dual mode? What do\nyou think is the purpose?” – John Tan, 2015\n“I pay respect to the best among speakers who, having attained Enlightenment, has taught relative\norigination (Pratītyasamutpāda) which is no-cessation, no-origination, no- annihilation, no-abiding, no-\none-thing, no-many-thing, no-coming-in, no-going-out; being the termination of linguistic description\n(Prapañcopashamam), it is the good (Shivam)” - Nagarjuna [Ram Candra Pandey & Mañju, 1999, pp.1].\n\"The perfectly enlightened buddhas-proclaimed, 'What is dependently created is uncreated.'\"\n- Candrakīrti\n\"Whatever is dependently originated does not truly arise.\"\n- Mañjuśrī\n\"What originates dependently is unoriginated!\"\n- Nāgārjuna\n\"That phenomena are born from causes can never be inconsistent [with facts]; since the cause is empty of\ncause, we understand it to be empty of origination.

For\nexample:\nWhat appears is neither \"internal\" nor \"external\". For the notion of \"internality\" is dependent on the\nnotion of \"externality\", without either, the sense of neither can arise.\nDo not just let our contemplation remain at this level. If we do that, at most the freedom will simply\nremain at the mental level -- merely a pellucid, pure and clean state. It is no different from practicing raw\nattention although insight on how conceptualities proliferate the mind may arise.\nBut go further to relate directly to our sensations, thoughts, smells, colors, tastes, sounds and ask:\n\"What do we mean by thoughts are neither inside nor outside our head?\"\nSeeing through this will be much more penetrating. It will bring a deep sense of illusoriness and mystical\nawe as a real-time lived-experience into our entire body mind.” – John Tan, 2022\n“The weight of thoughts -- Part 2\nHow heavy are thoughts?\nWhere are their roots?\nIt is not uncommon to hear in the spiritual circle phrases like \"the 'I' is just a thought\" or \"thought is\nempty and spacious, there is no weight or root to it\".\nWhile the rootlessness and the space-like nature of \"thoughts\" should be pointed out, one must not be\nmisled into thinking they have seen through \"anything\" much less up-rooted the deeply seated\nconceptual notions of \"I/mine\", \"body/mind\", \"space/time\"...etc.\nSo emphasis must also be placed on the other side of the coin. \"Thoughts\" are astonishingly heavy like a\nblack-hole (size of a pinhole, weight of a star); the roots of conceptual notions\" they carry permeate our\nentire being and everywhere.\nThe \"roots\" of thoughts are no where to be found also means they can be found anywhere and\neverywhere, spreaded across the 3 times and 10 directions -- in modern context, over different time-lines\nacross the multiverse. In other words, \"this arises, that arises\".”\n741\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nJohn Tan said to someone years ago, \"Jhanas imo is needed for a start, when the mind is unstable and\nwhen concentration isn't strong, it is not easy to see through reification.\nPost anatta, practice should be spacious and natural, open and free. Once we recognize the nature of\nwhat appears is empty and non-arisen, primordially pure and free from all elaborations, we must mature\nand stabilize these 2 insights. Gradually, our entire body-mind will be transformed into an oceanic\nsamadhi of rainbow and mirage like spaciousness, not just simply non-dual and transparent vivid\nradiance.\"\n“Jamgon Mipham:\nAccordingly, in the case of a beginner, it is possible for mere nonexistence (med rkyang tsam), the\nnegation of truly existent phenomena, to arise as a mental object. But a person whose Madhyamaka\ninvestigation has hit the mark will perfectly distinguish the difference between the lack of inherent\nexistence and mere nonexistence; and will be quite certain that a phenomenon's lack of inherent\nexistence is inseparable from its dependent arising. Such an extraordinary mode of apprehension\nindeed acts as an antidote to the precipitous extremes of both substantialism and nihilism. For as long as,\naccording to one's mode of apprehension, one is either refuting things or establishing them, one is not\nactually in the nature beyond all conceptual extremes. When, with reasoned analysis, one arrives at the\ncertainty that phenomena do not dwell in any of the four extremes, and when one settles evenly in the\ndharmadhatu, by way of the self-cognizing primordial wisdom, this will have the power to dispel all\nconceptual constructs. Thus one will gain confidence in ultimate reality, in 'which there are no\nmisconceptions to dispel and no progress to make. One will have confidence in the genuine meaning of\n\"freedom from mental activity\" as explained in the Prajnaparamita-sutra.”\nThose who realize that all entities are dependently arisen and,\nJust like a moon that appears in a pool of water,\nAre neither true nor false,\nAre not carried away by philosophical dogmas.\n~ Nagarjuna, in Sixty Verses on Reasoning\n“In reality there is neither form nor seer, neither sound nor hearer; there is neither smell, nor one who\nsmells, neither taste nor taster; neither touch nor one who touches, neither thought nor thinker.” –\nHevajratantra\nDzogchen text Unwritten Tantra as translated by Acarya Malcolm (see: Clarifications on Dharmakaya and\nBasis by Loppön Namdrol/Malcolm www.awakeningtoreality.com/2014/02/clarifications-on-dharmakaya-\nand-basis_16.html ):\n'Apparent yet non-existent retinue, listen well! There is no object to distinguish in me, the view of self-\noriginated wisdom; it did not exist before, it will not arise later, and also does not appear in anyway in the\n742\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\npresent. The path does not exist, action does not exist, traces do not exist, ignorance does not exist,\nthoughts do not exist, mind does not exist, prajñā does not exist, samsara does not exist, nirvana does\nnot exist, vidyā itself does not even exist, totally not appearing in anyway.'\nMalcolm:\nMalcolm wrote many years ago:\n“...At base, the main fetter of self-grasping is predicated upon naive refication of existence and non-\nexistence. Dependent origination is what allows us to see into the non-arising nature of dependently\noriginated phenomena, i.e. the self-nature of our aggregates. Thus, right view is the direct seeing, in\nmeditative equipoise, of this this non-arising nature of all phenomena. As such, it is not a \"view\" in the\nsense that is something we hold as concept, it is rather a wisdom which \"flows\" into our post-equipoise\nand causes us to truly perceive the world in the following way in Nagarjuna's Bodhicittavivarana:\n\"Form is similar to a foam,\nFeeling is like water bubbles,\nIdeation is equivalent with a mirage,\nFormations are similar with a banana tree,\nConsciousness is like an illusion.\"”\n….\n“People like to believe the ultimate is something, even if that something is inexpressible. Since in\nBuddhadharma there is no ultimate apart from the relative, emptiness is only hard to understand for\nthose who wish there to be some permanent, ultimate something which is not dependently originated.\nAwakening in Buddhadharma comes from understanding the ultimate nature (emptiness) of relative\nphenomena (dependent origination).

Mañjuśrī, a large mass of water is generated by the wind, and then it falls from the atmosphere\nabove.

Therefore, he was given the name\nTathāgata among gods and men. [44] Mañjuśrī, this word appears among gods and men: Tathāgata.\nHowever, Mañjuśrī, there is no Tathāgata to be found. The Tathāgata, Mañjuśrī, is not a sign, and he is\nfree from signs. [F.283.a] He is not placed in any of the primary or intermediate directions. He is unreal,\nnon-arisen, and non-ceasing.\n“On the other hand, Mañjuśrī, the appearance of the Tathāgata satisfies and entertains this world,\nincluding the gods, through the Dharma. And then, due to the ripening of previous karma of beginner\nbodhisattvas and immature, ordinary people who are guided by means of nirvāṇa, it appears that the\nTathāgata is no more to be seen.

Pais\nI'm reminded of Stian's \"knock-sound\" experiment. Knocking on the table, sound appears: but where is\nit?\nIs it in the fingers? In the wood? In the air? In the eardrum or the mind? Is it in the space\naccommodating all this? In the temporal series expressing this activity?\nSound is nowhere to be found, and yet it is vividly present. It lies not in any of the individual conditions,\nbut if a single one of them is removed, sound does not manifest. It arises from nothing in specific, and yet\nit exists inseparable from all. Ultimately, the whole universe is embodied in this knock-sound movement,\nbut in the whole universe never is it found.\nIt's like the fresh-looking water in a mirage. It is so obviously there - a tired wanderer will spend his last\nsliver of energy dragging his hurt feet over burning sand to taste that deliciously-looking water. And yet,\nthere is not one atom's worth of water in the mirage.\nThe absolute absence of water is perfectly aligned with and inseparable from the appearance of fresh\nand vibrant water. The emptiness of water is none other than the form of water.\nSound is like the water in a mirage. It is as gloriously present as it is unfathomably absent. It is the\nentire field of causes and conditions, stretching all space and time, and yet magically abiding and resting\nnowhere.\nAll causes and conditions are like this. All effects. All reality - space, time, self, other, mind, matter,\nworld. All is gloriously present, vibrant and poignant; all is mysteriously absent, unfindable and\nungraspable.\nStian Gudmundsen Høiland\n747\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n....\nYin Ling\n·\nDependent arising and non-arising.\n.. Is a most important concept in Buddhism to understand. The nature of all “things” or mind can be\nunderstood only when we understand non-arising.\nMost when explain dependent origination, or dependent arising, explain the contributions of causes and\nconditions, parts, towards the EXISTENCE of a whole, towards the existence of an inherent event. They\nstill see the whole car , they still see the whole person, with an essence, with a core. That is still not\ngood enough.\nThis is just the very start and basic teaching of understanding causes and conditions, but not yet the true\nintent of the Blessed one.\nThis way of seeing essence / existence also reflects the deep grasping of our mind on Inherency, our\nminds always to want to pin something down, have something to wrap around, to solidify. Can you feel\nthat tendency? The propensity of wanting to see the existence of a whole is so hypnotising… so much so\nthat we are not able to be freed of the root that propels our cyclic existence - the grasping mind onto\nInherency- that is the root.\nAlso, Understanding dependent arising this way, we will not be able to transcend birth and death. We\nwon’t be able to explain rebirth clearly. There will be contradictions in our thought process.\nHowever, if one understands when a thing is dependent on causes and conditions, on parts, on the\nconsciousness that apprehends and conceptualises it, when that “thing” is shred to pieces like that, there\nis no one true thing there\nwith an ESSENCE, there is no true arising.\nThere is only a coreless appearance.\nLike a hologram.\nNo essence. Nothing to grasp.\nThis is what is meant by “non-arising”.\nIt is the true meaning of dependent origination.\nIt is emptiness.\nThere is Not an inherent thing, not an inherent process, not an inherent mind, not an inherent world,\nnothing inherent, only dependent arising.\nWhen we see clearly like that, our mind has nothing to wrap around, our mind cannot pin something\ndown..\nWhen asked, where is the car? The mind is stunted by this question because if it looks, it cannot pin “CAR”\nin its part, in the people who make the car, or even in the consciousness that apprehend it. Where is the\ncar?\nUnderstanding dependent arising or dependent origination this way,\nfrom there we can see non-arising,\nHence non-abiding\n748\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAnd non-cessation.\nWhat is there to arise, abide or cease?\nThen one can understand the heart sutra’s intent of “all dharmas are empty, there is no birth, no\ndeath, no stain, no stainlessness, no increase, no decrease”. （是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不\n减）\nYou will also understand why the 6th patriarch Hui Neng in his reply poem says :\n”There is nothing truly there,\nWhere can dust alight?”\n(本来无一物，何处惹尘埃）\nYou will be able to understand Nargajuna 8 negations dedicatory verses to the Buddha in his\nmonumental “Fundamental wisdom of the middle way”:\nI prostrate to the Perfect Buddha,\nThe best of teachers,\nwho taught that\nWhatever is dependently arisen is\nUnceasing, unborn,\nUnannihilated, not permanent,\nNot coming, not going,\nWithout distinction, without identity,\nAnd free from conceptual construction.\nThen you can understand Tsongkhapa’s 3 principle of the path , his saying about one’s analysis is only\ncomplete after one sees both dependent origination and emptiness as complementary and not separate.\nThen there is no separate 2 truths.\nAnd we understand nature of reality. Just that.\nAnd you will eventually with repetitive seeing sees nirvana, unleash the mind from many lifetimes of\ngrasping to true existence , and stop suffering so much\nMay all sincere practitioners be able to see clearly with wisdom and liberate.\n“Non-arisen means although there is vivid display, the appearances cannot be found anywhere. Like an\noptical illusion that appears does not truly exist cannot be said to have originated -- it was never there in\nthe first place. All dependent originated are like that.” – John Tan, 2020\nAlthough the emptiness of all phenomena (as opposed to emptiness of merely persons and subjective\nself/soul/agent) is emphasized in Mahayana Buddhism, I can assure you that it is also taught in the Pali\ncanon.\n“Pali Canon Verses on the Emptiness of All Phenomena (Dharmas)\nKaccayanagotta Sutta is a discourse on Right View and the Middle Way.

The Buddha states clearly in the Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta SN 22.95:\nForm is like a lump of foam; feeling is like a bubble; perception seems like a mirage; choices like a banana tree;\nand consciousness like a magic trick: so taught the Kinsman of the Sun. However you contemplate them,\nexamining them carefully, they’re void and hollow when you look at them closely. Concerning this body, he of\nvast wisdom has taught that when three things are given up, you’ll see this form discarded. Vitality, warmth, and\nconsciousness: when they leave the body, it lies there tossed aside, food for others, mindless. Such is this\nprocess, this illusion, cooed over by fools. It’s said to be a killer, for no substance is found here.\nAnd Udānavarga 2.18:\nHe who has perceived that this body is (empty) as a vase, and who knows that all things (dharma) are as an\nillusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death. He who\nhas perceived that this world is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy the\nchief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death. He who has perceived that this body is\nlike froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and\nwill no more be seen by the king of death.\nAnd SA 265:\nMonks, it is just as if a master magician or the disciple of a master magician at a crossroads creates the magical\nillusion of an elephant troop, a horse troop, a chariot troop, and an infantry troop, and a clear-sighted person\ncarefully examines, attends to, and analyses it. At the time of carefully examining, attending to, and analysing it,\nhe finds that there is nothing in it, nothing stable, nothing substantial, it has no solidity. Why is that? It is\nbecause there is nothing solid or substantial in a magical illusion.\nAnd then obviously Śākyamuni is even more liberal with the use of “illusion” in describing the nature of\nphenomena in the prajñāpāramitā and the Vajrayāna tantras, namely the Guhyasamāja and Kalācākra\nwhich are his teachings.\n6\n750\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nLabels: Buddha, Emptiness, Theravada 0 comments | | ”\n“\n-->Apart from what is compounded—utterly unrelated to it—how can the uncompounded be discerned?

But what is crucial in this analogy is how the \"chariot\" is understood.\nIt can be from non-gelug perspective or the gelug perspective.\nFor the non-gelug, it is understood simply as a designation mistaken as \"real\" and we should eliminate all\nconceptualities into freedom from all elaborations, i.e, recognize the primordial purity, ka dag of\nphenomena. In this case reified constructs are treated more like non-existence instead of non-arisen.\nThen there is a need to point to the unfailing appearances and emphasized the union of emptiness and\nappearances. So there are 3 vital steps and insights:\n1. Recognizing the primordial purity - ka dag (emptiness)\n2. Realize that appearances unfailingly appears despite thorough negation (non-implicative)\n3. Union of 1 emptiness + 2 appearances. Mipham coined it as \"coalescence\".\nFor the gelug, chariot is non-arisen instead of non-existence. They see the purpose of analysing the\n\"chariot\" with the 7 fold reasoning is to understand the dream-like nature of phenomena/appearances\nare like the designation of chariot.

For an\nobject to inherently exist it must exist outright, independent of causes and conditions, independent of\nattributes, characteristics and constituent parts. However, we cannot find an inherent object independent\nof these factors, and the implications of this fact is that we likewise cannot find an inherent object within\nthose factors either.\nThe object itself, as the core entity which possesses characteristics, is ultimately unfindable. We instead\nonly find a designated collection of pieces, which do not in fact create any discrete object. In the absence\nof an object the pieces are likewise rendered as incapable of being \"pieces\" or \"parts\" and therefore they\nare also nothing more than arbitrary designations that amount to nothing more than inferences.\nThis means that all entities, selves, and so on are merely useful conventional designations, their\nprovisional validity is only measured by their efficacy, and apart from that conventional imputation, there\nis no underlying object that can be ascertained or found.\nDependent origination is the apparent origination of entities that seem to manifest in dependence on\ncauses and conditions. But as Nāgārjuna states above, those causes and conditions are actually the\nignorance which afflicts the mindstream, and the conditions of grasping, mine-making and I-making\nwhich are the drivers of karmic activity that serve to reify the delusion of a self, or a self in objects, and so\non.\nThis is why many adepts are explicitly clear that dependent origination is synonymous with a lack of\norigination [anutpāda], because phenomena that originate in dependence on ignorance as a cause, never\nactually originate at all, for example, Candrakīrti states:\nThe perfectly awakened buddhas proclaimed, \"What is dependently originated is non-arisen.”\nOr Mañjuśrī:\nWhatever is dependently originated does not truly arise.\nNāgārjuna once again:\nWhat originates dependently is non-arisen!\nThus dependent origination is incapable of producing existence of any sort, because dependent\norigination is incapable of producing entities. Entities and existence only appear because of the ignorance\n754\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nwhich afflicts your mind. When that ignorance is removed, all perceptions of existence are removed, all\nperceptions of selves are removed and all perceptions of origination are removed.\n• John Tan shared something I posted on AtR by Kyle Dixon:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../kyle-dixon-on...\nKyle dixon:\nThe middle way is actually a freedom from the misconceptions of existence and non-existence. Holding\nthat things exist (whether they are conditioned or unconditoned phenomena) is eternalism, holding that\nthings do not exist (whether they are conditioned or unconditioned) is nihilism. Annihilationism is the\nbelief that something existent becomes non-existent.\nThe way to avoid these various extremes is emptiness, which means (i) a lack of inherent existence, (ii) a\nfreedom from extremes, (iii) a lack of arising [non-arising], (iv) dependent co-origination. All of those\ndefinitions being synonymous.\nDependent origination is the proper relative view which leads one to the realization of the ultimate view;\nwhich is emptiness. Many people misunderstand emptiness to be a negative view, but it is actually the\nproper middle way view which avoids the extremes of existence, non-existence, both and neither.\nAll in all there is really no way to ELI5 with this topic, you'll just have to ask questions. It is simple once\nunderstood, but very, very few people actually understand dependent origination.\nHere is a collection of stuff I wrote awhile ago on dependent origination for the sake of the discussion:\nthe general definition of independent origination, the very idea that things are endowed with their own-\nbeing/essence [svabhāva], or self [ātman]. In order for something to be independently originated it would\nhave to be unconditioned, independent and uncaused, but this is considered an impossibility in the eyes\nof Buddhism. The correct conventional view for emptiness is that of dependent origination, and so we see\nthat in order to have objects, persons, places, things and so on, they must possessed of causes and\nconditions. Meaning they cannot be found apart from those causes and conditions. If the conditions are\nremoved, the object does not remain.\nThe adepts of the past have said that since a thing only arises due to causes, and abides due to\nconditions, and fails in the absence of cause and condition, how can this thing be said to exist? For an\nobject to inherently exist it must exist outright, independent of causes and conditions, independent of\nattributes, characteristics and constituent parts. However we cannot find an inherent object independent\nof these factors, and the implications of this fact is that we likewise cannot find an inherent object within\nthose factors either. The object 'itself' is unfindable. We instead only find a designated collection of\npieces, which do not in fact create anything apart from themselves, and even then, the parts are also\narbitrary designations as well, for if there is no inherently existent object, there can be no inherent parts,\ncharacteristics or attributes either. Therefore the object is merely a useful conventional designation, and\n755\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nits validity is measured by its efficacy, apart from that conventional title however, there is no underlying\ninherent object to be found.\nDependent origination is pointing to a species of implied interdependency; the fact that an allegedly\nconditioned 'thing' only arises via implication from the misperception of other conditioned things, and so\neach 'thing' is simultaneously a cause and an effect of each other, and everything else. Dependent\norigination isn't a case in which we have truly established things which are existing in dependence on\nother truly existent things, for instance; that we have objects which are truly constructed of parts which\nare in turn made of smaller parts such as atoms etc. This is of course one way of looking at dependent\norigination, but this would be considered a very coarse and realist/essentialist view. One that subtly\npromotes a sense of own-being or essence to things. So instead what dependent origination is pointing\nout, is that there is no inherent object to be found apart from (or within) the varying conventional\ncharacteristics we attribute to said object. On the other hand there would also be no inherent objects\nfound in relation to (or within a relationship) with the various characteristics attributed to said objects. For\neach would only be valid when contrasted with the other, and upon discovering a lack of inherency in\nregards to one, the validity of the other would be compromised as well. Our experiences are merely\ninterdependent conventional constructs composed of unfounded inferences.\nIn this way, the object 'itself', as an essential core 'thing' is unfindable. We instead only find a designated\ncollection of pieces, which do not in fact create anything apart from themselves, and even then, the parts\nare also arbitrary designations as well, for if there is no inherently existent object, there can be no\ninherent parts, characteristics or attributes either.\nSo for example, if a table were truly inherently existent, meaning it exists independently, then we would\nbe able to find that table independently of its varying characteristics. The table would be able to exist\nindependently of being observed, independent of its color or texture, independent of its parts and pieces,\nindependent of its designated name, independent of its surroundings etc. In contrast, if observation - or\nconsciousness for example - were truly existent, we would likewise be able to find it apart from the\nperception of the table, surrounding environment, and so on. There is no essential, 'core' nature that a\ntable in fact 'is' or possesses, and the same goes for consciousness and anything else.\nFor sentient beings afflicted with ignorance, conceptual imputation and conventional language are\nmistaken as pointing towards authentic persons, places, things, etc. When ignorance is undone, there is\nfreedom to use conventional language, however it doesn't create confusion because wisdom directly\nknows ignorance for what it is. In Buddhism conventionality is allowed to be a tool implemented for\ncommunication, so we're allowed to be John Doe or Mary Smith, trees, rocks, cars are allowed to be\ndesignations. Conventionality is simply a useful tool which doesn't point to anything outside of itself. The\nconventional truth is relative... words, concepts, ideas, persons, places, things etc., and is contrasted by\nultimate truth, which is emptiness.\nAll apparent phenomena which fall under the category of 'conditioned' - meaning they accord with one or\nmore of the four extremes (existence, nonexistence, both, neither) - originate dependently. We know this\nis so because there is no such thing as phenomena which doesn't arise dependent upon causes and\nconditions.\n\"Whatever is dependently co-arisen\n756\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThat is explained to be emptiness.\nThat, being a dependent designation\nIs itself the middle way.\nSomething that is not dependently arisen,\nSuch a thing does not exist.\nTherefore a non-empty thing\nDoes not exist.\"\n-- Nāgārjuna\nSoh Wei YuAdmin\nSoh:\nrecently i have been reading some old posts by kyle dixon\ni found that his salt analogy to be a good explanation of chariot applied to all phenomena\nfrom https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2012/03/a-sun-that-never-sets.html\n[6:00 am, 17/11/2021] John Tan: Yes.

If you suggest that there is\na truly existent ultimate nature, you are an eternalist plain and simple and your position is no different\nthan Vedanta.\nSo the realm of the uncreated/Nirvana has none of the flaws of the theories of eternalism\nYour interpretation certainly does, for it is precisely eternalism, i.e. reification of a truly existent,\nunconditioned nature.\nthe Buddha was not against all eternalism\nYes, śrāvakas usually believe that the Buddha advocated for some species of eternalism, however this\nnotion is refuted by Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna.\n760\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nTo step out of impermanence, you need to be timeless - without time affecting you, bringing with it change,\ndecay and death - this is the eternal that the Buddha actively told us to seek. This is called akaliko - timeless.\nThis is just Śrāvakayāna dualism.\nAs the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra states:\n\"Outside of the saṃskṛtas [conditioned dharmas], there are no asaṃskṛta [unconditioned dharmas], and\nthe true nature [bhūtalakṣaṇa] of the saṃskṛta is exactly asaṃskṛta. The saṃskṛtas being empty, etc. the\nasaṃskṛtas themselves are also empty, for the two things are not different. Besides, some people, hearing\nabout the defects of the saṃskṛtadharmas, become attached [abhiniveśante] to the asaṃskṛtadharmas\nand, as a result of this attachment, develop fetters.\"\nGoing on to say that the person who rejects the saṃskṛtas is attached to the asaṃskṛtas by attributing to\nthem the characteristics of non-production [anutpāda], and by the very fact of this attachment those\nasaṃskṛtas are immediately transformed into saṃskṛtas. Which, as I have pointed out before; is\nequivalent to the act of turning dharmatā into a dharmin by considering it to be a separate, existent,\nunconditioned, free-standing nature. It should instead be understood that the very non-arising of\nconditioned dharmas [saṃskṛtadharmas] is the unconditioned [saṃskṛta] dharmatā. It is an epistemic\nrealization which dispels ignorance by severing the causes and conditions for invalid cognition... not an\nontological X that exists on its own (that is what Vedanta teaches).\nAnd so in this vein Nāgārjuna states: \"Neither saṃsāra or nirvāṇa exist; instead, nirvāṇa is the thorough\nknowledge of saṃsāra\" -- Yuktiṣāṣṭika\nSaṃsāra is the result of confusion, nothing is ultimately established in saṃsāra (conditioned phenomena\nor otherwise)... and if nothing is ultimately established in saṃsāra, saṃsāra is itself never truly established\nat anytime. If saṃsāra is not established, nirvāṇa is not established. Recognizing the true nature\n[satyalakṣhaṇa] of saṃsāra, as innately unproduced [anutpāda] is to realize that the allegedly conditioned\n[saṃskṛta] is a misconception of ignorance, and therefore the conditioned has in fact been unconditioned\n[asaṃskṛta] from the very beginning. That is awakening to the unconditioned, and that is the awakening\nwhich is the doorway to the cessation of suffering.\n\"Since arising, abiding and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established; since the\nconditioned is never established, how can the unconditioned be established? -- Nāgārjuna\nSo it is not that there is indeed an unconditioned nirvāṇa which abides apart from conditioned\nphenomena. The 'unconditioned' is merely knowledge of the actual nature of 'conditioned' phenomena.\nPhenomena [dharmins] are themselves, in essence, unconditioned, their unconditioned nature is their\ndharmatā.\n\"Good son, the term 'unconditioned' is also a word provisionally invented by the First Teacher. Now, if the\nFirst Teacher provisionally invented this word, then it is a verbal expression apprehended by imagination.\nAnd, if it is a verbal expression apprehended by imagination, then, in the final analysis, such an imagined\ndescription does not validate a real thing. Therefore, the unconditioned does not exist.\" --\nSaṃdhinirmocana Sūtra\n761\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThis is why nirvāṇa is a cessation; it is the exhaustion of one's ignorance regarding the nature of\nphenomena. What ceases, is cause for the further arising and proliferation of the very delusion which\nlends to the misperception of arising, abiding and destruction in conditioned phenomena.\nFor this reason, nirvāṇa is said to be 'permanent', because due to the exhaustion of cause for the further\nproliferation of saṃsāra, saṃsāra no longer has any way to arise. However nirvāṇa is also a conventional\ndesignation which is only relevant in relation to the delusion of saṃsāra which has been exhausted, and\nso nirvāṇa is nothing real that exists in itself either, it is merely the absence of affliction, an exhaustion, an\nunbinding, a release, an extinguishing, a liberation, a cessation... that is nirvāṇa. There is sickness and\nthere is health... health is simply the absence of sickness.\nSo the correct understanding of phenomena, reveals that phenomena (as misperceived via ignorance)\nhave never occurred in the way one's ignorance made them appear. As a result it is seen that there has\nnever been anything which was bound, nor anything which required liberation.

And as a result we believe that we interact with objects\nand entities that have \"arisen\" or have been born and now exist. We also then believe that said objects\nwill disintegrate at some point and said entities will die, including ourselves, thus ceasing to exist, being\nrendered non-existent, the second of the four extremes that pertain to an entity.\nWhen we awaken to see the actual nature of phenomena, then we experientially recognize that those\nobjects and entities have never arisen/been born in the first place. And that is \"non-arising\". That lack of\ninitial birth or origination means the entity or dharma that could coincide with any of the four extremes is\nunfindable.\n762\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nA simple way to communicate it would be akin to wandering in the desert and suddenly perceiving an\noasis with foliage and water etc., one would be elated and would truly be convinced that there is an oasis\nthere. Convinced that trees, grass, water are all present there and one is genuinely perceiving objects that\nthey have encountered, that these objects exist, have originated in the desert and are real.\nUpon getting closer to the oasis the appearance begins to dissipate and one realizes that the oasis was\nonly a mirage from the very beginning. At that point one has a realization that is akin to \"non-arising\",\nbecause one recognizes that the oasis was merely a byproduct of causes and conditions, governed by\nconfusion, and was never there to begin with, it was non-arisen from the very beginning. As such it makes\nno sense to say that the oasis as an entity ever existed, or ceased to exist, or both or neither, the oasis\nwas simply a misconception predicated on ignorance from the very beginning.\nIn the same way all phenomena appear to originate due to the presence of ignorance [avidyā], however\nonce ignorance is uprooted then phenomena are seen to be primordially unoriginated. As discussed in\nthe Yukisastikakarika:\nWhen the perfect gnosis sees that things come from ignorance as condition, nothing will be\nobjectified, either in terms of arising or destruction.\nAnd,\nSince the Buddhas have stated that the world is conditioned by ignorance, why is it not reasonable\n[to assert] that this world is [a result of] conceptualization?\nSince it comes to an end when ignorance ceases; why does it not become clear then that it was\nconjured by ignorance?\nThe Acintyastavaḥ states:\nLike a dream, an illusion, [or] seeing two moons: Thus have You seen the world, as a creation not\ncreated as real. Like a son who is born, established, and dies in a dream, the world, You have said, is not\nreally born, does not endure, and is not destroyed... According to cognition of truth, [however], You\nmaintain that there is no annihilation or permanence. [You] assert that the entire world is empty of\nsubstance, like a mirage.\nHere, the Lokātītastava discusses how origination and destruction or cessation that leads to non-\nexistence are rendered impossibilities after recognizing non-arising:\nYou have stated that all arising is like the arising of an illusion. Therefore You have fully understood\nthat this world has arisen due to imagination. It is unreal, [and] not having originated it cannot be\ndestroyed.\nThat is how the limbs of the tetralemma are rendered null and void. Therefore as you can see these\nexplanations are fully in line with the actual logic and reasoning of the buddhadharma.\n763\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n-\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ovv64j/notself_doesnt_mean_that_there_isnt_a_self/h7ge\nxiu/?context=8&depth=9\n[5:41 AM, 8/4/2021] John Tan: ”\nSoh Wei YuAdmin\nAfter anatta realisation, further investigation into emptiness teachings and prajnaparamita and mmk\nreveals that the empty nature of self equally applies to the empty nature of all phenomena, revealing that\nthe nature of all appearances to be its non arising, its lack of coming and going, arising, abiding and\nceasing, which leaves appearances equivalent to magical illusions like a rainbow or phantom or mirage.\nAs I explained in 2016,\n[17/1/16, 3:30:25 PM] Soh Wei Yu: when we scroll text on facebook, people with erroneous essence view\nthink that the text is actually going up and down, or as if the text below is hidden below and we have to\nscroll down and 'get there'. but when we realize D.O. and non-arising we don't see phenomena arising,\nabiding, ceasing, going to or coming from... so scrolling of text is merely appearing without movement,\nabiding no where and going no where, like a magical illusion.\nthe same for all other phenomena 'in the universe'\n[17/1/16, 9:33:31 PM] John Tan: Quite good.

Where did it go? Is there\narising or can you say there is arising? This is crucial and key to understanding of emptiness and\nreleasing. Why whatever arises in dependence due to conditions cannot be said to arise nor cease? And\nthat is the middle path.\nNeither arises, Nor not arises.\nNeither ceases, Nor not ceases.\nNeither existence Nor non existence.\nNeither affirmation Nor negation.\nAnd these must be understood the right way with right view. Not for beautiful language. If consciousness\nceases this moment can you say it ceases?

I have told you many times you must\nunderstand from dependent origination and not just emptiness. Because whatever arises do not arise by\nitself. Now what did Buddha say? If there is karma and conditions, can phenomena not manifest? If this\nmind moment ceases, can next mind moment not arise if conditions are there? No, mind moment will\narise on conditions, so there is no real cessation. Yet this mind moment is not the same as next mind\nmoment, and they cannot be said to be different either. It cannot be said to have not ceased, and cannot\nbe said to have ceased. As such whatever arises in dependence is non-arisen. Then you talk about the\ndirect experience of mind… Of the six entries and exits. Experience and view. Get it?\nYou must first separate direct experience from view. Talk about non-dual experience, how it can be\ndistorted with view, and from anatta you realise right explanation of the experience should be dependent\norigination, emptiness and non-arisen. Not from essence view. And middle path is understood that way.\nThere is not creation but not no creation. Middle path is dependent origination. Because we are so\naccustomed to essence view, we cannot get used to dependent origination.

Therefore, by a mere expression of language—through words—it is also said that the\nrelative truth and ultimate truth are “indivisible.” Although the expanse is like this, separate categories are\nmade merely in terms of the conventional, based on the way things appear. In this way, all phenomena\nincluded within samsara—all that is comprised by distorted perceptions and all that appears through the\npower of dualistic thought—are not real when analyzed. They are fluctuating and impermanent;\ntherefore, these deceptive phenomena are the relative truth. And all phenomena comprised by great\nnirvana—which is difficult to realize and thus profound, free from constructs, and which is the luminous\nclarity of wisdom’s knowing, relinquished from all suffering—are beyond material and momentary\nphenomena.

His mind becomes ensnared with desire, and he is frightened and ashamed in front of his\ncompanions.

Saying phenomena are unproduced and unarisen indicates that they are not\ninherently produced and do not inherently arise, although they are produced and arise conventionally.\n~ Searching for the Self, p. 233-234, Dalai Lama & Thubten Chodron”\nKyle Dixon, 2019:\n“...the heart of the buddhadharma and Dzogchen in general is the jñāna that results from recognizing the\nnon-arising of phenomena.\nIf that jñāna is revealed in your mindstream then you will know the meaning of dependent origination.\nAll practices of Dzogchen and the buddhadharma aim to awaken you so that this is experientially known.\n…\nYou have to differentiate interdependence i.e., dependent existence [parabhāva] and dependent\norigination [pratītyasamutpāda].\nThey are not the same.\n…\nNāgārjuna discusses the difference in many of his works.\nParabhāva is as you mentioned above, “interdependence,” things depending on things in a coarse sense.\nNāgārjuna states that parabhāva is actually a guise for svabhāva, which is the main object of refutation in\nhis view. Thus mistaking parabhāva for pratītyasamutpāda is a major error.\nHe also states that s/he who sees dependent existence [parabhāva], inherent existence [svabhāva],\nexistence [bhāva] or non-existence [abhāva], do not see the truth of the buddha’s teaching.\nThe main point is that we cannot mistake dependent origination [pratītyasamutpāda] for mere\ninterdependence.”\n“The Correct View of Dependent Origination\nJohn Tan just said: This comment by Malcolm is really good.\nSession Start: Wednesday, August 09, 2006\n(11:32 PM) AEN: namdrol:\n774\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWhile it is true that many non-Buddhist paths a renunciate and so on, the unique feature of the Buddha's\npath is understanding that phenomena are dependently originated. Dependent origination is critical in\ndeveloping a correct view.\nIs the mere knowledge that phenomena dependently originated sufficient? No.\nIt is possible to hold a view of dependent origination which is nevertheless realist or substantialist in\nnature-- a perfect example of this would the way Thich Nhat Hahn's \"interbeing\" is generally understood.\nHere, it is never questioned that the mutually depedendent phenomena exist in dependence because\nthey all exist together. In general, this is also the naive understanding of dependent origination.\n(11:32 PM) AEN: Even so, this view of dependent orgination already marks the beginning of turning from a\nwrong or incorrect view, to a right or correct view.\nHow do we move from a substantialist interpretation of dependent origination to a non-substantialist\nunderstanding?\nWe need to first be open to having our existential assumptions undermined. Any clinging to existence and\nnon-existence must be eradicated before we can properly appreciate the meaning of DO. Some people\nthink this simply means clinging to inherent or ultimate existence. But this is not so. Whatever arises in\ndependence also must be devoid of mere existence as well.\nTo understand this fully we must understand the perfection of wisdom sutras in their entirety and the\nthinking of Nagarjuna and his followers.\n(11:32 PM) AEN:\nWhen we have truly understood that phenomena are devoid existence and non-existence because they\nare dependently originated; we can understand that phenomena do not arise, since existence and\ndependence are mutually exclusive. Any existence that can be pointed to is merely putative and nominal,\nand does not bear any reasoned investigation.\nSince phenomena are dependently originated, and the consequence of dependent origination is that\nthere are no existing existents, we can understand that existents are non-arising by nature. As\nBuddhapalita states \"We do not claim non-existence, we merely remove claims for existing existents.\"\nWhatever does not arise by nature is free from existence and non-existence, and that is the meaning of\n\"freedom from proliferation.\" In this way, dependent origination = emptiness, and this is the correct view\nthat Buddhas elucidate. There is no other correct view than this.\nN”\n“The Only Way to the Ultimate Truth\n[10:05 PM, 4/12/2021] Soh Wei Yu: malcolm (Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith):\nMMK refutes any kind of production other than dependent origination. It is through dependent\norigination that emptiness is correctly discerned. Without the view of dependent origination, emptiness\ncannot be correctly perceived, let alone realized. The MMK rejects production from self, other, both, and\ncauseless production, but not dependent origination. The MMK also praises the teaching of dependent\norigination as the pacifier of proliferation in the mangalam. The last chapter of MMK is on dependent\norigination. The MMK nowhere rejects dependent origination, it is in fact a defense of the proper way to\n775\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nunderstand it. The only way to the ultimate truth (emptiness) is through the relative truth (dependent\norigination), so if one’s understanding of relative truth is flawed, as is the case with all traditions outside\nof Buddhadharma, and even many within it, there is no possibility that ultimate truth can be understood\nand realized.\n...\n[long excerpt cut out – refer to original link]\n[10:10 PM, 4/12/2021] John Tan: The DO part is really good.\n[10:11 PM, 4/12/2021] John Tan: When did malcom say that?

Even mere appearances\nfree from all elaborations and conceptualities, they inadvertently manifest therefore the term\n\"appearances\". They do not manifest randomly or haphazardly, they are valid mode of arising and that is\ndependent arising. When it is \"valid\" means it is the acceptable way of explanation and not \"rabbit horn\"\nwhich is non-existence.

There is right\nunderstanding of \"freedom from all elaborations\" that is why Mipham has to qualify that it is not\n\"blankness\", it does not reject \"mere appearance\", it must be understood from the perspective of\n\"coalescence\"...and so on and so forth. Similarly, there is right understanding of \"arising\" conventionally\nand that is DO.\nSo when we clearly see how essence = true existence = independence of causes and conditions are\nuntenable for anything to arise, we see dependent arising.”\nBook Recommendation: Beacon of Certainty\n777\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nLink to Beacon of Certainty: https://www.amazon.com/Miphams-Beacon-Certainty-Illuminating-\nPerfection/dp/0861711572\n[11:20 AM, 3/26/2021] John Tan: I need to find a day to write about mmk 2 truth model, the more I look at\nit the more beauty I see...lol\n[11:21 AM, 3/26/2021] John Tan: It is fortunate that you have insight into anatta\n[11:23 AM, 3/26/2021] John Tan: What you lack is a strong view to articulate the experiences and insights\nwithout falling into extremes.\n[11:23 AM, 3/26/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n[11:24 AM, 3/26/2021] John Tan: So far I can't find a teacher or books that can beautifully blend the whole\nthing together.

Only\nrecently did AtR \"resonate\" with me, this time in a very different way - I was only a casual visitor before. I am\nslowly going over material, since it seems to speak to me in a new voice now, and familiarizing myself with the\nAtR terms, and definitions.\nWhen Soh wrote that Thusness said certain practitioners get stuck at certain stages for a decade, I can totally\nrelate. I had felt \"stuck\" for some while - there were important insights, but after several years, the underlying\nexperience was the same and it seemed I was cycling through the same experiences and insights. I cannot begin\nto tell you how frustrating that was.\n780\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nMy background has been a mix of Advaita/Buddhism/non-traditional, but mostly Advaita. A little over a decade\nago (a Buddhist teacher had mentioned a koan \"What is self? Shine the light of awareness back on itself\"). After\nabout 12-18 months of meditation and revisiting this koan, there was a radical shift, realizing that \"I\" was not-\nmind, not-body. There was this Awareness/is-ness/Still Presence from which thoughts and sensatons of body-\nmind, which I was previously identified with, emerged. I had no spiritual education outside of a book and a few\nCDs of dharma talks by a well known Buddhist teacher (back then the wikipedia page for \"non-duality\"\nconsisted of maybe 2 sentences and what was online at the time was sparse, confusing and misleading) ... while\nthe first few months were filled with bliss (and a tremendous letting go of energy), I was left disoriented with how\nto contextualize and interpret my experience. At the time, I had no words for whatever i was experiencing.\nBut most noticeably, for the first time in my life, I could simply be without any thoughts. There was just ...\nStillness, Awareness without thoughts, just utter peace. (I described this as no-mind, but I do not know if it is the\nsame term as how AtR would define it) The process of \"selfing\" would often subside spontaneoulsy and the\nStillness deepend. Of course, this was always temporary.\nOver time, I realized there was not longer an \"I\" that was in the world, but the appearance of the world was \"in\"\nAwareness. Nothing was ever experienced, could be experienced other than Awareness. When this happened,\nthere was like a small \"pop\" and what I felt as physical, corporeal body was just sensations and a concept of\n\"body\" arising within Awareness. Ever since then, the experience of the body has been empty, hollow (but not in\nany negative, dissociated sense), spacious. The body as an identified contraction lifted, old aches and pains\ndisappeared. There was no particular location where I was (But identification with sticky thoughts/stories\nremained as a problem)\nI would articulate this phase as the Universe aware of Itself, experiencing Itself. I have read that others describe\ntheir experience as \"I am the trees, I am the sky\" ... but I found that misleading, as it implies as if the \"I\" became\na larger physical self and somehow one was identified physically and mentally with trees or sky, as if I was\ninside a tree or that my body had enlarged its boundaries to somehow incorporate trees and clouds... no..\nI would describe it more as...the entire phenomenal radiant Universe, the trees, sky, birds, cars, every sensation,\nevery thought, these all shone with a brilliant immediacy as appearances in awarenesss, with no boundaries\nseparating them, arising no-where and everywhere. Everything was \"you\", for there was nothing not illuminated\nby awareness, and \"I\" was not other than the open field of awareness. This was your Original Face as it had\nalways been, appearing to no-one.\nWhat AtR refers to as luminosity, I would've refered to as the brilliant radiance of Awareness. From the first\nshift, everything looked different. Objects seemed to shine with a brilliance I had never experienced before. The\nfirst meal I ate post-shift was the most delicious meal I had ever experienced. And especially, at first, every\nnatural thing, trees, ocean, sky danced with a rhythm and vibrancy I had never experienced, not even as a child.\nEvery moment was fresh, every moment new (and this has carried me steady even when I fell into occasional\nnihilistic views)\nThere was just consciousness and the appearances within consciousness, and I was that. The most simplest\nexpression was simply abiding Awareness of Awareness, until there was just Awareness. There was seeing, but\nno seer, hearing but no hearer, feeling but no feeler, just seeing, hearing, feeling (thought it was no-self within\nthe context of a background awareness). But the realization and articulation of insights seemed important - it\nseemed to lock the experience in.\n781\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n*\nSometime last year, I realized that the self, the \"me\" never was. Prior, there was always some expectation of a\n\"me\" gaining insights, losing a \"self\", but it was very clear the \"I\" that arose was simply another thought.\nBut last year, there were several insights. I realized that the self never was. Prior, it felt like there was some \"I\"\nthat was progressing and gaining insight, then there was just the seeing that the \"I\" never was, itwas simply\nanother thought...there was never anything other than consciousness. I could sense a shift, but intellectually, in\nterms of a path, I couldn't find anything.\nIntellectually, I knew that there is no gap between the backgroudnd awareness and its objects - it was just\nAwareness, but this gap never fully dissolved. I felt some dissonance and confined by the current crop of\nAdvaitic/Neo-advaitic teachers on the circuit, unsatisfied with some of their arguments. I felt stifled by the\nAdvaitic obsession that Awareness was the unchanging, permanent, Reality, all other forms being unreal.\n*\nFrom my early stages, I had read several books by western Buddhists: Hagen, Kornfield, Ingram, Wilber (he says\nhe is a practicing Zen buddhist, but he seems to writes from an Advaitic perspective where consciousness is the\nabsolute reality).\nDavid Loy's Non-duality seemed to confirm my conviction that Advaita and Bhuddism led to the same insights\nbut with different terms (and in reverse, many Advaitins claim Buddha was really talking about the same thing).\nSo over time, I gravitated towards Advaita/Neo-Advaita, Goode, Wheeler, Ramana/Nisargardatta, Spira,\nTollifson, but I never liked any of the more nihilistic non-dualists (Parsons, etc) .... the experiential component of\nDirect Path was very compelling.\nI went through a period of textual deconstruction, realizing that our normal way of linguistically constructing\nthe world was reinforcing objects as inherently real and self-existing. (But this was always within the\nassumption that Awareness/Consciouness was the \"I\" of experience...at the time, I had not encountered\nconvincing arguments, or perhaps was not ready, to deconstruct awareness itself)\nI felt a desire to revisit emptiness teachings again, and after reading AtR, this time around, I realized I had\ninterpreted everything within the context of a background awareness, what Loy called substance-view.\nFrom reading the first 2 stages, and a brief read of Soh's No-Mind/One-Mind, those descriptions are very\nfamiliar with me. Although I was familiar with many of AtR concepts, the nuances and how Thusness\ndifferntiates different aspects of each stage are very new.\nIt was not easy, but I began the process of questioning the existence of an all-pervasive, permanent, background\nawareness.\nIn the same way that there is never a form that arises without a background, never does a background arise\nwithout a form. Even awareness is not the ultimate, it is empty itself, and arises co-depently with form. In a\nway, it is simple, but this dropping was both subtle and radical.\n782\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSoh's description of Advaita's view of non-duality is very apt: that it subsumes all forms as modulations of\nawareness whereas Buddhism gives primacy to emptiness and the dependent origination of forms.\n*\nIn the wave vs Ocean metaphor, the Advaitic interpretation is not that \"you\" are simultaneously wave and part\nof the Ocean (like an arm belonging to a body), but the identity of the wave is identical to the Ocean and the\nwave is a modulation of the Ocean.\nIn the Buddhist view, there is no ocean nature from which the waves spring forth, nor is there ocean nature\nfound inherent or embedded within the waves, but the myriad waves of forms all arise co-dependently, empty of\ninherent existence. There is form, there is no subject/agent/doer experiencing form, prior or after to form, just\nthe luminous display of form.\nBefore, I did not realize how central DO was to understanding emptiness, anatta. In Advaita, transactional\nreality is almost negated, with emptiness and DO and forms, conventional reality regains a kind of poignancy. It\nis hard to describe, the fundamental experience is the same, the emphasis and flavour is very different.\nThank you Soh, Thusness, and all contributors to AtR. For a long time, I felt stuck without a path forward. I'll\nprobably have many questions moving forward\n[7:54 AM, 6/3/2021] John Tan: Not bad. He should relook these insights and experiences and ask the\nfollowing:\n1. If everything is me, then the sense of \"me\" must also disappear at that moment of\nexperience. Otherwise one must mature the experience into no-mind and then anatta as an insight.\n2. If later it is realized that there is no me/self/Self as an insight and experience (anatta), then one must\nrefine the view and question how does the sense of me/self/Self arise in the first place?\n3. Then bring this insight from the refinement of view into all phenomena and all actions.\n4. Therefore not only there is no seer in the seen just the seen, there is no seeing and nothing seen. No\nself, no others and no aggregates.\n5. If this is understood only as negations, then one is not free from extremes and all elaborations.\n6. Therefore conventionally, there is self, others, seer, seeing and seen. There are causes and\neffects. There is arising, abiding and ceasing and the only valid mode of arising is dependent arising.\n7. Point 1, 2, 3 praxis is on samatha and vipassana. Direct experience and insights. To mature this insight\nof anatta, the path of analysis is needed.\n8. Point 4-6 thorough reasoning and analysis is added to relinquish cognitive obscuration.\n9. If he is interested, he should look into mmk (Nagarjuna's text Mūlamadhyamakakārikā), it will expose the\nmany hidden nuances and subtleties of our cognitive obscurations. Patience is needed to get used to the\n783\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nline of reasoning of Nagarjuna. But no need to get involved in those polemics of the Tibetan schools.\n[8:08 AM, 6/3/2021] John Tan: 10. Lastly one should understand the praxis of the 2 stanzas and mmk are\ndifferent. The 2 stanzas are using samatha and vipassana to directly see through mental constructs to\nrealize one's nature (direct path) whereas mmk is via path of analysis and reasoning. So when reading\nmmk, one must adhere strictly to the conventional 3 fold structure of seer-seeing-seen. See through the\nstructures and deconstruct step by step. The ultimate purpose and result are the same except mmk\nexposes all the very subtle and hidden cognitives obscurations that we are unable even post anatta\ninsight. So if one is interested in bringing anatta insight to maturity and perfection, mmk is needed.\nSoh quoted from book:\nTsongkhapa notes that yod min (lit. “existing-not”) means nonexistent (med pa) while med min (lit. “not-not-\nexisting”) effectively means existent, and accordingly he interprets the first alternative to mean “not existent\nultimately” and the second to mean “not nonexistent conventionally.” 491 Otherwise, Tsongkhapa claims, this\nview would be none other than that of the “Chinese Hashang.” To empty the mind of all concepts of existence,\nnonexistence, etc., does not constitute discriminating wisdom (prajñā, shes rab), which should be acutely aware\nof what exists and what does not exist. This kind of emptiness is simply a state of unawareness. In the LRC\nTsongkhapa expresses the opinion that most traditions in Tibet had deviated to this extreme. What needs to be\nnegated, he asserts, is not all conceptuality whatsoever, but the false apprehension of true existence\n(bden ’dzin). By refuting the object of that mistaken concept and focusing upon its emptiness of true existence,\none realizes the nature of reality. Having properly identified the apprehension of true existence, it is readily\napparent that there are many concepts (rtog pa) that do not involve apprehension of the true existence of self\nor phenomena. This refutes the position that all concepts are to be refuted. 492 Tsongkhapa and Go ram pa\nevidently understand the relationship between conceptuality and the apprehension of true\nexistence differently. Go ram pa understands conceptuality ipso facto as involving apprehension of true\nexistence, whereas Tsongkhapa does not accept that conceptuality is always associated with the apprehension\nof true existence. 493 Go ram pa agrees that the object of the apprehension of true existence must be refuted.\nBut to maintain that the mere absolute negation that is the nonfinding of that object through rational analysis\nis the definitive ultimate (don dam mtshan nyid pa), 494 and to maintain that clinging to or apprehension of\nthat emptiness is not an object of refutation, 495 is “alien to the Mādhyamika textual tradition” (dbu ma’i\ngzhung lugs las ’das). Go ram pa quotes several Indian sources that support his contention that a definitive view\nis beyond verbal-conceptual formulation. The definitive ultimate is realized non-dualistically by sublime beings’\nmeditation (* āryasamāpatti, ’phags pa’i mnyam bzhag). He also quotes Candrakīrti to the effect that deceptive\nreality (saṃvṛti, kun rdzob) is the object of false seeing. 496 Therefore, unlike the emptiness seen directly\n(pratyakṣena, mngon sum du) by sublime beings, the emptiness of absolute negation that is ascertained by\ninferential reasoning (anumāna, rjes dpag) is just deceptively true. 497 One might object that in some contexts\nthe ultimate reality is said to be the mere absolute negation of emptiness, and that both realities\nare posited only by a worldly mind (’ jig rten pa’i blo) 498— which seems to imply that it is incorrect to define the\nultimate as the object of sublime equipoise. In reply, Go ram pa explains that truthlessness is realized in relation\nto a mind that apprehends true existence, and the designation of “ultimate reality” there refers to a conceptually\nformulated ultimate. The reason that designation is made is because its referent, the conceptually formulated\nultimate, is the object of a mind that understands (rtogs) the nature of reality instead of (lit., “in relation to”— la\nltos par) apprehending true existence. It is necessary to call the conceptual ultimate “ultimate” because it must\nbe realized prior to realizing the nonconceptual ultimate (aparyāyaparamārtha, rnam grangs ma yin pa’i don\n784\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\ndam). To claim that a conceptual object, which is apprehended as the absence of true existence by negating true\nexistence, is the definitive ultimate (don dam mtshan nyid pa), is to confuse the concept (sāmānyalakṣaṇa, spyi\nmtshan) of the ultimate (a pointing finger) with the ultimate per se (the moon). 499 The implication is that if the\nconceptual ultimate is designated and accepted with reference to a worldly mind (’ jig rten pa’i blo), then there is\nno reason why the nonconceptual, definitive ultimate should not be defined in relation to a nonconceptual\nmind, which is sublime gnosis. Thus, Go ram pa does not deny that\nreasoning and concepts are necessary in realizing the nature of the ultimate. He grants a propaedeutic function\nto the conceptual formulation of emptiness but does not accept that the Gelug formulation of emptiness as\nabsolute negation qualifies as a definitive ultimate. This follows logically from his assumption that conventional\nreality is pervaded by conceptuality and that conceptuality is pervaded by ignorance. 500 Thus, any concept—\neven a concept of the mere absence of inherent existence— is not a definitive ultimate. 6.3.1.2.2. Go ram pa on\nMeditative Practice Go ram pa’s critique of Tsongkhapa’s approach to meditation is based on the implication\nthat clinging to (zhen pa) or apprehending (’ dzin pa) emptiness is not something to be abandoned. According to\nGo ram pa, Tsongkhapa reasons that if the apprehension of emptiness is only something to be abandoned, then\nthere is no point in ascertaining it in the first place, as the antidote for apprehending true existence (bden\npar ’dzin pa). Go ram pa counters with several quotations from sūtras and śāstras, such as the famous\nstatement of Nāgārjuna, The victors have taught emptiness To definitely eliminate all views.\nThose who have a view of emptiness Are said to be incurable. 501\nPettit, John W..

But\nit will take a while to get used to the different reasonings in mmk. So still a lot of research needs to be\ndone. Start will chapter 1,2,7 first. They contain all the reasoning logics. Rest are just applying the same\nreasoning methods.\n[9:35 PM, 6/3/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Timeless Deviation to the Nature of Knowables The meditation of\ninseparable phenomena and emptiness is called “emptiness endowed with the supreme aspect.” Not\nknowing how emptiness and interdependence abide in nonduality, you decide that emptiness is a\nnothingness that has never existed and that is not influenced at all by qualities or defects. Then you\nunderestimate the cause and effect of virtue and vice, or else lapse exclusively into the nature of all things\nbeing originally pure, primordially free, and so forth. Bearing such emptiness, the relative level of\ninterdependence is not mastered. In this respect, this is what is known as mahamudra: one’s basic nature\nis unoriginated and, since it is neither existent nor nonexistent, eternal nor nil, true nor false, nor any\nother such aspects, it has no existence whatsoever. Nonetheless, its unceasing radiance arises as the\nrelative level of all kinds of interdependence, so it is known as emptiness having the core of\ninterdependence and interdependence having the nature of emptiness. Therefore, emptiness does not\nstray to the nature of knowables. In the Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way it is said: Anything that\ndoesn’t arise dependently Is a phenomenon that has no existence. Therefore anything that is not empty Is\na phenomenon that has no existence. And as said in the Commentary on Bodhichitta: It is taught that the\nrelative plane is emptiness, And emptiness alone is the relative plane.” – The Royal Seal of Mahamudra,\nVolume 2\n[10:07 PM, 6/3/2021] John Tan:\n[10:10 PM, 6/3/2021] John Tan: Emptiness is ultimate nature whereas the radiance of clarity is relative as\nillusionariness of appearance arising dependently.\n[10:12 PM, 6/3/2021] John Tan: Mahamudra seems to be in line with Tsongkhapa thought.\n[10:12 PM, 6/3/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[10:13 PM, 6/3/2021] John Tan: Actually Mipham also. However they seem to suggest the ultimate\npurpose of mmk is to cease conceptualities.\n[10:01 PM, 6/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Nāgārjuna states:\n\"When the perfect vidyā sees\nThat things come from ignorance as condition,\nNothing will then be objectified,\nEither in terms of arising or destruction...\n...Since the Buddhas have stated\nThat the world is conditioned by ignorance,\nWhy is it not reasonable [to assert]\n788\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThat this world is [a result of] conceptualization?\nSince it comes to an end\nWhen ignorance ceases;\nWhy does it not become clear then\nThat it was conjured by ignorance?\"\n[10:02 PM, 6/4/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Nagarjuna seems to see the end goal as the exhaustion of all\nphenomena through the dissolution of ignorance and its conceptualization\n[10:09 PM, 6/4/2021] John Tan: I have told you there are 2 purposes already.

What does understanding the unconditioned and uncompounded or essencelessness\ntell us? How is this linked to conceptualities?\n[10:29 PM, 6/4/2021] John Tan: Then when you come face to face of your nature you know and will\nunderstand.\n[10:32 PM, 6/4/2021] John Tan: Also go slow, it is not a one day thing.

It is because the ultimate truth of things is\ntheir non-arising or emptiness, and what are those 'things' that are ultimately empty? They are\nconventions which are mistaken to be real things. So these alleged conventional objects are precisely\nwhat are realized to be unreal, and this means that we can relate to conventions freely because they are\nnever pointing to anything actually 'real' or established. All conventions are simply useful nominal\ndesignations, tools for communication. The problem arises when we mistake these conventions to be\nsomething more than just a convention.\nConventions are reliable as long as they are not subjected to keen investigation. That is how 'convention'\nis defined per buddhism, a correct convention [tathyasaṃvṛti] is, according to Śāntarakṣita; \"something\ncan be tacitly accepted as long as it is not critically investigated, that is characterized by arising and decay,\nand that has causal effectivity.\" So the validity of a convention is measured by its efficacy, if it appears to\nfunction correctly, then it can be accepted as a correct convention prior to its investigation. In the wake of\ninvestigating any convention it will fail, since conventions cannot withstand proper scrutiny.\nSo there is no problem stating that there is a 'self-nature', because when that convention is subjected to\nscrutiny that self-nature would be ultimately unfindable. Yet the term \"self-nature\" is a conventional\ndesignation that is pointing to the capacity of 'wisdom' mentioned above, which is completely free from\nthe extremes of existence, non-existence, both and neither.\nFor instance, Longchenpa discusses that nature here:\n\"Mind itself [i.e., the nature of mind: tib. sems nyid] - naturally occurring timeless awareness [i.e., self-\noriginated primordial wisdom: tib. rang byung ye shes] - has no substance or characteristics. Since it is\nempty yet lucid and free of elaboration, it cannot be conceived of as 'this' or 'that'. Although it can be\nillustrated by a metaphor - 'It is like space' - if one reflects on space as the metaphor, it proves to have no\ncolor, no shape, or anything about it that is identifiable. Therefore, if the metaphor being used does not\nrefer to some 'thing', then the underlying meaning that it illustrates - mind itself, pure by nature - is not\nsomething that has ever existed in the slightest.\"\n8 liked this (Wednesday, September 10, 2014 at 10:14am)\n[1:32 PM, 6/6/2021] Soh Wei Yu: William kong realised anatta\n[1:36 PM, 6/6/2021] Soh Wei Yu: therefore what is negated is not conventions per se nor their causal\nefficacy but the four extremes\n[1:44 PM, 6/6/2021] Soh Wei Yu: also point 1 and 2... just like the Self, the Awareness seems so absolute\nand unchanging only due to a wrong view that misperceives luminous appearance into an inherently\nexisting substratum, likewise the world seems so real and inherently existing due to an unexamined view\nof inherency that reifies and solidifies appearances\n[1:59 PM, 6/6/2021] John Tan: What Kyle said is good. However that is not what Tsongkhapa key\ninsight. you have to understand Tsongkhapa elevated the status of conventional that is dependent\narising and emptiness of the conventional to equal the uncategorized ultimate. That is the categorized\nand uncategorised ultimate are of equal status. Means Pt 5 and 6.\n[2:11 PM, 6/6/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[2:23 PM, 6/6/2021] John Tan: For the 3 other schools, the conventional that is based on conventions and\nconceptualities are to be discarded after seeing through much like post anatta insight into direct non-\nconceptuality and non-duality.\n790\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBut why is conventional so important? As I have said many times Tsongkhapa did not dis-regard freedom\nfrom all elaborations and in his early days he did accept the ultimate purpose of mmk is freedom from all\nelaborations. Further he did mention about the categorized and the uncategorised ultimate, so the\nquestion is why did an accomplished master placed so much emphasis of the conventional?\n[4:20 PM, 6/6/2021] John Tan: Many enters mmk without having direct taste of what emptiness of\nsvabhava entails. Like what Westerhoff said:\n\"... give us very little insight into how the removal of such superimpositions could be possible and what it\nwould entail. The reason is obvious: according to the traditional Buddhist view, those who have realized\n(as opposed to merely understood) the absence of svabhāva and thereby emptiness are few and far\nbetween.\"\nNagarjuna's Madhyamaka Pg 51 by Westerhoff\nSo those having post anatta insight have the advantage to orientate themselves better and not get\nswayed by too much philosophical concepts and ideas about mmk and missed the essential points.\nHowever getting used to how Nagarjuna structured his lines of reasonings and agrumentations can be a\nreal pain initially if we do not have background why it is done that way. Nagarjuna was refuting the\nvarious views of his opponents and the major Buddhist systems of his time and frankly the tenets held by\nsome of the major systems are still deeply ingrained in most modern people today including you and\nme. So going through mmk helps us uncover all these traits and put them into perspective with thorough\ninvestigations. This is the part where many ATR people will find difficulties when jumping into mmk as\ntheir approach was more of koan based -- direct and intuitive. The mmk on the other hand is opposite,\nvery academic presented by the scholars even in the case of Westerhoff that is also why I din intro you his\nbook. But he prompted many very important points like on page 126, Westerhoff said:\n\"The Mādhyamika therefore has to explain how we can account for an object changing and persisting\nthrough time without having to assume that there is some unchanging aspect of the object which\nunderlies all change. Nāgārjuna claims that this can indeed be done. Understanding how this can be the\ncase becomes particularly important in the context of the Buddhist conception of the self when the\ntemporal continuity of persons has to be explained without reference to the concept of a persisting\nsubjective core (ātman).\"\nNagarjuna's Madhyamaka Pg 126 by Westerhoff\nThis is I think what Tsongkhapa clearly sees where many din where he creatively talk about how the mere-\nI takes rebirth.\nAlso in page 99, Westerhoff remarked:\n\"It also has to be noted that Nāgārjuna asserts, somewhat puzzlingly, that the absence of svabhāva, that\nis, emptiness, is not compatible with causation either\"\nThis part is also important how should dependent arising be understood on top of the idea of \"no\nessential nature\".\n791\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSo if you really want to understand what I meant by point 5-6 in my reply to William, you must\nunderstand these few questions.\nOtherwise you can learn from mmk to see how dependent relations in terms of nominal and existential\ndependencies, agency-action, object-properties and cause-conditions-effect relationships help to\nrender svabhava as untenable.These reasonings will help the mind to release itself from grasping after\nsvabhava in time to come. If the verses of mmk can go along with some vipassana exercises, that will be\nexcellent. The combination will liberate the mind from all ghost images created by languages and\nconceptual superimpositions in a thorough and powerful way. Unfortunately this can't be found in books\nso you have to devise urself along the way...lol.\nLabels: Anatta, Emptiness, Madhyamaka, Nagarjuna 0 comments | |\n“Yes, I think should add together as they represent the 2 different view of emptiness.\nFreedom from all elaborations and freedom from self-nature.\nYeah I included the two.

However it is not structured in the form of 2 truth and not as systematic and thorough.\n[11:12 PM, 5/23/2021] John Tan: But the view, path and result is not very different. We see through the\nself and realized it is a notion we have learnt, the mental constructs self is seen through, the purity and\nnon-dual of emptiness and appearances is directly tasted. Perceiver and perceived is deconstructed,\nagency and action is seen through, object and characteristic are also seen through except not as\nthorough and systematic as how mmk trained the mind to see, however mmk may not provide the\nconditions the sudden triggering insight to arise.\n[11:24 PM, 5/23/2021] John Tan: Like in prasangika mmk, the non-affirming negation, in the phases of\ninsights approach of the 2 stanzas, one is not interested in the affirmation, just the thorough\ndeconstruction of self construct. The seeing through of self in anatta is the direct experiential taste of\nnon-dual, purity and spontaneity.\n[11:39 PM, 5/23/2021] John Tan: So when someone describe to you, they say they have deconstruct\nself/Self but there is no direct taste of colors, smell, sensation, sound, no direct face to face of the\nradiance, pellucidity, purity, spontaneity, insubstantiality and non-duality of appearances, is that genuine\nauthentication?\n[12:00 AM, 5/24/2021] Soh Wei Yu: No its not.. more like impersonality\n[12:00 AM, 5/24/2021] Soh Wei Yu: Or nondoership”\n“John Tan:\n....Yes I do agree Arurag. However penetrating insight of the relationship between mental proliferation\nand the nature of appearances may not arise.\nExhaustion of background witness can come in the form of no-mind. It this case it will not be effortless as\nit remains as an occasional state since it is not realized as always and already so.\n795\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n2. Seeing through self/Self without realizing the cause of it.\n3. Seeing through self/Self by understanding the cause of it.\nNow this seeing the cause by identifying the negandum is of relevance to Andre's summary of mmk.\nIf we are clear of this, we can train the mind to see how mental reifications proliferate and dwell deep into\nthe nuance of \"inherency\" like separating existence, substance, self, production from whatever appears\nand the mind developed a keen and penetrating insight over time to the extend that it can penetrate all\nway up and down until ultimate emptiness is realized even through conceptuality. It is sort of the calculus\nof Buddhism.\nSo here I disagree with mipham although I have a lot of respect for mipham, I do think tsongkhapa is\nquite ingenious .\nBut is Tsongkhapa approach a good approach is a different question.\nWhen we look at the mipham's debate with the gelugpas about freedom from the 4 extremes of\nexistence, non-existence, neither and both, mipham did not adhere to any form of logical reasoning at all.\nIn fact he discredited the way of using profane logic and reasoning to understand the ultimate emptiness.\nSo the host of inconsistencies and contradictions cited by gelugpas faced by tetralema negation due to\ndouble negation, excluded middle and non-contradiction do not apply at the level of ultimate emptiness.\nTo mipham, the whole purpose of freeing oneself from the extremes is not to deduce a resultant that\nsatisfies the tetralemma. Even in gelugpas case of adding the qualifiers to first and second lemma only\nsatisfy first two and not all 4. In fact, conclusion drawn from negating the 4th lemma is absurd and\nnegating it with qualifiers added will result in emptiness as both inherently existing and conventionally\nnon-existence.\nSo to mipham, the purpose is purely non-affirmative negation. Sort of any form of \"yes I got it\" from\nconceptuality is negated and going through the 4 lemmas of negation cover all ground of conceptual\nloopholes where the mind can grasp or rest.\nAlso prasangika \"having no interest in the conventional except for refuting them mercilessly\" is also imo\nincorrect. That is conventional is not refuted, things exist conventionally but are empty at ultimate level.\nIn fact the term mipham use is \"coalescence\" and seeing union of emptiness and appearances is key.\nThis navigation between conventional and ultimate into coalescence is the crux of wisdom. I rem Mipham\nremarked that it is a matter of fine tunning in his polemics with the gelugpas, nothing significant in\nessence. To mipham, there is no need to invent \"inherent existence\" for negation on top of the\nconventional things causing confusions and insert qualifiers that do not appear in the sutras. What\nshould be negated' at the ultimate level is the very thing we experienced in daily life (conventional), not\nsome \"inherent existence\". It must be understood that the negation of phenomena at the ultimate level\ndoes not invalidate them conventionally. The two levels -- non existence at ultimate and existence in\n796\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nconventional, do not contradict each other unless one misunderstood what exist conventionally must\nexist ultimately and what does not exist ultimately must not exist conventionally which is a substantialist\nview.” – John Tan, 2020\nMichael Hernandez that is another problem. Let's take all 3 major representatives -- Mipham of Nyingma,\nTsongkhapa of Gelug and Dharmakirti of Yogacara. Each has his own definition. To Dharmakirti, linguistic\nand inference cognition is conceptual, perception is non-conceptual. Mipham has 3 categories of\nconceptualities if you studied them, I shall not elaborate here. To Tsongkhapa, all cognitions both\nconception and perception are conceptual. That is why Tsongkhapa sees everything as dependently\noriginated and conventional and negation of intrinsic as ultimate as nothing isn't conceptual and\ndependent.\nYet the so called \"conceptuality\" they all agreed that when dissolved that will give rise to non-conceptual\ngnosis is actually \"the very subtle tendency to dualify\" which imo is no different from \"inherent existence\".\nAs for me, after all these years of sorting out I prefer to retrict \"conceptual\" definition to mental activities\nthat relate to linguistic, mental inference and labelling which is closer to our daily usage. I do not consider\ndeep karmic tendencies as \"conceptual\".\nFor the ineffable beyond speech, there is nothing that can be said as it is the termination of all words and\nthe way of leaping to that can be by koan or by way of negation and deconstruction. We can also do\nsomatic or energy practices.\n[7:43 am, 06/11/2021] John Tan: Gilles Therrien Why isn't Heart Sutra points directly to the Heart but\ninstead points to freedom from all elaborations?\n[7:43 am, 06/11/2021] John Tan: Do you know y?\nSoh: oic... malcolm just said basically inexpressibility is like pointing to the lack of inherent existence.\nmalcolm:\nDharma is not a via negativa. Dependent origination = emptiness.\nInexpressibility simply means that we cannot point to anything and declare “this is how this appearance\nis.” It means there is nothing behind the relative to describe, and it means that descriptions of\nappearances fail to capture the reality of those appearances. But there is certainly nothing behind nor\nbeyond them, just as there is nothing behind a mirage, illusion, etc., but causes and conditions that lack\ninherent existence themselves.\n....\n797\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThere is no source, no pure love, or anything like it.

Pais\n9tuSpohnsordfeod ·\nA lil reflection:\nReality is naturally untainted by the three spheres of subject, object and action. As Maitreya said:\n\"Any thought of ‘subject’, ‘object’ and ‘action’\nIs held to be a cognitive obscuration.\"\nThere is no knower, known or knowing; no seer, seen or seeing; no perceiver, perceived or perception.\nThere is no knowing, seeing or perception, and yet appearances spontaneously radiate with a light of\ntheir own. This vivid clarity is the mind's nature arising as dependent origination. So, don't look inside\nseeking the nature of awareness - it is the moon itself, rising from behind the clouds.\nIt's like this that Dōgen is able to drop body and mind, and become actualized by the myriad things. Free\nfrom knower, known and knowing itself, there is no trace of awakening - for there is no sentient being to\nbecome awakened, nor insentient rock to remain asleep. And yet, this no-trace unfolds endlessly, for it is\nthe nature of the natural state that its radiance spontaneously manifests.\n[1:42 AM, 3/13/2021] John Tan:\n[1:44 AM, 3/13/2021] John Tan: Actually I thought Andre should already have such insight and experience\nlast year\n[6:29 AM, 3/13/2021] John Tan: I would say:\nIf there is no knowing, seeing or perception and yet appearances spontaneously radiates, then it should\nnot be dependent origination, should be spontaneous presence.\nIf there is name and form (namarupa), there is consciousness then there is dependent origination.\nLabels: Anatta, Emptiness, Spontaneous Presence 0 comments | |”\n“[1:23 AM, 3/31/2021] John Tan: why spontaneous presence is important for anatta insight?\n[1:24 AM, 3/31/2021] John Tan: Btw the phrase \"spontanous presence\" I used is not related to dzogchen.

It will guide us\ntowards the uncontrieved view albeit being only notional emptiness. ” – John Tan, 2021\n“John Tan's Reply to Andre on Emptiness\nAndre:\nOne may think that a laptop is empty because it *arose* dependent on conditions, but *now that it has\narisen* it's actually 'here in front of us and is made of matter, it's black, it has a certain weight and it's\nsquare-shaped'.\n800\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAns by John Tan-->-->-->-->\nInstead of \"empty because it *arose* dependent on conditions\", should also contemplate deeply the\nopposite : empty therefore dependent on conditions are possible.\nEnd-->-->-->-->\nBut we're told that the laptop is empty in the sense that it has *never arisen*. What could it mean?\nAns by John Tan-->-->-->-->\nWhen we use the term \"non-arisen\", we are talking about the traditional two truth model so we must look\nat both the ultimate and conventional nature. In ultimate analysis the \"laptop\" is empty and non-arisen;\nconventionally the \"laptop\" arose and the only valid mode of arising is via causes and conditions.\nWe follow the view and its praxis until the nature of mind and phenomena is clearly understood\nanalytically. Until gnosis (prajna) is able to intuitive emptiness free from extremes/conceptualities/all\nelaborations.\nTake note that the path of non affirmative negation is only part of the story and to Mipham without\nseeing coalescence of appearance and emptiness, it is considered notional emptiness. He presents the\n4 stages of Madhyamaka experiences as emptiness --> coalescence --> lack of elaborations --> equality.\nIt is a gradual approach where the insight and experience of former phase will form the foundation for\nthe next phase to arise until the non-conceptual gnosis of spontaneous presence is realized.\nWhat lies after is the pure, unfabricated, uncontrieved view of spontaneous presence which is\ninexpressible since it is beyond all notions and elaborations.\nI think these 4 phases are extremely helpful pointers for ATR people post anatta insight. Before that, the\nnature of mind and phenomena is still unclear. For you, the insights and experiences are there but the\nview is still very weak and needs lots of refinement. This is not your fault, me included ( ) as we start\nfrom koan and contemplate on short stanzas. However if you want to have firmed and stable progress,\nyou got to keep refining your view.\nEnd-->-->-->-->\nI don't fully understand non-arising yet, but I'd say it means that the laptop isn't actually solid or made of\nmatter, even as it's resting right in front of us and we touch it. If it was actually made of matter, then it\nwouldn't be empty - it would have an intrinsic characteristic. But we're told in the Heart Sutra that 'form is\nemptiness'. So, form itself is devoid of nature, so it isn't truly form - it only appears so. And if the form\nelement is empty, no object can possess it as an intrinsic characteristic.\nSince mind and matter originates in dependence, investigated mind instead of matter. Emptiness without\n801\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nMoreover, the laptop being material depends on being perceived by a non-material consciousness, so its\nmateriality doesn't stand alone; it must be cognized externally as to be established - it's not self-\nestablished. The same with its being square or 'in front of us'. Likewise, consciousness does not stand\nalone - it requires the laptop so as to be able to 'arise as perception of laptop'.\nAns by John Tan-->-->-->-->\nOne point to take note here is when Nagarjuna talked about dependency, it is not just nominal\ndependency but also existential dependency. Like the comment I made on Andre previous post:-\nThis undeniable conviction of \"in here\" is real and \"undeniably exist\" WITHOUT conceptual constructs is\nthe \"inherentness\" that must be deconstructed. For without \"externality\", how does the sense of\n\"internality\" arise? If they are dependent, how could they exist truly?\nThe seeing through of their dependent designations also renders the seeing through of their existence.\nEnd-->-->-->-->\nThat the laptop is square-shaped is a notion imputed onto the vivid clarity of experience. That it's black\nlikewise; that it's out there too.\nAns by John Tan-->-->-->-->\nVivid clarity isn't within the scope of mmk. However Mipham has two models of two truth, one is the\ntraditional madhyamaka 2 truth model and second is the authentic(non-dual non-inherent non-\nconceptual)/inauthentic experiential model. Andre's previous poem of equating DO with spontaneous\npresence belongs more to the second model.\n-->-->-->-->\nI think the point is to empty all appearances of any notion that we might want to impute on them. Why? It\nreduces grasping and thus suffering. And, importantly, it opens the door to the transformation of\nexperience. We're told that, in full enlightenment, experience sheds off its 'mortal skin' of ordinary body-\nmind and transforms into enlightened bodies and wisdom. That can't happen if experience is framed in\nconfined structures of subject and object, mind and matter, limited and unlimited, space and time, etc.\nWe can't wake up from a dream while still believing some aspects of it to be real, even if we've seen\nthrough the dream-character and some parts of the landscape.\nAns by John Tan-->-->-->-->\nRelating grasping and suffering to imputations is more than a matter of logical deduction.\nWe can deduced by asking:\nhow does the mind grasp at all when conditioned existence are seen through?\n802\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nHow does mind grasp when it is free from all fabricated notions and elaborations?\nWe may also conclude that in fact mind comes to a total cessation when it's free from all elaborations.\nBut from practice point of view (imo), we must be thoroughly convinced and taste through experience\nthat each conceptual construct has a set of emotional weights associated with it. Be it \"self\",\n\"phenomena\", \"arising\", \"production\", \"existence\" ...etc. Some releases are as powerful as anatta and\nmind-body dropped, some are like putting down a heavy load and often accompanied by a light sense of\njoy. This point was very well described and articulated by Aditya Prasad.\n-->-->-->-->\n\"Don't try to bend the spoon, it's impossible. Instead, realize the truth. What truth? There is no spoon.\"\nAns by John Tan-->-->-->-->\nTell Andre to eat his food with his \"spoon\"!\n-->-->-->-->\nLabels: Emptiness, John Tan, Madhyamaka, Mipham Rinpoche |”\nJohn Tan said:\n“Mipham has very high regards on Tsongkhapa and said clearly that Tsongkhapa is clear about freedom\nfrom all elaborations and coalescence but Tsongkhapa followers may not. Take note that freedom from\nall elaborations is nothing new to Tsongkhapa, in his early years he did accept freedom from extremes =\nfreedom from all elaborations but only rejected it in his later years. Tsongkhapa is an extremely insightful\nand realized master, why did he do that? What has he realized that we failed to see? I definitely think it is\nworth exploring.\nYou see Tibetan scholars have this bad habit of first stereotyping and then follow up with strawman\nattacks to illustrate certain points. I have no idea why they have to do that . The svatantrika-\nprasangika is one, Heshang Moheyan another (we know zen is nothing about promoting a blank state of\nmind). So when studying to refine our view, simply focus on the insightful points of what they are trying\nto convey; you can leave out the colorful sectarian polemics.\nIn ATR, anatta as experiential insight of seeing through \"self\" relinquishing the imagined, the layer\nobscuring and dualifying vivid appearances is gone, experience turns vivid, clear, non conceptual, non-\ndual, spacious and uncontrieved. This is the experiential taste and authentic model that Mipham is\ntalking about.\nHowever can you bring the same insight to all other phenomena and all other conceptual notions? you\nmay think \"That is exactly what vase empty of vase mean!\". you may think you have understood but until\nyou come face to face with mmk, you realized there are still so many subtle nuances of inherentness\nlingering deep in us. The mind is so deeply conditioned that even prolong period of non-dual, non-\n803\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nconceptual opening cannot effectively clear up all these subtle cognitive obscurations and discovering\ntheir relationships with the associated emotional obscurations is never ending as long as we are still in\nthe journey. This is where a lil spice on the analytical part helps to open up the conceptual mind. So it is\na balance imo.\nI like Mipham as it is in line with ATR phases of insights but when I read Tsongkhapa, I also feel the beauty\nof his teachings. Understanding conventionalities is like the imprint of the footstep (convention)\nrelinquishes with each step taken; in the end, there is no path and no steps. And in the end whatever\nlearn about the conventional and its ultimate nature just naturally dissolve into a single taste, conceptual\nand non-conceptual don't seem to matter anymore.\nAs the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra says,\nThe fabricated realm and the definitive ultimate\nAre defined by the lack of sameness or difference.\nWhoever imagines them to be the same or different\nIs possessed of mistaken imagination.\nBut I m not sure whether that is the intent of Tsongkhapa but everyone's condition is different. This is\nhow I feel it.”\n“Hi Tao, the 2 stanzas of seeing through self/Self led to the direct face to face authentication of mere\nappearances as one's radiance clarity and accompanying the anatta insight are these following\nexperiences and realisations:\n1. Non-conceptual\n2. Non-dual\n3. Non-inherent-ness\n4. Coalescence emptiness and appearance\n5. Purity and equality\n6. Direct authentication of one's clarity as the dynamism of mere appearances.\n7. Effortlessness and natural spontaneity\nIn fact all of what Mipham spelled out in the 4 experiences of mmk are all present and more in terms of\ndirect experiential taste but in terms of relinquishing the 2 obscurations it is still inadequate imo.\nWhy?\nBecause the flaw logic of \"inherent-ness\" is not thoroughly seen through from all angles and depth of the\nunion of emptiness and dependent arising has not been fully understood by the conceptual mind that\nrest upon a paradigm of \"inherent-ness and duality\". This point that sutra and tantra compliment each\nother is emphasized by Mipham which is unique and crucial imo.\nSometimes it is good and advisable to step backward and look. A backward step does not necessarily\nmean retrogression; contrary it can make one see much more clearly. Imo what ATR lacks is the missing\ndots that link the 2 stanzas through mmk analysis in which I m too lazy to write...haha ”\n804\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n\"André A. Pais:\nttSp2honnsorred ·\nIt's interesting to think how samsara can be theoretically defeated with the use of a single phrase, like the\nreasonings of 'neither one nor many', the 'diamond slivers', and dependent origination. Nothing\nwhatsoever supposedly survives the serious application of those reasonings.\nFor example, the Lord of Death, huge as a mountain, dark as the night, could come and say to me, \"I'm\ngoing to throw you into the deepest hell, and then into unsurpassable oblivion.\"\nI then could say, \"I see. But you, O Mighty One, the Master of All Things Dreadful, are you singular or\nmultiple, are you one or many? If you're one, where exactly are you? If you're many, who are you then?\nAnd I, the poor being that will suffer such destinies, have I arisen from self, others, both or causelessly? If\narisen from self, that's just pointless and endless; from others, it's illogical and leading to randomness;\nfrom both, it's just double nonsense; and causelessly, it's equally illogical and leading to randomness.\nConcerning that Unsurpassable Oblivion you mentioned, is it created or independently existing?

A commentary need only\nclarify what the root text is actually saying, because it was often cryptic to save words and fit the\nmeter. For instance Candrakirti wrote a commentary on MMK, and also his own text explaining\nMadhyamaka. I think Siderits is an exemplary commentary, and for an explanation I go to\nWesterhoff.\n4 · 1d\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAuthor\nJT said ”In terms of ranking, I prefer Jan Westerhoff, Garfield then Siderits. Like what Tyler said\nSiderits is more of clarifying what the root text is saying, his presentation is quite structured in\npoint forms and the settings behind the text and opponent views help readers understand the\nroot text better. Westerhoff went far beyond and many points are related to anatta insight but\nmore from the philosophical angle. But what all these books lack is how it can help one\nbreakthrough conceptualities, what exactly is mmk trying to arrive at. After studying mmk, how\ndoes it help in freeing our mind?”\n4\nTyler Jones\nThere are a couple of things I really like about Westerhoff. The first is that his \"Western\nphilosophy\" style exposition makes it easier for me to grasp the subtle points than the\nexplanations by shedra trained khenpos/geshes that I have seen. I have the same praise for\nGarfield. The second is that he incorporates Tsongkhapa's illuminating philosophical insights on\nvarious points without being a fully Gelug presentation, which is what Garfield gives.\n“John TanMonday, February 9, 2015 at 9:46am UTC+08\njay garfield is about mmk, you should read commentaries from both gelug and other systems.

Mipham comments are very good and\ncan be used as representative for the other line of thoughts (non-gelug) without skewing to extremes and\nallow us to understand the wisdom of appearances.

What could it mean?\nAns by John Tan -->-->-->-->\nWhen we use the term \"non-arisen\", we are talking about the traditional two truth model so we must look\nat both the ultimate and conventional nature. In ultimate analysis the \"laptop\" is empty and non-arisen;\nconventionally the \"laptop\" arose and the only valid mode of arising is via causes and conditions.\nWe follow the view and its praxis until the nature of mind and phenomena is clearly understood\nanalytically. Until gnosis (prajna) is able to intuitive emptiness free from extremes/conceptualities/all\nelaborations.\nTake note that the path of non affirmative negation is only part of the story and to Mipham without\nseeing coalescence of appearance and emptiness, it is considered notional emptiness. He presents the 4\nstages of Madhyamaka experiences as emptiness --> coalescence --> lack of elaborations --> equality.\nIt is a gradual approach where the insight and experience of former phase will form the foundation for\nthe next phase to arise until the non-conceptual gnosis of spontaneous presence is realized.\nWhat lies after is the pure, unfabricated, uncontrieved view of spontaneous presence which is\ninexpressible since it is beyond all notions and elaborations.\nI think these 4 phases are extremely helpful pointers for ATR people post anatta insight. Before that, the\nnature of mind and phenomena is still unclear. For you, the insights and experiences are there but the\nview is still very weak and needs lots of refinement. This is not your fault, me included (🤣) as we start\nfrom koan and contemplate on short stanzas. However if you want to have firmed and stable progress,\nyou got to keep refining your view.\n814\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nEnd-->-->-->-->\nI don't fully understand non-arising yet, but I'd say it means that the laptop isn't actually solid or made of\nmatter, even as it's resting right in front of us and we touch it. If it was actually made of matter, then it\nwouldn't be empty - it would have an intrinsic characteristic. But we're told in the Heart Sutra that 'form is\nemptiness'. So, form itself is devoid of nature, so it isn't truly form - it only appears so. And if the form\nelement is empty, no object can possess it as an intrinsic characteristic.\nSince mind and matter originates in dependence, investigated mind instead of matter. Emptiness without\nMoreover, the laptop being material depends on being perceived by a non-material consciousness, so its\nmateriality doesn't stand alone; it must be cognized externally as to be established - it's not self-\nestablished. The same with its being square or 'in front of us'. Likewise, consciousness does not stand\nalone - it requires the laptop so as to be able to 'arise as perception of laptop'.\nAns by John Tan -->-->-->-->\nOne point to take note here is when Nagarjuna talked about dependency, it is not just nominal\ndependency but also existential dependency. Like the comment I made on Andre previous post:-\nThis undeniable conviction of \"in here\" is real and \"undeniably exist\" WITHOUT conceptual constructs is\nthe \"inherentness\" that must be deconstructed. For without \"externality\", how does the sense of\n\"internality\" arise? If they are dependent, how could they exist truly?\nThe seeing through of their dependent designations also renders the seeing through of their existence.\nEnd-->-->-->-->\nThat the laptop is square-shaped is a notion imputed onto the vivid clarity of experience. That it's black\nlikewise; that it's out there too.\nAns by John Tan -->-->-->-->\nVivid clarity isn't within the scope of mmk. However Mipham has two models of two truth, one is the\ntraditional madhyamaka 2 truth model and second is the authentic(non-dual non-inherent non-\n815\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nconceptual)/inauthentic experiential model. Andre's previous poem of equating DO with spontaneous\npresence belongs more to the second model.\n-->-->-->-->\nI think the point is to empty all appearances of any notion that we might want to impute on them. Why? It\nreduces grasping and thus suffering. And, importantly, it opens the door to the transformation of\nexperience. We're told that, in full enlightenment, experience sheds off its 'mortal skin' of ordinary body-\nmind and transforms into enlightened bodies and wisdom. That can't happen if experience is framed in\nconfined structures of subject and object, mind and matter, limited and unlimited, space and time, etc.\nWe can't wake up from a dream while still believing some aspects of it to be real, even if we've seen\nthrough the dream-character and some parts of the landscape.\nAns by John Tan -->-->-->-->\nRelating grasping and suffering to imputations is more than a matter of logical deduction.\nWe can deduced by asking:\nhow does the mind grasp at all when conditioned existence are seen through?\nHow does mind grasp when it is free from all fabricated notions and elaborations?\nWe may also conclude that in fact mind comes to a total cessation when it's free from all elaborations.\nBut from practice point of view (imo), we must be thoroughly convinced and taste through experience\nthat each conceptual construct has a set of emotional weights associated with it. Be it \"self\",\n\"phenomena\", \"arising\", \"production\", \"existence\" ...etc. Some releases are as powerful as anatta and\nmind-body dropped, some are like putting down a heavy load and often accompanied by a light sense of\njoy.

Its nature is just like chariot.\nSuch a form is only merely designated and appearing in dependence on all those factors.. have no real\nexistence of its own, not truly originated, coming or going\nIt is not arising or truly existent, it is also not non existent or totally nonarising, but rather it is phenomena\nthat is free from existence or nonexistence or inherent production but dependently originating\nIt is also not about it being dreamlike or merely appearing, rather it is about the essencelessness of\ndependent origination\n[8:50 PM, 6/14/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Therefore to truly comprehend the nature of form is to comprehend its\ndependent origination and emptiness simultaneously\n[8:51 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: Because of the sutra?\n[8:51 PM, 6/14/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Was contemplating just now and occurred to me\n819\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[8:52 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: What about your experience?\n[8:54 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: What about the spontaneous display when expressed conventionally is\nDO and emptiness.

How do you\nrelate convention and the ultimate?\n[9:03 PM, 6/14/2020] Soh Wei Yu: The spontaneous display is what i had in mind when i say nature of\nform is dependently originating and empty.. the vivid vision of red flower is not located inside the flower,\nin the eye, in anywhere.. it is not truly arisen but is a vivid presence that is free of extremes and\nexpressed conventionally as DO\nAll phenomena are conventionally dependently originating, ultimately empty clarity free from extremes\n[9:10 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: Quite good.\n[9:15 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: Try not to be too intellectual now, feel everything with your whole body\nmind naturally.\n[9:17 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: Don't feel with your head or your eyes...lol. feel with your whole body.\nThat is your mind too. ”\n“[11:33 PM, 6/14/2020] Soh Wei Yu: i think mmk is a little confusing to navigate to treat it like a koan..\nanatta is very simple because its just bahiya sutta, or two stanzas, more focused lol\n[11:33 PM, 6/14/2020] Soh Wei Yu: mmk has like so many reasonings\n[11:33 PM, 6/14/2020] Soh Wei Yu: dunno what to focus on\n[11:34 PM, 6/14/2020] John Tan: Yes.

Ingram wrote in http://dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/discussion/-\n/message_boards/message/4179363\nIt is interesting that in another thread the was the assertion that MCTB whatever was about the first\nmeaning of emptiness, rather than what your quote defines as both.\nJust to be clear:\nWhen I mean empty, I also mean without boundary, without inside and outside\nI also mean the direct immediate experience in its unprocessed or raw form. I also mean the total\ndissolution of the sense of a perceiver.\nI also mean no active agent.\nI also mean that nothing is stable, including space and time.\nI also mean that all is bare, shifting, empty sensate experience, causal, happening according to the basic\nlaws of the universe, naturally, on its own.\n825\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nI also would say that there is no boundary or differentiation between the sense doors at they occur, nor\nbetween body and mind, nor between manifestation and awareness, nor between this and that, beyond\nthose ordinarily used for communication and discriminating function, but these are not the essential\nnature of experience, just part of it as sensations when they occur.\nNor can one find any here that is stable, nor a now that is stable, nor a knower, nor an investigator, nor\nany practitioner, nor any attainer.\nWhen I talk of an integrated transient, natural, causal, luminous experience field, this sounds to me\nexactly like your \"All collapse into a single sphere of natural presence and spontaneous simplicity.\"\nI see no obvious difference either in theory or in actual practice.\nThoughts?\nThusness's comments to AEN:\nHi AEN,\nThose were just some very casual sharing written on the spur of a moment, they were not well thought.\nEmptiness to me has another dimension if you wish to look into it.\nWhen there is not even a single trace of Self/self nor is there any sense of inner/outer division,\nexperiencer and what experienced collapsed...\nAt this moment there is just this vivid beautiful scenery, this bright brilliant world…all self arises\nAt this point…\nClose your eyes....\nVoidness....\nRelax and rest in this all-consuming awaring void, this clear non-dual Awareness standing alone as itself\nand of itself…\nThen shift the focus to the breath…\nJust the sensations of the breath…\n826\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThen the transparent dancing sensations…absolutely no mind, no body, no experiencer/experienced, no\ninner/outer division… borderless and boundless\nEvery moment is great and miraculous…\nThis must become natural to you first.\nThen at this moment of appreciating maha suchness of the breath, the sensations, the entire scenery, the\nentire world…\nUnderstand that they are Empty!\nExperience the magnificence then deeply understand that they are empty but this Emptiness has nothing\nto do with deconstruction nor reification nor do I mean they are simply impermanent. So what is this\nEmptiness I am referring to?\n..............\nOn another occasion Thusness wrote:\nIntelligent Knowingness as permanent… continuous… so many projections into time… so involved in mind\nconceptualities… Deconstruct seer, what happens is just this spontaneously manifested scenery\nDeconstruct body further, you have mind-body drop\nDeconstruct time, there will only be this clear vivid presence of immediacy\nAfter arising insight of anatta, there is only “directness” and simplicity... go beyond conventions and\nconceptuality and recognize this immediate radiance is exactly what is appearing in this instantaneous\nmoment...\nIf you are in need of a view for practice, then embrace the general principle of Dependent Origination that\ndoesn’t entertain who-when-where construct, it will help sever dualistic and inherent propensities.\nOtherwise you will have to go back to the koan I asked you when I first met you in IRC… this moment\nceases as it arises, is this moment arising or ceasing? If you are clear, then further penetrate this total\nexertion of immediacy and realize that though there is vivid appearances, there is nothing here… nothing\nnow… you will never find it!\n....\n827\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAlso:\nIn ignorance, there is hearer hearing sound.\nIn anatta, in hearing, only sound.\nYet sound has no true inherent nature (empty),\nIt is an activity and is that very activity called “hearing”.\nBoth “hearing and sound” are pointing to the same activity.\nOnly when seen to have true existence on either side does confusion arise.\nIn Madhyamaka Emptiness, reification is seen through.\nYet the experiential state of freedom from reification is not expounded.\nHowever one can have a taste of that freedom from arising insight of anatta since anatta is precisely the\nfreedom from reification of Self/self (First fold Emptiness).\nIn anatta, seeing is simply the full scenery, in hearing only sound…\nthus, always only lights, shape, colors, sounds, scents… in clean purity.\nEmptying the object further (second fold) is merely dissolving subtle bond of “externality” that creates the\nappearance of true existence of objects outside. When “externality” is deconstructed, it is effectively a\ndouble confirmation of anatta…\n…innerly coreless and outwardly empty, all appearances are still simply sound, lights, colors and rays\nIn thorough deconstruction, as there is no layer that reifies, there is no conceptuality. Therefore no\ncomplication, no confusion, no stains, no boundaries, no center, no sense of dual..\nno sense of activity…just self arising.\nAll collapse into a single sphere of natural presence and spontaneous simplicity.\nWhatever appears is\nneither here nor now,\nNeither in nor out,\nNeither arises nor ceases,\nIn the same space…\nnon-local, timeless and dimensionless\nSimply present…\nTo Jax:\nThe place where there is no earth, fire, wind, space, water…\nis the place where the earth, fire, wind, space and water kills “You” and fully shines as its own radiance, a\ncomplete taste of itself and fully itself.\nLastly, it is interesting to get know something about Dzogchen however the jargons and tenets are far\nbeyond me.\nJust wrote due to a sudden spurt of interest, nothing intense.\n828\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThanks for all the sharing and exchanges.\nGone!\nThese?\n[2:37 PM, 8/5/2022] John Tan: Yes, I think should add together as they represent the 2 different view of\nemptiness.\n[2:38 PM, 8/5/2022] John Tan: Freedom from all elaborations and freedom from self-nature.\n[2:46 PM, 8/5/2022] John Tan: Ok I edited\nSoh: Yeah i was thinking that way about those two recently also\nThose two articles\n[3:15 PM, 8/5/2022] John Tan: Yeah I included the two.

Actually imo, Mipham's presentation of freedom from all elaborations is \"coalescence\", it\nis just and exactly the actualisation of the non-conceptual insight of freedom from self-nature and it must\nbe understood that way, not just \"non-conceptualities\". Focusing on eliminating conceptualities can be/is\nextremely misleading. However the analytical path will delayed the direct taste of vivid appearances but\nin terms of de-construction, contemplating freedom from self-nature is far deeper and much more\nhelpful imo in freeing and uprooting mind's blindspots.”\nJohn Tan (Thusness): Hi David,\nNot only that it does not last and is insubstantial but it is non-arisen.\nAnatta sees through the self (background) and with that freedom from the layer that obscures, everything\nbecomes magnificently clear and real.\nHowever when we attempt to further deconstruct the foreground appearance, for example, looking\n829\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nclearly at a red flower, where is this \"redness\" of the flower?\nOutside? Inside? My consciousness or Soh's consciousness or dog's consciousness?\nSo clear, vivid and undeniable yet was never truly there. How does what that was \"never truly there\"\ndisappear?\nLikewise for sound. Hit a bell - Tingsss..non-dually clear and undeniable. Where is this crystal clear sound?\nOutside? Inside? Soh's consciousness, Albert's consciousness, dog's consciousness? No one sentient being\nhears the same \"tingsss\"...\nLook at everything around...so vivid and lurid...touch anything...so solid and undeniable...when seen with\nDO, every intrinsic characteristic can never be found despite being fully present!\nSame applies to sensations, colors, shapes, scent, sound, thoughts...all experiences are like that...empty\nand non-arising.\nSo when background self is negated, foreground appearances become magnificently real, it does not\nbecome illusion-like.\nWhat is the actual taste of negating \"A\" from the \"(inherent) existence\" of A?\nOnly when foreground appearances are negated of it's existence, then experience becomes illusion-\nlike...it cannot be otherwise. For everything clearly appears but when seen with the eyes of dependent\narising, it is never truly there...it is just illusion-like (not that it wants to be named that way)\nSeeing dependent arising is amazing!\nWhatever appears is non-arisen; indestructible by being not real and phenomena links without being\n\"connected\".\nEverything simply turns magic!\nGood night!\n4 hrs · Edited · Unlike · 4”\nAfter Dieter Vollmuth had clear realisation of anatta (see: Dieter Vollmuth on Anatta, Part 2), John Tan\ngave the following advice:\n“[7:20 PM, 3/15/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Seems like he [Dieter] is clear about anatta now\n[7:21 PM, 3/15/2020] John Tan: Yes seems so.

However even the aggregates are empty (Heart Sutra). It may sound\nobvious but more often than not, even a practitioner who has matured the anatta experience (as in phase\n5) will miss the essence of it.” - John Tan, 2009, Stage 6 in Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of\nEnlightenment\n“Geovani Geo, recently I know that you been enjoying the ride of openness and taste of lurid\ntransparency of your radiance clarity .\nHowever there are also invaluable lessons in understanding all mere appearances (sensations, colors,\nsmell, taste and sound, thoughts), despite being vividly present are nothing real. This \"unreality\" not only\nhelps to relinquish one's attachment, it can also trigger insights of the indestructible and unborn nature\nof what appears.” – John Tan, 2020\nJohn Tan\nAndré A.

Pais\nWhat moment..??\n2 · 16h John Tan\nThe mind loves to squeeze all the wondrous vivid colours, sounds and tastes into a conceptualised \"single\nmoment\" and makes it \"arise\" and \"cease\". The spring does not become summer and summer does not\ncome and go.\n831\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n2\nJohn Tan\nThat said André, imo real wisdom is an embodied wisdom. Without entanglement, the freedom will not\nbe fully tasted and understood. Freedom and entanglement are not two, nor are they one.\nSo taste the freedom (from extremes) by being fully engaged in this complex conventional world. Hence\nsee the \"moment\", see the \"arising\", see the \"ceasing\" but also see their dependent arising (designation)\nand their emptiness.\n9\n“André, to me anatta is a very specific and definite phase of seeing through the background self/Self quite\nthoroughly at least in the waking state but there is a tendency that experience can somehow turn very\n\"physical, sense-based and causal\" for me.\nEvery experience is direct, gapless, non-dual, non-conceptual and radiance even total exertion is present,\njust not empty. Almost equivalent to Actual Freedom as narrated by Richard. In fact I find Richard's\ndescription very much my version of arahat .\nFor Kyle, due to his view in emptiness, the experiential insight of anatta not only pierce through the self/Self\nbut also triggered the arising insight of emptiness. However this may not be true (imo) in most cases if\none's view isn't firmly established. For me when I first encountered the chariot analogy, there is an\nimmediate and intuitive recognition that it is referring to anatta but I am unable to grasp the essence of the\nphrase \"emptiness and non-arisen\" there and then.\nIn other words, in addition to self immolation, a specific insight must arise, it is the prajna that clearly sees\nthrough the referent is empty and non-arisen. So anatta I would say is about severing the self/Self whereas\nphase 6 is the blossoming of this specific insight. Extending this insight from self to phenomena, from\nconventions to magical appearances is then a natural progression.\nAs for first bhumi (Soh: related: [insight] [buddhism] A reconsideration of the meaning of \"Stream-Entry\"\nconsidering the data points of both pragmatic Dharma and traditional Buddhism , Definition of First Bhumi) I am\nseriously not sure and never thought of it.\nI can only say if we practice long enough, there is a frequent occurrence of a clear, clean and pure spring\nof joy that emerges from nowhere, floating like cloud. A very helpful antidote for negative emotions.\nEven the experience of drinking water is like experiencing a clean and pure stream of luminous sensations\nin zero dimension similar to a mirage flowing spring water floating in the air.” - John Tan in the Awakening\nto Reality Discussion Group, 2019, John wrote this maybe a month or two before a breakthrough that Soh\n832\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nhad which led to the writing “The Magical Fairytale-like Wonderland and Paradise of this Verdant Earth Free\nfrom Affective Emotions, Reactions and Sufferings”\n“It is very difficult to understand clarity from emptiness and DO perspective. Most understand it from\nsubstantialist point of view and ended up subsuming.” – John Tan, 2020\n“6/1/2012 8:17 AM: John: You know what is the difference between phase 5 and 6 insights?\n6/1/2012 8:23 AM: John: Does stage 5 understand what that is being said in the YouTube of the water and\nh2o? (h2o: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q80MfH7xPPE )\n6/1/2012 8:27 AM: John: About the essence of emptiness and DO [dependent originatio]. Phase 5 do not\nhave this insight. That is what you fail to clearly understand and tell me. Be clear and understand the\ndifference before going further.”\n“5/21/2012 11:47 AM: John: Imo View is very important. I wrote a poem about uncontrivance last time.\nWithout view it is not easy to penetrate the depth of uncontrivance through experience alone\n5/21/2012 11:48 AM: John: The insight of anatta tells you how to get into direct and immediate recognition\nof effortless non-dual is an example\n5/21/2012 11:53 AM: John: You have to undergo the phases of insights to know the importance\n5/21/2012 11:54 AM: John: Through direct realization and experience alone is difficult even to have the\ninsight of anatta, much less 2 fold emptiness\n5/21/2012 11:57 AM: John: There are the very diligent students who practice faithfully according to anatta\nbut is unable to penetrate the essence of emptiness. Means they realized and directly experienced\nanatta, in seeing just the seen and no-self anatta is clear. Just aggregates and no-self/Self\n5/21/2012 12:01 PM: John: But they are unable to realize the truth that self is a label propelled by the\ntendencies of wrong view so they are unable to see the same \"emptiness\" view of self is also applied to\nwhatever arises. These group of practitioners penetrate anatta and skewed towards experience but fail to\nstrike a balance before the breadth and depth of the view is realized. Therefore what I want is to let you\ndiscover the difference so that you have better understanding of the view, experience and realization.\nYou have to go through the phases and not rely on me too much but pointing is important. Means you\ncan have direct experience of in seeing just the seen and clearly see the Essence of the 2 stanza yet not\nunderstand that self is a mere convention and convenient label. You will simply hold on to that\nexperience and realization like the Theravada and get stuck there.”\n“5/21/2012 3:13 PM: John: Realizing that self is simply a convenient label and applies to all phenomena is\ndifferent from clearly seeing there is no one behind aggregates. This also means that you didn’t really\nundergo a period of desync between view and experience and therefore cannot clearly understand the\nimportance and implications. Means you are fortunate enough to have direct experience with the help of\nthe view. But you have not gone through the process of dropping all views and concepts in an early stage\nof practice to know its harm.”\n833\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“The nonexistence of the personal self was taught for the sake of the Shravakas and Pratyeka-buddhas.\nBy contrast, the nonexistence of both the phenomenal and the personal self was set forth to enable\nBodhisattvas to attain the wisdom of omniscience. It is true that the Shravakas and the Pratyekabuddhas\nunderstand dependent arising, the mere conditionedness of phenomena, but they do not meditate on\nthe complete nonexistence of the phenomenal self. They concentrate instead on the complete\nnonexistence of the personal self as a means to eliminate the emotional afflictions experienced in the\nthree worlds of samsara.” - Chandrakirti, quoted from the book Introduction to the Middle Way:\nChandrakirti’s Madhyamakavatara with Commentary by Jamgon Mipham\n“Examination of the Five Aggregates\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/dharmadepository/translations/examination-of-the-five-aggregates\nThis is a line by line translation of the Huayan Patriarch Cheng'guan's work.\n五蘊觀\nExamination of the Five Aggregates\n沙門澄觀述\nWritten by Śramaṇa Chéngguān\n問。凡夫之人欲求解脫。當云何修。\nIt is asked, “The common person seeks liberation. How should he practise?”\n答曰。當修二觀。\nWe respond saying that one should practise the two examinations.\n二觀者何。一人空觀。二法空觀。\nWhat are the two examinations? The first is the examination of the emptiness of persons. The second is\nthe examination of the emptiness of phenomena (dharma).\n夫生死之本莫過人法二執。\nThe root of birth and death – nothing goes beyond the two attachments of persons and phenomena.\n迷身心總相。故執人我為實有。\nOne misunderstands the body and mind's characteristic of totality and thus grasps the self of the person\nas an actual existent.\n迷五蘊自相。故計法我為實有。\nOne misunderstands the five aggregates' individual characteristics and thus conceives the self of a\nphenomenon as an actual existent.\n計人我者。用初觀照之。\nFor the conception of the self of person we utilize the first examination and investigate it.\n知五蘊和合假名為人。\n834\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWe then know the five aggregates come together and are provisionally called a person.\n一一諦觀。但見五蘊。求人我相終不可得。\nEach are carefully examined. We only see the five aggregates. We seek out the self-characteristic of the\nperson and in the end it cannot be found.\n云何名為五蘊。色受想行識是。\nWhat are called the five aggregates? They are form (rūpa), sensation (vedanā), perception (saṃjñā),\nvolitional formations (saṃskāra) and consciousness (vijñāna).\n云何觀之。\nHow does one examine them?\n身則色蘊。所謂地水火風是。其相如何。\nThe body is the aggregate of form. This is said to be earth, water, fire and wind. What are their\ncharacteristics?\n堅則地。潤則水。煖則火。動則風。\nSolidity is earth. Moistness is water. Warmth is fire. Movement is wind.\n觀心則四蘊。所謂受想行識是。其相如何。\nIn examining the mind there are four aggregates. These are said to be sensation, perception, volitional\nformations and consciousness. What are their characteristics?\n領納為受。取相為相。造作為行。了別為識。\nFeeling is sensation. Apprehending characteristics is perception. Creating actions is volitional formations.\nCognition is consciousness.\n若能依此身心相。諦觀分明。於一切處但見五蘊。求人我相終不可得。\nIf we rely on these characteristics of body and mind, carefully examine and see clearly, then in all places\nwe only see the five aggregates. We search out the self-characteristic of the person and in the end it\ncannot be found.\n名人空觀。乘此觀。行出分段生死。永處涅槃。名二乘解脫。\nWe call this the examination of the emptiness of persons. If one utilizes this examination then one\ndeparts birth and death within the six realms and forever abides in nirvāṇa. We call this the liberation of\nthe two vehicles.\n計法我者用後觀照之。知一一蘊皆從緣生。都無自性。求蘊相不可得。則五蘊皆空。\nFor the conception of the self of a phenomenon we utilize the later examination and investigate it. We\nthen know that each of the aggregates all arise from conditions and all are without self-essence. We seek\nout the characteristics of the aggregates and they cannot be found and so the five aggregates are all\nempty.\n名法空觀。若二觀雙照。了人我法我。畢竟空無所有。\nWe call this the examination of the emptiness of phenomena. If we investigate with both examinations we\nunderstand the person's self and the phenomenon's self are ultimately empty without existence.\n離諸怖畏。度一切苦厄。出變易生死。名究竟解脫。\n835\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nFree from all fears, crossing over all pains and emerging into existence as a Bodhisattva – we call this\nultimate liberation.\n問。夫求解脫。祗是了妄證真。但能契真如理。寂然無念則便離縛。何假興心觀蘊方求解脫。豈不乖理哉。\nIt is asked, “Seeking liberation is only just understanding delusion and realizing the truth. It is merely\nbeing able to realize the principle of tathātā – in quietude without thoughts and then binds are removed.\nHow does one provisionally arouse the mind, examine the aggregates and then seek liberation? Is this not\nin opposition to the principle?”\n答。離蘊真妄約何而立。且五蘊者身心之異名。行人若不識身心真妄。何能懸契。\nWe answer: with what do you stand without aggregates, truth and delusion? For the moment the five\naggregates are a different name for the body and mind. Supposing the practitioner is not aware of the\ntruth and delusions of body and mind, how could they completely understand them?\n不達真妄之本。諸行徒施。\nThey do not reach the source of truth and delusion and practises are vainly undertaken.\n故經云。若於虗空終不能成。斯之謂也。\nThus the scripture states, “It is like in emptiness ultimately nothing being able to be established.”\n且計人我者。凡夫之執也。計法我者。二乘之滯也。\nThe conception of the self of the person is a delusional attachment of the ordinary person. The\nconception of the self of a phenomenon is a hindrance of the two vehicles.\n故令修二觀。方能了妄證真。豈可離也。\nThus we have them practice the two examinations and then they are able to understand delusion and\nrealize the truth. How could you do without this?\nLabels: Anatta, Dependent Origination, Emptiness, Huayan 0 comments | | “\n“In Buddhism, though it is understood as all manifestations are but mind, the focus is not [on] mind, it is\n[on] the nature of this mind.

So one must realize the fundamental issue because phenomena seem so solid, real\nand objective. The Awareness teaching on the other hand errs towards the other extreme of subsuming\nwhich has the same root of ignorance as assuming a true and objective world out there.”\n“Mahamati: How did the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas abandon the view of an absolute arising, dwelling,\nor dissolving?\n[Buddha]: They abandoned it in this manner. They cognized that all phenomena are like an ephemeral\nillusion and dream, that they are detached from the duality of self and others, and that they are therefore\nunborn [emptiness.] They focused on the mind's manifestations and cognized external reality as unreal.\nBy perceiving the unreality of phenomena, they brought about the cessation of the outflowing sensory\nconsciousness. Because they cognized the unreality of their psychosomatic aggregates and the\ninteracting conditions of the three planes of cosmic existence as originating from their deluded mind,\nthey saw external and internal phenomena as devoid of any inherent nature and as transcending all\nconcepts. Having abandoned the view of an absolute arising [of phenomena,] they realized the illusory\nnature and thereby attained insight into the unborn Dharma [expanse of emptiness.]” - Lankavatara Sutra\n“The empty [truth of emptiness] is the emptiness of the conventions.

It is pointing to\nthe nature of what appears… to allow the mind to conceptually understand what is it like… to get the\nmind [to] familiarise so that when you directly taste what appears, insight to the nature of what appears\ncan be directly recognized. If the objects and subject were to truly exists, experience will not be like that.\nThe colors, sound, thoughts, smell, sensations, taste will not be like that.

That which is ungraspable in grasses and\ntrees, wind and water, accordingly, is Mind.

We can\nunderstand emptiness in a manner like 'weather', where weather is merely an imputation upon a\ncollection of phenomena like rain falling, sun shining, and so on. But we can understand this in terms of\nthe emptiness of the imputed label, leaving the collection, the aggregates, the very manifest vivid\nexperience \"un-emptied\". Actually if we truly realized in direct realization how 'chariot' applies as vivid\nappearing presence, then that covers all. As John Tan told me before, \"Don't keep thinking of aggregates\nas also empty, if you understand chariot is empty, what is not empty?\" However the problem is that the\naggregates do appear real unless we've had direct realization that the 'name-only' or 'empty' is actually\nvivid appearing presence.\nThe label or chariot that is empty is the vivid appearing presence, unfindable shimmering vivid like\nmirage.. not mental label. That vivid appearing presence is what is empty just like chariot is empty of\n842\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nitself. This means that one must be able to directly link \"empty\" with vivid appearances. Instead of empty\nas empty of essence, empty = vivid appearances.\nIf we think of a label \"chariot\" and then think \"that labelled chariot is empty of essence\", that is not\ndirectly experiencing chariot as vivid presence. If we think 'chariot/weather/etc' is empty because of this\nand that, it is still inferential analysis rather than direct realisation and actualization. However, when one\nrealizes that chariot = vivid appearing presence, it is a direct experiential insight. Empty = this vivid\npresence. All along it is trying to convey this taste and insight. But conceptually it is understood that way,\nempty of essence.\nLike any object you see, a handphone, a table, a car, that vivid presencing is 'chariot' - is vivid unfindable\nappearing presence, hence there is no handphone.. pain is vivid appearing presence, hence there is no\npain. The vividly presencing handphone is the chariot that appears and functions but is empty, the vividly\npresencing pain is the chariot. Being so, there is no chariot, no pain, no suffering, and all that negations in\nHeart Sutra. Heart Sutra even says, \"No forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables or objects of mind\".\nBut when we talk about the \"no\"s, there can have many meanings. What does the \"no\" as a negation\nmean? Certainly it is not referring to non-existence, which is an extreme. And we certainly do\n(conventionally) experience forms, sounds... and so on. Obviously anyone reading this is fully cognizant\nand conscious rather than an inert corpse or a piece of wood. I have seen new Heart Sutra translations\nthat translate 'emptiness' into something like 'empty of independent existence', stressing on how all\nphenomena are empty of a separate, independent being, else they might be stressing on\n‘interdependence’. Although this seems to be a more explanatory and better understanding than ‘nihilistic\nnon-existence’, I would say even that interpretative translation misses the mark, and hence John and I do\nprefer the more accurate and precise translations over the interpretive ones or those that take poetic\nliberties. Furthermore we may think that it is the mentally labelled entities that are empty of self-essence\nbut then we fail to go beyond seeing emptiness on the level of constructs.\nAt the level of direct experiential insight, it is the very unfindability, ungraspability, referencelessness of\nempty-luminosity.. an appearing “absence”. There is no weather not as in weather doesn't exist but is\nsimply vivid empty appearing/presencing.. but it's not just the mentally labelled entity \"weather\" that is\nempty nor is it that weather doesn't exist but the very vivid empty appearing/presencing we call rain\nfalling etc is nothing there, an appearing absence or vivid empty presencing like a rainbow or mirage or\nhologram. Emptiness is none other than form as it is precisely the appearing absence that is empty, is\nemptiness. Appearances are mere shimmerings of light-mirages.. it's just taste of empty presencing\nappearance. So the car I'm looking at, by being like a chariot and mere name is mere shimmering\nluminous light. It is to see that chariot = vivid appearing presence. Whatever's seen, heard, smelled,\nsensed, tasted and thought are unfindable despite the clear display, just like chariot. We don't have to\ndifferentiate inherency and non-inherency, conceptual or non-conceptual. If you get used to it, whatever\nappears is just empty.\nForm is emptiness, emptiness is form should be understood in this way... taste, see, and smell emptiness.\n843\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n2009 conversation with John Tan:\n“(12:20 PM) Thusness: what you see is DO, emptiness and non-dual, your mind is therefore trapped. This\nis how our mind is trapped and prevents the seeing. when we are trapped in non-dual, we can't see\nemptiness. Even when it is clearly mentioned, it can't be seen.\n(12:22 PM) AEN: so what does that mean? :P\n(12:23 PM) Thusness: reality is like an illusion. but not an illusion. it is like a dream but not a dream.\nEverything is a magical display. And everything is mind. :) What does that mean? The mind is always\nwrongly understood. from \"I AM\" to non-dual experience. We cannot understand the truth of this mind\ntherefore we can't see mind. just like you can't see the essence of the article. we have a preconception.\nEverything is mind. And Everything is like a magical display. that is why I said there is no mirror, there is\nonly reflection. the key is to know the nature of mind. to see that everything is reflection, transience\nEverything is Mind is what that must be derived from anatta and emptiness. but we do not know what\n\"everything\" is and what mind is. therefore we cannot 'see' and cannot experience.\nwe cannot see the essence of it. so anatta and emptiness are taught.\nwhat is Everything? it is like magical display, like an illusion. but it is not an illusion. like a dream but not a\ndream which many misunderstood. therefore when we experience sounds, thoughts, see colors, forms,\ndimension and shapes...all is empty like an illusion. like dreams like the 'redness' of a flower. like the\n'selfness'. like the 'hereness'. like the 'nowness', yet empty, nothing real.\nif you can't totally see that pristineness, that non-dual, that luminosity and see only emptiness, you are\nmistaken. the 'redness', the 'nowness', the 'hardness', the coldness, all are as luminous, as clear, as vivid.\nwe must fully experience it. yet they are not real, nothing concrete, no solidity, nothing substantial,\nnothing graspable, no findable.\nEmpty, thus non-dual luminosity and emptiness. we see this union, in all transience,\npassing phenomena, in emotions, in feelings, in thoughts, in sounds, in sight, in color, in dimension, in\nshapes, in taste, in hardness, coldness, in sweetness, in sky, in the sound of chirping bird, all experience\nare like that. empty yet luminous, then we realise that it is the same as mind, it is mind. if we din see\nthese 2 nature of mind thoroughly, we can't see. we distant, we seek, we find. because of its emptiness\nnature, the manifold, we cannot know what mind is. therefore the ground is taught, the view is taught.\nempty yet non-dual luminosity, so that you can see and experience directly that the transience are mind,\nyet there is no self nature, get it?\n(12:38 PM) AEN: think so\n(12:38 PM) Thusness: then you experience what is one taste. Because we do not know what mind is, we\ncannot experience mind. we do not know, that is why insight is important. however if you do not know\nwhat is non-dual luminosity and emptiness, how is a practitioner going to experience mind everywhere\nand know that whatever arises is mind? therefore first anatta (non-dual luminosity), then emptiness, then\n844\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nspontaneous arising. do you understand what I mean? read the article ( On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness,\nMaha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection )”\nAfter reading this passage John Tan commented that Mahamudra clearly is speaking about the same\ninsight as him regarding emptiness/chariot as vivid appearance:\n“If you say that the nature of all thoughts is total voidness without arising or cessation, you take voidness\ntoo literally and fall into the extreme of nihilism. What they are is vividness that leaves no trace; whose\nnature is without arising, cessation, or duration; and which cannot be identified as having this colour, that\nshape, etc.\nIf you realise this much, you have developed a little understanding. Furthermore, you must recognise that\nthey cannot be identified as this or that, and do so without thinking conceptually, \"They cannot be\nidentified as this or that.\" And without any grasping or contradiction in your mind between the vividness\nand the voidness of thoughts, you must recognise that thoughts arise and subside simultaneously, like a\ndrawing on water.\nIn addition, you must gain the insight that there is not the slightest difference in nature between thought\nand its object, between the settled mind and the moving mind, between past mind and present mind, and\nso forth. They are all by nature clear, brilliant awareness.\nWhen you draw a thought in for investigation, or if it disappears, it is not that it has gone into clear\nvoidness, nor that such voidness has been left in its wake. Rather, the thought that arises all of a sudden\nis itself clear voidness. When you realise or gain this insight, then you have recognised the nature of\nthought.\nThere is not even the slightest difference between the non-conceptual state and the state of true insight\ninto the triad of dynamic thought, settled mind, and thought's nature as clear, void, and brilliant. To\ndistinguish between these is an interpolation of the mind that does not recognise them.\n—Wangchug Dorje, 9th Karmapa (1556-1603), \"Mahāmudrā: Eliminating the Darkness of Ignorance\"”\n“Emptiness is like seeing everything is a sandcastle.. a chariot in real life, its seeming aggregation appears\nsolid only when unexamined but really is just an appearing aggregation dependently originating.. it seems\nto arise and come into existence but in truth is just an empty exertion or appearance or aggregation..\nvery vivid but nothing is created. If something were to be created that would mean it is no longer an\naggregation, no longer dependent on parts, conditions, functions, relations, etc.. whatever entity we\ndesignate is purely conventional and empty. Whatever appears as nondual vivid presencing is also of the\nnature chariots and sandcastle, appearing through conditions and aggregation but nothing besides an\nunfindable and vividly shimmering appearance of dependent origination that is equivalent to mirages and\nreflections.. its like what would a hand be without the five fingers exerting? What would a mirror be\nwithout its reflections? The mirror is just the ongoing reflecting, an empty appearance that is empty\n845\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nradiance clarity. Besides these, behind these or within these no mirror could be found. We only ever\nexperience an empty exertion as vivid appearance, but never the origination nor cessation of real entities\nThe seeing of this has everything to do with seeing the chariot like, unfindable nature of presencing and\nnothing to with the notion that everything is dreamed up or projected or things like that\"\n“[6:31 PM, 4/10/2020] John Tan: To me, the only thing that I am interested now is about how one\nunderstands the \"chariot\".”\nAwakening to Reality\nRick Indie · 8h ·\nHey all,\nSo I've been contemplating something but I'm a bit stuck: so on no-self, I've been trying to contemplate\non the body & sense-of-self being an illusion, but this is hard to do when my body is itself solid & can\nbump into (seemingly separate) people. How can this be an illusion if this solidity maintains itself? Soh\nWei Yu is there any writing on how I (the body) can still bump into solid boundaries but still be considered\nan illusion? Thanks for all the work you all do.\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nSelf and solidity of matter are two different constructs. You can realise no-self through the two stanzas,\nsuch that there are no self/Self but only the pure aggregates, but matter still feels solid and concretely\nreal, even if total exertion is experienced, then it is reified into 'actual world' which is physical but vividly\nand intensely luminous and alive, direct and nondual. That is like John Tan's initial experience of anatta\nand is equivalent to the state of Actual Freedom by Richard. In this phase there is no more the sense of\nbeing a soul inhabiting the body (nor the sense of an ultimate and infinite background subsuming\neverything like I AM to one mind), but the body is still materially existent, and is not separate from the\nentire universe, and as such experience is boundless without a center yet not realised as empty or unreal.\nLater on, when you contemplate, you start to realise the world is more like chariot. Everything is still\nintensely vivid but more like a hologram. Even stepping on ground there is not the sense that there are\ntwo solid inherently existing parts interacting but like a mere dependently originating, empty, non-arisen\nand insubstantial luminosity and vividness. Appearance/presence that is vividly luminous has no nature\nlike a mirage and a rainbow. Perhaps 'rainbow body' is the full actualization of this until all traces of\ninherently existing self, body and phenomenal world is exhausted (also known as exhaustion of all\nphenomena).\n• 13m\n• Edited\nSoh Wei Yu\nSomething I wrote years back on chariot https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../emptinesschariot-as...\n846\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAWAKENINGTOREALITY.COM\nEmptiness/Chariot as Vivid Appearing Presence\nEmptiness/Chariot as Vivid Appearing Presence\n• 6m\nSoh Wei Yu\nAlso John Tan wrote some time back\n\"looks like yin ling been enjoying 洪文亮 teaching . Non-dual without sense of perciever or percieved\ncan still be substantial, so there can still be \"one\" -- \"万法归一，一归何处?\". So need to discern this clearly.\nIn other words, subsuming object into pure subjectivity will also result in non-dual experiences, however\nif both object and subject are realized to be empty and non-arisen, then non-dual is freedom from\nextremes.\nWhen the view of empty and non-arisen is actualized daily life, not only conceptual conventions are\nrealized to be empty and non-arisen, but appearances (colors, sound, smell, taste, sensations, thoughts)\nare just like that in real-time taste. Therefore whether conceptual or non-conceptual both share a single\ntaste.\nAnd this is the \"turning point\" post anatta where whatever appears is luminous and free, without center\nwithout base; like cloud, like rainbow; spontaneous and perfect.

It is just the pedagogy. It is also important to point out the idea of\ninherent existence.\nSoh, 2019:\n“Emptiness is the emptiness of conventional phenomena, it does not exist outside phenomena but is\nsimply a way of pointing out that all phenomena are free from the extremes of existence and non-\nexistence. Emptiness does not in itself exist - emptiness is empty. It is not that the concepts of existence\nand nonexistence do not apply because reality is nonconceptual, it is rather that existence simply cannot\nbe found in presencing appearance, its nature is unfindable and empty.\nDependent origination is the way all perceived phenomena arise, they do not arise by itself, other, both or\nwithout causes. And in its arising no arising can be found nor place of arising, nor can any true existence\nbe found. Is it in the mind? Outside the mind? In between? Somewhere? The smell of flower dependently\n850\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\noriginates but is unfindable, not originating anywhere. The redness of rose is not found to exist inside the\nflower, inside the eye, inside the mind, outside, or in between. What dependently originates is empty,\nunfindable, nonarisen like a mirage and reflection.\nBeing this way, phenomena do not truly arise and cannot have its real existence established, all\nphenomena are unfindable and merely appearing like reflections. Directly seeing this to be the nature of\nall appearance-presencing, everything has the taste of non-arisen empty exertion. So the purpose of\ndependent origination and emptiness is to directly realise and recognise the nature of\nmind/presence/appearance, as non arising and free from the extremes of existence and non-existence.\nThere are two levels to this. One is to realise the emptiness of all conventionally constructed entities, to\nfree the mind from the ideas of existence and non-existence but on the conceptual layer. The other level\nis seeing through conventionality and recognise the nature of what appears.\n…\nThere is a very good translation of a paragraph from a dzogchen text by Dzogchen teacher Acarya\nMalcolm Smith but I cant share things out of his group as per his group policy\nBut basically its about the very vivid arising without agent.. like in anatta, appearing but empty and non\narisen, and arising as mere name, without place of arising nor agent of arising\n…\nThat realisation of emptiness will become a recognition of the nature of vividly presencing appearance,\nyou will recognise the taste and nature of all appearance as vividly present yet nothing there, empty, non-\narisen like reflections\nIf this is not recognised then it cannot be helpful in sleep and bardo. It cannot liberate in that state. There\nis no room for inferential analysis in those states\n…\nAs John Tan said back in 2013/2014:\nJohn Tan Hi Kyle, Actually I am saying instead of attempting to deconstruct endlessly, why not resolve that\nthat pure experience itself is empty and non-arising. In hearing, there is only sound. This clear clean and\npure sound, treat and see it as the X (treat and see it like an imputation/conventional designation as you\nexplained), empty and non-arising. In seeing, just scenery, just this clear clean and lurid scenery. Where is\nthis scenery? Inside, outside, other’s mind or our mind? Unfindable but nonetheless appears vibrantly.\n851\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThis arising thought, this dancing sensation, this passing scent, all share the same taste. All experiences\nare like that -- like mirages and rainbows, illusory and non-arising, they are free from the 4 extremes.\nResolve that all experiences are non-arising, then pure sensory experiences and conventional constructs\nwill be of equal taste. Realize this to be the nature of experience and illusory appearances will taste magic\nand vajra (indestructible)! Groundless and naturally releasing! Just my 2 cents of blah blah blah in new\nyear.

So seamless and instantaneous is the \"morphing\", simply miraculous!\nAsk urself again, how is this possible at all if there is essence? Let the insight of \"essencelessness\" permeates ur entire\nbeing and heal all ur clogged up energies.\nThen look at thoughts and conceptualities. See how malleable thoughts and conceptual ideas are and see how they\nfreely manifest. How are all these even possible if there is \"essence\"?\nNext look at dependent arising. How is it possible to even originate in dependence so seamlessly? Feel the\n\"essencelessness\" and feel the \"magic\" and wonder. You must feel \"essencelessness\", not think essencelessness.\nThen you will understand the intent of Nagarjuna. There will be no arguments. You will realize that only because of\n\"essencelessness\" are all these possible. You will understand it is precisely that there is no self-nature, there is causal\nefficacies; because it is dream-like, there is all these vivid appearances and happenings.\nBecause of this, dreams in dreams does not amount to \"nothing\" as Nagarjuna corrected his essentialist opponents in his\nVigrahavyāvartanī. The reason why they think that insubstantial thoughts and dreams amount to nothing because all\nalong they are \"moulded\" to think in a substantial way that only essential things matter.\nOnce you see this, emptiness, dependent arising, causal efficacies, insights and experiences will be a living authentication\nmoment to moment in real-time.

Once we\nexperience Anatta and further realised how conventions fool us, then one can clearly sees, tastes,\ntouches, senses, thinks… whatever appears is nakedly crystal, clean, luminous but empty like\nevanescence mist and non-arisen like mirages. Always already so! This then, in my opinion is the essence\nof the teaching. We are not denying consciousness but directly tasting consciousness every moment.\nWhenever I see dependent origination, I see emptiness and non-arising and taste what is termed pristine\nconsciousness. So I have no issue of [with] two truths. In fact two truths perfectly described my moment\nto moment and non-dual experience.” - John Tan, 2015\n“When the [ultimate] truth is explained as it is, the conventional is not obstructed; Independent of the\nconventional no [ultimate] truth can be found.\"\n- Bodhicittavivaraṇa\n“Queequeg:\nI'm not sure cause and effect as you have in mind applies to the view explained through ichinen sanzen.\n\"Since suffering and its causes do not exist...\" I don't think its any sort of conventional view.

His writings aim to\ninspire and—as a matter of historical fact—did inspire vigorous striving in active virtue.\nTsong- kha- pa insists that rational analysis is an indispensable tool in the spiritual life.

However even the aggregates are empty (Heart Sutra). It may sound\nobvious but more often than not, even a practitioner who has matured the anatta experience (as in phase\n5) will miss the essence of it.\nAs I have said earlier, phase 5 does appear to be final and it is pointless to emphasize anything. Whether\none proceeds further to explore this empty nature of Presence and move into the Maha world of\nsuchness will depend on our conditions.” - John Tan, 2009\n“For Kyle, due to his view in emptiness, the experiential insight of anatta not only pierce through the\nself/Self but also triggered the arising insight of emptiness. However this may not be true (imo) in most\ncases if one's view isn't firmly established. For me when I first encountered the chariot analogy, there is\nan immediate and intuitive recognition that it is referring to anatta but I am unable to grasp the essence\nof the phrase \"emptiness and non-arisen\" there and then.\nIn other words, in addition to self immolation, a specific insight must arise, it is the prajna that clearly sees\nthrough the referent is empty and non-arisen. So anatta I would say is about severing the self/Self\nwhereas phase 6 is the blossoming of this specific insight. Extending this insight from self to phenomena,\nfrom conventions to magical appearances is then a natural progression.” - John Tan, 2019\n“Without anatta and dependent origination, there is no Buddhism. It is the difficulty of understanding\nselflessness and consciousness and still not fall into the stance of neo advaita that is important. Kyle\nseems clearer about this probably due to his direct experience of phenomena after anatta and is able to\nsee how the conventional mind mistakes conventions as real. Real (true existence) is not needed and\nfrom Mūlamadhyamakakārikā we realize it is impossible for manifestation, cause and effect and so on\nand so forth to take place based on such a view. Yet appearances arise. The on going manifestation is\nthen realized to be dependent origination and what dependent origination finally reveals is the non-\narisen and empty nature of mind and phenomena.” - John Tan, 2015\n“Characteristics [of phenomena] are reifications and reifications are themselves attachment” - John Tan,\n2019\n“The conventional is mere designation by mind onto a valid basis of designation. The ultimate is full\nemptiness (a full lack of characterization) of all phenomena. All phenomena lack relationships, identity,\nstructure, characteristics, properties, and an essence.\nWhen the mind draws boundary conditions such as \"this and that have a relationship\" on a valid basis of\ndesignation, then it exists and functions as such. But, from the side of undesignated or unconstructed\n861\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nultimate reality, it is utterly devoid of self-borne identities, characteristics, relationships, and so on.” -\nJared K Jones\n“... emptiness and dependent arising are simply tools to enable us to recognize the nature of mind and\nphenomena. But even post anatta, what exactly is meant by \"freedom\" may not be clear. One can still be\ntrapped and awed by the radiance. In fact when I first met you, I did send you a quote regarding a tibetan\nmaster saying it is the radiance that make us lost in wisdom forum. So instead of realizing the reification\nand characteristics are empty, one focuses on the radiance. But not realizing one's radiance, we can't\nhave clear understanding of DO [Dependent Origination] and emptiness too. It remains as an intellectual\nunderstanding. So it is a fine line.” - John Tan, 2019\n\"A “True experience” is better than a thousand words but it is also the very “true experience” of the\nBrilliance Bright that has blinded Mystics of all ages. The Brilliance Bright is more vivid than we can\nimagine. In All IT is seen and In All IT is experienced. Being vividly bright it also serves as the “condition”\nthat obscures its very own Emptiness nature.\" - John Tan, 2005\n“http://www.rinpoche.com/q&a.htm\nQ: If the nature of mind is this all-pervading, brilliant union of luminosity and emptiness, ungraspable,\nhow is it that it could be obscured, even for a moment, let alone for lifetime after lifetime?\n{Tibetan translation}\nA: Because it's too brilliant, that's the short answer. {laughter} It's like this. Luminous, brilliant emptiness,\nis the nature of mind. And it's been there with us inseparably for beginningless time. But the brilliance is a\nbit too strong. If you take the two, the factor of luminosity and the factor of emptiness, the former one,\nthe factor of luminosity is a bit strong. A bit stronger. And because it's so strong, we don't see the empty\nfactor. We don't see the factor of emptiness. Because of the brilliance of the mind, all these things appear,\nand they look so real, and we get so fascinated with it. {laughter} We're really stuck. We're really stuck on\nthem, and we're confused, and becoming bewildered and confused by them, then we don't realize the\nnature of our minds. We become completely intoxicated with the brilliance and the luminosity, and what\nall of what it displays to us, and we don't see the emptiness.\nNow when Buddhists talk about ignorance, they don't mean some sort of black darkness, just shrouded...\nthey actually mean it's so brilliant. It's so vivid, that we become confused by it. So we have to turn inwards\nand look, and see the emptiness that we've not been seeing, because we've been following after the\nluminosity for so long. Good example is a movie, movie comes on, we know it's just a movie, pretty soon\n{laughter}. We know it's somebody... picture, you know. There's human beings, and there's mountains,\nand there's rivers, and these wildlife and plains, and we're completely drawn to it. And it's just because its\nbrilliance is too strong, that's why we have to turn and look at the emptiness.\n862\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n{Questioner: Wow. Laugher}” - Q&A with Thrangu Rinpoche\n\"The emptiness of all things, however, is not nothingness; it is interdependence. It is the unity or\nsameness of the appearance of something and its emptiness, the unity or sameness of the lucidity or\nvividness of something and its emptiness. When you look at your mind, you do not find anything, and the\nreason you do not find anything is that the mind's nature is emptiness. But the mind is not just empty;\nwhile being empty, its characteristic, its defining characteristic, is awareness. Therefore, when the mind is\ndescribed, terminology like the unity of cognitive lucidity and emptiness or the unity of awareness and\nemptiness is used. Unity here is meant very strongly. The nature of awareness is emptiness, and the\nnature of the mind's emptiness is awareness.\" - Thrangu Rinpoche\n“Emptiness is the 'nature' of all experiences. There is nothing to attain or practice. What we have to realize\nis this empty nature, this ‘ungraspability’, ‘unlocatability’ and ‘interconnectedness’ nature of all vivid\narising. Emptiness will reveal that not only is there no ‘who’ in pristine awareness, there is no ‘where’ and\n‘when’. Be it ‘I’, ‘Here’ or ’Now’, all are simply impressions that dependently originate in accordance with\nthe principle of conditionality.” - John Tan, 2006\n“If we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front us, the “redness” only appears\nto “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species (dogs\ncannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum\neyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found, only\nalmost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are\ndependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or\n“redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances without inherent/objective existence.” - John\nTan, 2009, On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\n“What do you see?\nRight and left brain dominant, if your right brain is dominant, you will see combination of pink and white\ncolor, and if your left brain is dominant, you will see it in gray and green color. Try with your loved ones,\nvery interesting.”\n“Tan Jui Horng, always good to know that what we see is hardly objective, true and real.”\n“Yes. If such direct seeing is hardly objective, much less is our moment to moment of experiences that are\nso clouded by thoughts and concepts.”\n863\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n- John Tan, 2019\n“Someone wrote: This confuses me. A bus is empty of an essence. No bus can be found. But even\nawakened beings with realization of two-fold emptiness, self and world, would still avoid being hit by one.\nEither death would occur, or intense injury & suffering. So, it seems extreme, at least to me, to say there is\nnothing there. Yes, it's without essence, but if you're hit by it, you'll know you were hit by something.\nSoh replied: There is no 'you' being 'hit' by 'something' besides conventionally. Those are all not\nconventionally denied, but emptiness is precisely the lack of inherent existence of conventional\nphenomena and conventional self. Which is to say, self and phenomena do not exist in and of itself with\nessence, and are purely imputed or dependently designated. Mere names. It is not the denial of\nconventional injury and suffering, but if injury and suffering could be found to exist somewhere\n(independent of designation and conditions), that would contradict dependent origination and dependent\ndesignation, and all conventional phenomena including injury and suffering would then be impossible. As\nNagarjuna pointed out, if phenomena truly existed with their own substance or essence, they would be\nunmalleable, permanent, independent of all conditions and therefore its causation or ending could not be\ndiscerned.\nDo note that all of those conditions involved are also dependently designated and empty of its own\nessence. For example you say that seeing depends on eye and visual object, but eye too is designated in\ndependence on seeing and visual object for an eye is not an eye were it to be without the function of\nseeing a visual object, and a visual object would not be a visual object were it not to be perceived in/as a\nvivid visual consciousness via the conditions of the eye faculty. All phenomena do not exist by their own\n864\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nside independent of designating consciousness and dependent designation. This is the teaching of\nNagarjuna and Prajnaparamita - all dharmas, all aggregates, are mere names, mere designations. And as\nJohn Tan wrote before, \"“Mere” and “cannot stand at its own side” are synonym. I suggest you to treat\n“mere” to mean “that it is merely labelled as the emptiness of phenomena is deep and the dependencies\nare profound.”\" In Madhyamika, dependency on imputation is a subtler insight into dependent origination\nthan merely dependency on conditions, and this dependency applies even to unconditioned phenomena\nlike nirvana [the analytical cessation of afflictions and suffering] and space. The 'Sravaka schools' reject\nthe existence of a soul or self and accepts dependency by conditions, however they may posit these\nconditions and arising phenomena to truly arise and have momentary essence, but Madhyamika\nemphasizes that even these causes and conditions and arising phenomena are dependently designated,\nempty and non-arisen. (See the “Causes Dependent on Effect (Two-way Dependency)” in the latter part of this\nchapter)\nFor example: a sun is shining, sun is designated in dependence on sunshine as much as sunshine is\ndesignated in dependence on sun. A sun that does not shine is not a sun. Hence there is no inherently\nexisting sun or inherently existing sunshine, much less an inherently existing sun that precedes and then\ncauses the inherently existing sunshine (therefore as Nagarjuna and Dogen taught - Cause does not\nprecede Effects [they are dependently designated ala Nagarjuna, and totally exerted ala Dogen]) -- they\nare designated in dependence. A mother is not a mother before she has a child, therefore the child\n'makes' the mother a mother as much as a mother 'makes' the child a child. There is no inherently\nexisting mother that existed before the child and produces an inherently existing child. In truth, no\nmother, no child, just the entire situation and exertion of the whole activity at the moment. Experientially\nwhen all conventional phenomena loses their fixed 'inherent' boundaries, it feels like the whole universe\nis seamlessly exerting a given phenomena. You do not only see with your eyes -- your whole body, the\nwhole sky, your entire activity, the whole universe are all involved in that seeing. That is maha total\nexertion. And then when we attempt to find where that phenomena of the seamless exertion exists, we\ndo not find any essence, appearing yet empty like the reflection of moon on lake. That's the -A aspect,\nillusory like reflections, empty and non-arisen. Appearing yet nothing there, like a dependently originating\nand dependently designated \"reflection of the moon on lake\".\nAnd likewise when your 'skin' 'hits' 'the wall’ and therefore there is a 'sensation', can 'hitting' and\n'sensation' be singled out from each other, or from ‘wall’ and 'skin', or are each of these designated in\ndependence, empty, and seamlessly exerted? If skin and wall and hitting and pain all existed in and of\nitself independent of conditions and designation, would it even be possible for the 'hitting' or the\n'sensation of hitting' to take place (conventionally speaking)? Similarly, if sun and sunshine were to have\ntheir own findable essence somewhere, could sun even be a sun and sunshine even be sunshine? For\nwhat is a sun without sunshine and sunshine without sun? Like the chariot analogy, you can't pin down\nthe 'chariot' in any of the parts or besides the parts, chariot is merely designated in dependence on the\nparts, and likewise for 'self' and 'aggregates'. You can't pin down the sun existing somewhere in the\n865\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nsunshine or without and apart the sunshine, but they are mutually and dependently designated. And\nwhat is dependently designated is to be completely empty of some findable essence.\nHence Nagarjuna taught in Mūlamadhyamakakārikā,\n\"Whatever is dependently co-arisen\nThat is explained to be emptiness.\nThat, being a dependent designation\nIs itself the middle way.\nP.229\nSomething that is not dependently arisen,\nSuch a thing does not exist.\nTherefore a non-empty thing\nDoes not exist.\"\nTherefore 'you' 'know' 'you were' 'hit' by 'something' - each of these elements in quotations are purely\nconventional, purely dependently designated, and empty. They are not elements that can be singled out\nas each having their own essence independent of the parts, conditions, functions, and designating\nconsciousness. Just like sun and sunshine. If you try to find the essence of sun or the essence of sunshine,\nyou cannot find any, only seamless and endless dependencies, like moon-reflections or the net of indra.\nAppearing yet unfindable. Empty and non-arisen.\nHere's another analogy:\n“[4/3/19, 11:46:11 PM] John Tan: For the growing process \"seed to plant to tree\"?

It’s dependent on the parts and\ndesignating consciousness\n866\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[5/3/19, 8:46:29 AM] John Tan: So what determine \"growing\"?\n[5/3/19, 8:47:34 AM] Soh Wei Yu: Designating consciousness\n[5/3/19, 8:48:46 AM] John Tan: So is the \"seed to plant to tree\" growing or decaying?\n[5/3/19, 10:20:05 AM] Soh Wei Yu: Both but Only conventionally.. not intrinsically”\nIn this analogy, if growing exists inherently by its own side rather than designated conventionally, then it\ncould be 'findable'. But, it's not...\nAnd although it is not findable, not inherently existing, it is conventionally valid to speak of growing and\ndecaying.” - Soh, 2019\n“A human being is growing up/ageing/dying dependent on conventions, valid from the perspective of\nconventional truth, which means a given phenomenon is accurately observed through unimpaired senses\nand tallies with socially agreed convention.\nAt what point in life is one considered \"getting old\" and not just \"growing up\"? Even a 10 year old child can\nbe considered getting old, but sometimes we say a 70 year old person is getting old. The moment we are\nborn, our terminal condition called life starts and we begin a temporal journey to death. We are dying as\nmuch as we are growing. How we designate a point as growing up and getting old is very much\ndependent on convention, it does not truly exist by its own side.\nAn arising phenomena ceases as soon as it arises, is this moment of phenomena arising, or is it ceasing?\nNo intrinsic arising, abiding or ceasing of any phenomena can be discerned.\nOnly conventionally do we say a phenomena is arising, or ceasing, or growing, or maturing, or ageing, or\ndecaying.” - Soh, 2019\n“In anatta, it is clearly seen that there is no need for any timeless presence other than the appearances\nthemselves.\nIn the consequent school of the gelug, it is clearly understood that there is no need for any foundation\nconsciousness to ground the conventions, there is only groundless conventions. Freedom from marks (no\nmarks) is simply to see the emptiness of the conventional. The import of both are the same, they share the\nsame taste.” - John Tan, 2019\n“There is no question that what exists merely due to the existence of conceptuality and does not exist\nwithout the existence of conceptuality is, like a snake imputed to a coiled rope, to be ascertained as not\nestablished by way of its own entity.\n867\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n~ Chandrakirti”\n“If something exists only if conceptuality, that is, the conceptual consciousness imputing it, exists and this\nthing does not exist if conceptuality does not exist, then it does not inherently exist. However, it is\nundeniable that things do appear to us as if they inherently exist and that, based on this, we conceive them\nto exist inherently.” - Emptiness Yoga: The Tibetan Middle Way\n“[6/3/19, 7:23:00 PM] John Tan: They do not require a ground foundation consciousness, do not seek\npresence, what do they rely on to release?\n[6/3/19, 7:23:52 PM] Soh Wei Yu: The release of the sense of phenomena truly there that can be found\nwhen sought, existing with Essence, by itself or on its own side\n[6/3/19, 7:24:07 PM] Soh Wei Yu: The conventions are seen to be empty\n[6/3/19, 7:24:22 PM] John Tan: ”\nMr. A asked, \"Soh, what's your view on \"other minds\" or \"other experiences\"?\"\nSoh replied, \"The same as \"my mind\" and \"my experience\", which is to say, completely conventional and\ndependently designated by designating consciousness like a chariot, floor, trees, seed, plant, growing,\ndecaying, [everything you can name], and when sought for no referent entity could be found, hence\nultimately empty and non-arisen.\nFor the delusion of inherent existence is precisely this notion that these things - minds, chariots, floor, trees,\nseed, plant, growing, decaying, exists by its own side, where in truth they are merely named and imputed\nin dependence on the parts, conditions, functionality, and importantly - the designating consciousness that\nimputes dependently (and these parts/conditions/functions/designating consciousness/conventions\ninvolved too are mere names, designated in dependence), these entities, agent, action and act, cause and\neffect, objects and characteristics, etc etc.\nKyle Dixon just wrote something in the Mahamudra/Dzogchen group which basically says what I'm saying:\n“My own wife and children are not ultimately real. Yours are not exempt.”\n\"Emptiness does not negate conventions, it reveals that all conventions are merely inferential. They do not\nrefer to substantial entities because those entities cannot be found when sought.\nSubstantial entities, dharmas, i.e., entities which bear characteristics, are figments of delusion.\nThis is why emptiness is taught to be the freedom from the four extremes of existence, non-existence, and\nany combination of the two.\n868\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBecause entities which accord with the extremes of existence and non-existence are mistaken cognitions.\nHence Shantideva states:\n“When an existent or a nonexistent does not exist before the mind, at that time since there is no other\naspect [concepts] are fully pacified as there is no objective support [dmigs pa, ālambana].”\"\nMr. A replied, “For something to be conventionally real, it requires a basis of designation. What's the basis\nof \"other experiences\"? All that is found is \"this experience\", which is a label designated upon current\nappearances.”\nJohn Tan replied, “The basis of designation is not appearances. The basis of designation is still designations.”\nMr. A asked, “what's the designating consciousness that imputes labels?\"\nSoh replied, \"Designating consciousness is the conceptual consciousness that designates, which is to say a\nthought, a designation.\nLike a seed~sprout is \"growing\" or \"decaying\" dependent on designation of consciousness rather than\nexisting by its own side. If it were inherently and objectively existent as the characteristic of objects, then it\nwould be fixed, and there would only be one fixed way of seeing it/things. All phenomena are dependently\ndesignated.\"\n“After anatta there is no background, only taste. But a further realization sees that the taste is empty and\nmerely designated. Floor is designated with no referent. Even to conceive of brown, red, yellow, is\ndependently designated, although they are valid as conventions. When sought for, the referent cannot be\nfound. They are not truly existing by its own side as some findable object to be pinned down. Brown is\nbrown by convention, not an inherently existing attribute of something somewhere to be found.\nAlso you have to see the living perception of solid brown of floor as the convention, not as a verbal word\ndivorced from the perception. That it is to say, the seemingly solidity of floor or brown existing by itself\n“there” is suddenly discovered to be a mere imputation and nowhere to be found at all. By investigating the\nperception of brown or floor or any apparent object in direct perception, it is found to be unfindable and\nmerely designated in dependence rather than existing by own character or own side. The point is not to\nthink of the word “brown” and then say that’s empty, but discover the very solidity and inherency of\nforeground aggregates in anatta to be empty and nonarisen so that the nature of presencing is realized to\nbe its non-arising and emptiness. Then it becomes a taste of appearance-emptiness, illusory like moon-\nreflections and mirages, appearing but nothing there. Then appearances auto refute existence by its\nappearance, and those appearances never amounts to anything arising or any kind of substantial entity,\nsuch that they are automatically seen to not be anything existing by its own side.\n869\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nTherefore it is not verbal words we are negating but the very inherency of the aggregates even in direct\nperception of PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) and anatta” - Soh, 2019\n“You have underestimated Soh.\nHow can one that on post anatta not know the \"seeming first hand experience that is beyond words\"? For\nexperience is already effortlessly non-dual and \"luminous\".\nThat is precisely his emphasis,\n\"Therefore it is not verbal words we are negating but the very inherency of the aggregates even in direct\nperception of PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) and anatta\"\nHe is referring even this seemingly luminous, non-conceptual, and free experience is tainted. Still carry\n\"mark\" to be negated, a very subtle one. Therefore Tsongkhapa taught, first identify the \"characteristic\nmark\" to be negated.\nIntuiting a basis free from subjectivity and objectivity, \"internality\" and \"externality\" is also a tainted\ncharacteristic (in my opinion).\nEven seeing \"blue\" as dependent origination that arises with causes and a host of conditions still carry a\nmark. It is easy to see \"brown\", \"red\", \"forms\", \"floor\", \"taste\" as dependent origination, it is difficult to see\nthat they are dependent designations.\nSoh may sound as if everything is merely labels and designations, but he is just practicing hard to integrate\nthis aspect into his realization. Nevertheless repeatedly saying \"merely designated\" may not be good when\ndeveloped into a habit. Just my two cents.” - John Tan, 2019\n“William Lim:\nSo, there are different mindstreams, and different non-dual self-knowing appearances \"appears\" to the\ndifferent mindstreams yah? For Weiyu, it's the stars in Australia. For William, it's the laksa in Singapore.\n3d\nLike\nReply\nActive\nSoh Wei Yu\nWilliam Lim\nYes. Mindstreams are also conventional without inherent existence. It is merely a name for a causal rosary\nof discrete moments, just like the word “mala” is just a name imputed on 108 beads strung together, or the\n870\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nword “army” is a name for a collection of soldiers, or the word “weather” is a name for a plethora of various\neverchanging phenomena, etc, but no real entity or core or essence can be found whatsoever when sought.\nUltimately individual minds are also mere imputations that cannot be found. But since it is functional, we\nsay it is conventionally valid to name different minds/mindstreams as such, just as it is conventionally valid\nto call you “William” and I am “Soh”. But no self/Self can ultimately be found.\n3d\nLike\nReply\nEdited\nActive\nSoh Wei Yu:\nAnswering someone on whether it is the “same mindstream” that is reborn, Kyle Dixon explained,\n“It is neither the same nor different, like a series of candle flames that light one another sequentially.\nFrom the Pratītyasamutpādakarikavhyakhyana:\nTherein, the aggregates are the aggregates of matter, sensation, ideation, formations and consciousness.\nThose, called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not\neven the subtle atom of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next.”\n3d\nLike\nReply\nActive\nWilliam Lim:\nThere is no self or inherent existence in a mala or an army, but there is still a kind of \"difference\" between\none mala and another, or one army from another ya? For the appearances (and function) of Soh is\n\"different\" from the appearances of William\nThe designation aren't randomly and arbitrarily assigned ya? For we do not assign the body of Soh together\nwith the chair he sits on as a unified designation. There must be \"something\" that makes one conventionally\nimpute to a \"Soh\" or a 'William\"... namely some form of congregation of appearances. \"Something\"\ndifferentiate one non-inherently existent cloud from another non-inherently existent cloud?\n3d\nLike\nReply\nEdited\nActive\nSoh Wei Yu:\nDesignations depend on the basis of designation which are parts and conditions. These parts and\nconditions are also name only, and empty. So names all the way down.\nAlthough it is not wrong to say our “appearances” are different, we should be careful not to reify\nappearances as an ultimate ground of conventions, which will make appearances the foundational or\n871\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nfundamental reality. Appearances also become falsely reified as a real ground when concepts are reified.\nPresence/appearance is ultimately groundless and illusory.\nJohn Tan said something nice before,\n“Not only that. Like anatta, where an agent is not needed to initiate actions, a hearer not needed to initate\nhearing of sounds; Tsongkhapa wants us to see:\nDesignation too does not require pure appearances or real aggregates as basis, then what designations r\ndesignated upon? It is designations upon designations and designations functions.\nIn other words, to Tsongkhapa, the inability to understand how nominal reality (existing as name only) can\nfunction is what makes us fall into the need of landing onto a real basis.\nThis does not mean that Tsongkhapa did not experience of taste radiance as appearances in anatta insight\nfree from a background self without name constructs, but he has additional insight of about how\n\"designations\" works without relying on basis.”\n3d\nLike\nReply\nActive\nSoh Wei Yu:\nbut you are right that designations are not random or arbitrarily assigned.\nAcarya Malcolm:\n\"“Conventional” simply means “functional,” it does not mean arbitrary or subjective. For example, perceiving\nwater as amṛta, pus, boiling metal, etc., is invalid in the human realm.\nOne can build many kinds of cars, but if they don’t function as cars, they are not cars, conventionally\nspeaking.\"\n\"No, conventions are not subjective, they are conventions because one or more people have agreed to call\na functional thing a given name. For example, a truck is called a lorry in England, but they both refer to a\nheavy vehicle that carries loads.\"\n\"Conventional truths are derived from observing functional appearances. Falsehoods are derived from\nobserving nonfunctional appearances. Example, lake vs. mirage.\"\n\"No, it is not more correct to say consciousness arises or ceases than a labelled self, a since consciousness\nis also a conventional label, like the label \"self.\" Prior to analysis there is both a self, akuppa, and a\nconsciousness. After analysis one will find neither self nor consciousness, beyond the designations\n\"akuppa\" and \"consciousness.\" For example, take a car as a metaphor for \"self\". A car cannot be found in\nany part, all of its parts, or separate from its parts. Likewise, as self cannot be found in any aggregates, all\nof the aggregates, or apart from the aggregates. Likewise, consciousness cannot be found in the sense\norgan nor the sense object, both, or separate from them. The mind is also made of parts, and cannot be\nfound in one of them, all of them, or separate from them.\nFunctionally speaking, we can say there is a self, because when I say \"akuppa go there!\" You will respond\nto this directive by saying yes or no. This means that \"self\" is functional. It is efficient. Whatever is functional\ncorresponds with relative truth. If I said to you, \"Malcolm go there!\" you would respond, \"I am not Malcolm.\"\n872\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSo calling you \"malcolm\" is not functional and therefore cannot be considered to be relatively true.\nConsciousness is a relative truth, as long as it performs its functions, then we can say \"there is a\nconsciousness.\" But when we analyze consciousness, we cannot find it outside of the conventions we use\nfor an appearance we label \"mind.\"\"\nContinue reading at https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/03/some-quotes-by-acarya-malcolm-\nsmith.html\nAcarya Malcolm Smith on Conventional vs Ultimate Truth\n“ – Excerpt from https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/10/are-stars-outside-your-body-or-inside.html\n“Here's a way to see that brown ( the apparence, not the label or designation ) is dependent . Firstly, I find\nit easier to talk in terms of adverbial modifiers instead of subject-object. I.e we don't see brown, we see\nbrownly. Or we see don't see brown table, but we're experiencing in a brownly-tably manner. Now, in order\nfor us to say that we experiece brownly-tably; that is, that we experience in some particular manner\n(brownly-tably), as oppose to merely experiencing as such, we have to subtly appeal to some contrasting\nnotion that is not present (i.e some reference to not-brownly (such as another color) or something that is\nnot a table, etc ). In other words, If all you could ever experience was brownly-tably then you wouldn't have\nwords that signify that as opposed to something else, just as if you're a fish and only ever experience water\nyou wouldn't have a word for \"water\" - it's only when water is contrasted with something else (air) that\nthere's a point to conceptualize water; that there's a need to distinguish it from something else. So how\ncome you say that you see brownly-tably, and not that there's just \"seeing as such\"? How come there's\nseeing in some particular manner? It's because of this: You say you experience brownly-tably because you\nbelieve that experiencing can come in different forms; that can be designated with different adverbial\nmodifiers. And there's your appeal to not-brownly, not-tably ) I.e brownly-tably depends on notions that\nreferences appearances that are not present. Absent these notions, brownly-tably is not brownly-tably at\nall, it's just non-dual luminosity. Now, non-dual luminosity can of course be deconstructed further just as\nbrownly-tably can…” - Göran Backlund\n“[21/7/19, 7:32:29 PM] Soh Wei Yu: The very emptiness of the “thing” immediately implies its unfindability\nand unlocatability. If I look at the patch of grass, the sense that “the greenness of green grass is there” is\nthe very sense of thingness, of locatability. The very seeing that greenness is completely imputed and\nunfindable anywhere in the basis is seeing the emptiness of greenness. Appearances therefore is seen to\nbe empty of any itness anywhere at all, all phenomena are merely conceived. For nowhere in the various\nshades of green can I pinpoint that “this is where the green is” nor can it be found apart, but is merely\nimputed. The undesignated display is by nature empty of true existences as all existence of phenomena\nare merely conventionally imputed, not existing by its own side in the basis of designation. As such they\nare no different from a mere luminous shimmering mirage or reflection with nothing findable whatsoever.\nAll phenomena are like mere chariots”\nMañjuśrī: “What is the root of the imagination which constructs something that is not actually there?”\n873\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nVimalakīrti: “A perverted perception.” Mañjuśrī: “And what is the root of the perverted perception?”\nVimalakīrti: “The fact that it has no support.” Mañjuśrī: “And. what is the root of that?” Vimalakīrti: “This fact,\nthat it has no support, it has no root at all.

Nothing 'goes' or comes out from the surface of the pond when the\nconditions change, e.g. cloud covers. Further we all know that a reflection is merely illusory, not inherently\nexisting somewhere nor can it be found. That reflection, being merely appearing yet not existent, cannot\nbe said to be produced or born - for what merely reflects as an illusion in dependence on a host of\nconditions and disappears without them, how can it be said that something is truly produced or born\nanywhere at all? Yet we cannot say the appearance arose without a cause -- clearly without a clear surface\nof a pond in a cloudless night and clear moon in the sky, the reflections could not have occurred. All\nphenomena when investigated are like that -- appearing and yet not existent, merely in dependence.\nFurthermore, if we say that the drum, the stick, the person hitting the stick on the drum, the vibrations of\nthe air, the ears, so on and so forth are the causes of hearing, or we say that sound originated from\nsomewhere, then exactly which elements of these does the sound originate from? Each of these elements\nare not a self sufficient cause, but collectively then the sound manifest, does it mean there is a producer\nsomewhere responsible for producing it? We find that it is a completely agent-less process of dependent\norigination.\nDogs see black and white flower, humans see red roses, other animals may see other colors never seen\nby humans or something else entirely, does the redness of rose originate from the rose or from the\nhuman mind? If it arise from human mind then a rose would not have been necessary, you can just close\nyour eyes and you should see red flowers, or you should continue to see and smell the red flower when\nsomeone removes it from your sight. We know that is not true. But if it arise from the rose itself or is\ninherently produced by the rose or the redness exists inherently in the rose as its characteristic, then why\ndoes a dog and other animal not see the same thing? So on and so forth. In the end, we can only talk\nabout conditionality and dependencies, but not inherent causation, origins, agents, producers, and\ninherent production.\n877\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nFrom this we know that \"coming from\", \"going to\", does not apply.

Model be is internally triadic, holds that percepts are the actually the activation of traces that\nprovide the content of the world that we perceive as external.\nMadhyamaka is happy with either model. Both are relative, not ultimate.”\n[4:12 PM, 5/26/2019] Soh Wei Yu: “Lonchenpa and Dzogchen in general does not reject external objects.”\n.....\nI believe Malcolm is more into Model B's conventionally although in the end they are all realised to be\nempty.\nRegardless of which model you pick, after MMK analysis, there cannot be an objective universe. Although\none does not necessarily subsume into some subjectivity. Both are empty.\nAs JT said before, \"Also there cannot be objective world in emptiness...\"\n[9:47 PM, 6/3/2020] John Tan: Conventionally speaking means when you are using language and socially\naccepted and agreed norms\n[9:49 PM, 6/3/2020] John Tan: Then you can go all way down to talk about what is valid and invalid\ncognition but it gets combersome which is too dry for me.\n[9:54 PM, 6/3/2020] John Tan: Stian has an article where he said he made a mistake that he assumes an\nexternal world that can be independent of mind but in actuality, he can't because he is always using mind\nand within the environment and always a base factor...so he said mind and phenomena have the same\nnature. Forgotten the details...do you have that article?\n.....\n[12:37 AM, 1/28/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I think the trigger point is realising the emptiness and non arising of\npresence, not merely label or construct\n[7:42 AM, 1/28/2020] John Tan: Now how can \"anything\" non-arise?\n878\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[11:16 AM, 1/29/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Means appear but nothing there or originated.. only a radiant\nappearance like reflection. Doesnt amount to anything\n[9:46 AM, 1/31/2020] John Tan: This there nothing there, originated, only a radiant appearance?\n[9:47 AM, 1/31/2020] John Tan: you must understanding that without realizing that phenomena and\nmind/clarity are of the same nature, it can't be understood this way.\n[9:52 AM, 1/31/2020] John Tan: So one must realize the fundamental issue because phenomena seem so\nsolid, real and objective. The Awareness teaching on the other hand errs towards the other extreme of\nsubsuming which has the same root of ignorance as assuming a true and objective world out there.\n.....\n[9:20 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: In equipoise, there is neither mind nor object. Post equipoise conceptual\nlevel, there is always diversities and duality, there DO, empty and non-arisen.\n[9:20 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[9:21 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: So you see the role of total exertion?\n[9:23 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic.. so total exertion is when there are conventions in post equipoise\n[9:23 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: then anatta nonconceptual is like equipoise?\n[9:24 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: It is like a blending taste...\n[9:33 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: Exactly Matt James is not wrong...lol\n[9:33 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: what do you mean\n[9:35 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: I think Malcolm should be more open...lol\n[9:36 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: My view and understanding is not different from Malcolm.\n[9:40 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: I mean integrate quantum view instead of seeing mountain as there in\ndualism.\n[9:41 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: Quantum view too is conventional. why must you see mountain to be\nthere at all rather than probabilistic waves?\n[9:44 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: Since he accepts appearances are mind but not appearing objects as\nmind. Appearing objects is just conventional, so why not adopt quantum theory explanation?\n[9:48 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: ic..\n[10:14 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: Btw Malcolm is accepting two truth theory from what he said\n[10:19 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. but he says conventional truth is deluded. So in the end is one\ntruth.. and he quotes nagarjuna or something on that\n[10:19 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: So in equipoise there is only ultimate truth i think\n[10:32 AM, 7/25/2020] John Tan: The only truth is to see the emptiness of the conventional. Equipoise\nstrictly speaking is free from all elaborations. That is exactly the experiential insight and taste of anatta, in\nthe seen just the seen, therefore no seer, no seeing, nothing seen.\n[10:39 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[10:43 AM, 7/25/2020] Soh Wei Yu: like kalaka sutta\n…\n[12:56 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Yes that is what I told u\n[12:56 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Snag ba\n[12:56 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Appearances\n[12:57 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: But external object do not exist\n879\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[12:57 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: This must also be understood\n[12:58 AM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[12:59 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: When you deconstruct, you deconstruct object the phenomena\n[12:59 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Object that possess characteristics\n[1:00 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: The deconstruction does not deny it\n[1:00 AM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: ic..\n[1:01 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Otherwise that is subsuming into mind only\n[1:01 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: That is why I said Malcolm does not have to deny quantum theory\n[1:03 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: you don't have to be attached to apparent object as this is merely\nconventional, it can be understood as probability wave\n[1:03 AM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[1:03 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Appearance are mind is a direct taste and experience post anatta.\n[1:04 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: But are there objects?\n[1:05 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Objects are construction like body is a construct...u get what I mean?\n[1:10 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Did I tell you there is no denial of you, others, things...only the I and the\naggregates...\n[1:11 AM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[1:12 AM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: yeah so its not denying external objects but the inherentness of it..\ndoesn't exist in a self-sufficient manner or independent of conditions or in terms of four extremes\n[1:13 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Objectivity creates the impression that there is an independent something\nout there having characteristics\n[1:16 AM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[1:18 AM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: But this is not true at all, objective reality is a concept that arises,\ndependently with subjective experience...\n.....\n[2:35 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: In terms of deconstructing objects, i see in terms of dependent origination\nbut not in terms of subsuming to subjectivity\n[2:35 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: In a sense i agree with malcolm.\n[2:35 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I dont reject objects conventionally\n[2:36 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I dont say antarctica doesnt exist at the moment nobody is observing it.\nClearly the melting ice in antarctica due to global warming is affecting the whole world even if nobody is\nthere observing it at the moment\nYet when we look into the nature of phenomena, of appearance, all are seen as empty dependent arising,\nempty appearance\n[2:36 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Cannot say exist, or do not exist\n[2:37 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I dont resonate with idealist doctrines or yogacara for this reason\n[2:37 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: But at the same time i do not resonate with the inherent existence\nmaterialist paradigm of actual freedom\n[2:43 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: If we see that things exist somewhere like in antarctica that means one\ndoesnt see the emptiness and dependent origination of conventional phenomena and appearance\n880\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[2:44 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: If we say redness of flower exist in mind, then why would there need to\nbe the eyes, the hand holding up the flower, the flower, the space in between?\n[2:45 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: If we say redness exist in flower, then dogs would see redness too\n[2:46 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I dont like the idea redness is in the mind because its just “dreamt up”\n[2:46 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Like what some yogacara like doctrines sounded sometimes\n[2:46 PM, 10/3/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Lol\n[2:56 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: This I have written to you many times\n[2:56 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: Read back what I told\n[2:56 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: Many years back\n[2:57 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: Not you dont exist or Wei yu doesn't exist\n[2:58 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: It is when constructs are deconstructed, what how understand the flux of\nvivid appearances.\n[3:02 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: But how Malcolm express imo also incorrect.\n[3:03 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: It should be it does not exist the way we think instead of it exists.\n[3:29 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: I do not entertain myth stories and live in wonderland as I am a pragmatic\nperson. Practice to me is not about philosophy, it is experientially authenticated in real-time, moment to\nmoment. De-construction of self and phenomena, lead to non-dual experience is a quite a systematic and\nscientific approach and how it liberates the mind.\nAlthough I am not a materialist, I do not reject science esp quantum mechanics but I leave it to solve their\nmysteries.\nWhat I am interested is to see through how conventionalites and reifications confuse, blind and hypnotize\nthe mind and the way of freeing me from that.\nI do not engage in idle talks and speculations that are not helpful to practice.\n[3:38 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: Buddha taught the six sense base, 6 sense organs and 6 consciousness. But\nwe know that eyes do not see, ears do not hear...these are common and conventional world way of\ncommunication.\n[3:40 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: The deconstruction of seeing through essence need not follow strictly. We\ncan deconstruct with modern scientific knowledge, air, wave, eye drums...etc\n[3:41 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: So to me it is just silly and naive to follow blindly and brainlessly otherwise\nwe are no different from those that believe flat earth theory.\n[3:42 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan:\n[3:45 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: I mean I do not reject quantum mechanics. I am also a great believer of\naliens and UFO...\n[3:54 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: The laws that govern the very massive objects and the law that govern the\nman size world and the laws that govern quantum world are different.\n[3:55 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: We think that the speed we travel is everything because we never really\ntravel close to speed of light.\n881\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[3:59 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: Similarly we cannot use experience of man size world to understand the\nworld of the very small, the quantum world...they don't behave the same. We don't just reject thousands\nand thousands of repeated experiments by credible and responsible scientists saying \"I don't believe\".\n[4:02 PM, 10/3/2020] John Tan: And yet we use daily products and technologies created by applications of\nthese scientific laws. Best part is we didn't even know a fraction of what it [is].\n…\n[8:47 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: you are talking about clarity and appearances, but Malcolm and\nlongchenpa and tsongkhapa are not talking about that. They are talking about appearing objects.\n[8:47 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I think malcolm said something like appearance may be mind but\nappearance and objects of appearance of conventionally distinct?\n[8:47 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Are\n[8:48 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Not sure his understanding though\n[8:49 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: So therefore I always asked what are appearances to them and in order to\nsort out what these traditions mean, you cannot assume. you need to know the Tibetan language.\n[8:49 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: Like snag ba\n[8:50 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: My impression is that yogacara is idealist because they totally negate\nexternal world even conventionally and posit that all phenomena are purely projections of consciousness\nlike it is literally a dream\n[8:51 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: For me I have my own way of sorting out my view, experience and insights\nfrom Buddhist contexts. Where it starts and stops. I am not a follower of faith.\n[8:51 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Whereas certain forms of madhyamika, longchenpa and tsongkhapa\ndont necessarily buy thus\n[8:52 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: Prasangika do not care about mind at all\n[8:52 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: Same for me post anatta...\n[8:52 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Yeah in fact post anatta i resonate more with AF than yogacara\n[8:52 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: It is not that mind is not important in practice..\n[8:53 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Except i see in terms of dependent origination and emptiness now\n[therefore in another sense, after twofold emptiness, I do not resonate with AF]\n[8:53 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: In zen though they say there is no mind, they in fact embrace mind more\nfully than all is mind, until no trace of mind can be detected. Yet Shen Yen said this is just the entry point\nof zen because originally there is no mind and this is clearly realized in anatta. So post anatta, mind and\nphenomena are completely indistinguishable.\nIf both mind and phenomena are completely indistinguishable in experience, then distinctions are\nnothing more than conventional designation of empty luminous display.\n[8:54 PM, 7/26/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. btw did sheng yen realise anatta?\n[8:56 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: So you must know when we say no awareness, no self, no I, it doesnt\nmean nothing. It is seeing through the background construct and open the gate to directly taste,\nexperience and effortless authenticate clarity.\n[8:57 PM, 7/26/2020] John Tan: I believe so but he did not talk about his experience except the stanza\nbefore his death that is beautiful.\n882\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nConceptual and Dependent Designation\n“Different types of dependency: several people have given examples, and here's another one.\nA table..\n1. A table depends on legs, a top, screws and braces (parts)\n2. A table depends on being constructed, and trees, and sun and air, and builders (causes and conditions).\n3. A table depends on being conceptualized and designated as a table.\nThis is the subtle one. Let's say you see a leg and a top. Do you see a backrest? No, so you won't call this a\nchair. The designation goes like this - you see some forms, and make them out as legs and a top. You give\nthose forms the name, label, designation of \"table.\"\nThis is subtle because the table is not exactly equal to the parts. The table cannot equal the parts, because\nthen, if the parts change, the parts would be different, and so, following the equation, the table would have\nto change. Another reason the equality cannot hold is that there are many parts and only one table. The\ntable cannot equal the *collection* of parts, because if the parts change, or if a leg gets broken off, or\nswapped out, then the collection changes. So the table would have to be a different table.\nBut we really don't want to say that the table would be different just because the parts are different. We\nwant to somehow say that the table can remain relatively stable as the same table, even if the parts change,\nor get painted, etc.\nAnd at the same time, we cannot find a truly existent, unchanging table behind or within the parts. If we\ndid find such a truly existent table, then we wouldn't need to designate the parts as a table. But we do. It\nmakes no sense that the table would really be a table if no one had ever in history designated anything as\na table.\nSo we allow ourselves to end up saying, in a loose, conventional way, that the table depends on the parts,\nbut is not the parts. It's a table in name only. This kind of naming is the designation-aspect of the\ndependency.\nAnd this loose, conventional approach to tables and selves and life and all things is the experience of\nemptiness. It's a free, flexible, sweetly joyful, open-hearted way of life....” - Greg Goode, 2013\n“And also functionality. A Chariot continues to function even with some of its parts missing. Dependencies\nbased on parts, causes and conditions, relations, functions and imputations.” - John Tan, 2013\n“Why do you believe there’s such a thing as a ‘sentient being’?\n883\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nMāra, is this your theory?\nThis is just a pile of conditions,\nyou won’t find a sentient being here.\nWhen the parts are assembled\nwe use the word ‘chariot’.\nSo too, when the aggregates are present\n‘sentient being’ is the convention we use.\nBut it’s only suffering that comes to be,\nlasts a while, then disappears.\nNaught but suffering comes to be,\nnaught but suffering ceases.” - Vajira Sutta\nJohn tan:\n“To me, realization simply means authenticating the view experientially; in other words, an experiential\ninsight and taste of the view like anatta or emptiness or non-arisen of \"chariot\" in real-time.”\nAlso see: Another Kind of Self-Inquiry: Chandrakirti’s Sevenfold Reasoning on Selflessness\n“For me, the initial insight of anatta was mainly what I have stated in scenario 2 -- seeing through the center\nthat the center has always been assumed, it is extra. In reality it does not exist.\nUp until this point of anatta, I was very much a non-conceptual advocator, less words more experience. I\nhave heard of the word “Kong 空” (Emptiness) numerous times but never exactly know what it truly meant.\nThe idea of Emptiness struck me probably “2 years later when I came across the chariot analogy of the\nBuddhist sage Nāgasena. There was an instant recognition that the analogy is precisely the insight of anatta\nand anatta is the real-time experiential taste of the “Emptiness” in relation to self/Self except that it is now\nreplaced with “chariot” in the example.\nThe insight was huge and I began to re-examine all my experiences from the perspective of \"Emptiness\".\nThis includes mind-body dropped, the impression of hereness and nowness, internal and externality, space\nand time...etc. Essentially a journey of deconstruction, that is, extending the same insight of anatta from\nthe perspective of emptiness to all phenomena, aggregates, mental constructs and even to non-conceptual\nsensory experiences. This led to the taste of instant liberation at spot of not only the background (self) but\nalso the cognized, seen, heard, tasted, smelled and sensed without the need to subsume either subject into\nobject or object into subject but liberates whatever arises at spot.\nThe deconstruction process reveals not only the taste of freedom from freeing the energy that is sustaining\nthe constructs (in fact tremendous energy is needed to maintain the mental constructs) but also a\ncontinuous formation of a perceptual knot that blinds us in a very subtle way and that relates to scenario\n884\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n3 -- Seeing through the fundamental nature of the perceptual knot itself. Seeing the nature of perceptual\nknot involves in seeing clearly certain very persistent and habitual patterns that continues to shape our\nmode of knowing, analysis and experience like a magical spell. The perceptual knot is the habitual tendency\nto reify and Emptiness is the antidote for this reifying tendency.\nThe journey of emptying also convinces me the importance of having the right view of Emptiness even\nthough it is only an intellectual grasped initially. Non-conceptuality has its associated diseases… lol…\ntherefore I always advocate not falling to conceptuality and yet not ignoring conceptuality. That is, strict\nnon-conceptuality is not necessary, only that habitual pattern of reification needs be severed. Perhaps this\nrelates to the zen wild fox koan of not falling into cause and effect and not ignoring cause and effect. A\nkoan that Hakuin remarked as \"difficult to pass through\".\nNot falling, not ignoring.\nA word different, a world of difference.\nAnd the difference causes a wild fox for five hundred lifetimes!\nA long post and time to return to silence.\nNice chat and happy journey David!”\n- John Tan, 2013\n“THE CHARIOT\nAnd King Milinda asked him: \"How is Your Reverence known, and what is your name, sir?\"\n\"As Nagasena I am known, O Great King, and as Nagasena do my fellow religious habitually address me.\nBut although parents give name such as Nagasena, or Surasena, or Virasena, or Sihasena, nevertheless,\nthis word \"Nagasena\" is just a denomination, a designation, a conceptual term, a current appellation, a\nmere name.

How can I be expected to agree with that!\" And to Nagasena he said: \"If, Most\nReverend Nagasena, no person can be apprehended in reality, who then, I ask you, gives you what you\nrequire by way of robes, food, lodging, and medicines? Who is it that guards morality, practises\nmeditation, and realizes the [Four] Paths and their Fruits, and thereafter Nirvana? Who is it that killing\nliving beings, takes what is not given, commits sexual misconduct, tell lies, drinks intoxicants? Who is it\nthat commits the Five Deadly Sins? For, if there were no person, there could ne no merit and no demerit;\nno doer of meritorious or demeritorious deeds, and no agent behind them; no fruit of good and evil\ndeeds, and no reward or punishment for them. If someone should kill you, O Venerable Nagasena, would\nnot be a real teacher, or instructor, or ordained monk! You just told me that your fellow religious\nhabitually address you as \"Nagasena\".

This \"Nagasena\" is just a mere sound, but who is\nthe real Nagasena? Your Reverence has told a lie, has spoken a falsehood! There is really no Nagasena!\"\nThereupon, the Venerable Nagasena said to King Milinda: \"As a king you have been brought up in great\nrefinement and you avoid roughness of any kind. If you would walk at midday on this hot, burning, and\nsandy ground, then your feet would have to trend on the rough and gritty gravel and pebbles, and they\nwould hurt you, your body would get tired, your mind impaired, and your awareness of your body would\nbe associated with pain. How then did you come on foot, or on a mount?\"\n\"I did not come, Sir, on foot, but on a chariot.\"\n\"If you have come on a chariot, then please explain to me what a chariot is.

This \"chariot\" is just a mere sound. But what is the real\nchariot? Your Majesty has told a lie, has spoken a falsehood! There is really no chariot! Your Majesty is the\ngreatest king in the whole of India. Of whom then are you afraid, that you do not speak the truth?\" And he\nexclaimed: \"Now listen, you 500 Greeks and 80,000 monks, this King Milinda tells me that he has come on\na chariot. But when asked to explain to me what a chariot is, he cannot establish its existence. How can\none possibly approve of that?\"\nThe 500 Greeks thereupon applauded the Venerable Nagasena and said to King Milinda: \"Now let You\nMajesty get out of that if you can!\"\nBut King Milinda said to Nagasena: \"I have not, Nagasena, spoken a falsehood. For it is in dependence on\nthe pole, the axle, the wheels, the framework, the flag-staff, etc, there takes place this denomination\n\"chariot\", this designation, this conceptual term, a current appellation and a mere name.\"\n\"Your Majesty has spoken well about the chariot.

Well spoken!\"” - The Questions of King Milinda (As Answered by the Arahant, Nagasena)\nAlso see: Another Kind of Self-Inquiry: Chandrakirti’s Sevenfold Reasoning on Selflessness by Greg Goode\n“With regard to the way in which things are posited through the force of conceptuality, Aryadeva’s Four\nHundred says:\nWithout [imputation by] conceptuality [like the imputation of a snake to a rope], there is no [finding of] the\nexistence of desire and so forth. If so, who with intelligence would maintain that a real object is produced\n[dependent on] conceptuality? [For, being imputed by conceptuality and existing as its own reality are\ncontradictory.]\nChandrakirti’s commentary on this passage says:\nThere is on question that what exists merely due to the existence of conceptuality and does not exist without the\nexistence of conceptuality is, like a snake imputed to a coiled rope, to be ascertained as not established by way of\nits own entity.\nTherefore, conceptuality [here refers to] this ordinary, innate awareness which makes designations of\nforms and so forth through having become accustomed again and again since beginningless time to\nthinking, “This is a form,” “This is a feeling,” and so forth.\n[The example of a rope-snake illustrates] how things are posited through the force of [ordinary innate\nconceptuality]. When darkness has fallen on a rope, it is thought to be a snake since the variegated colors\nof the rope and the way in which it is coiled are like a snake and it is seen in a dim place. At that time,\nneither the color of the rope, its shape, its other parts, nor the collection of those parts may be posited as\nsomething that is a snake. The snake of this occasion is only a mere designation by conceptuality in\ndependence upon the rope.\nSimilarly, when the thought “I” arises in terms of the five [mental and physical] aggregates that are its bases\nof designation, neither the individual aggregates, the collection, their continuum, nor their parts can be\nposited as something that is I. Furthermore, there is not in the least any phenomenon that is a separate\nentity from those [mental and physical aggregates] and can be apprehended as something that is I. The I is\nmerely posited by conceptuality in dependence upon the aggregates.\nAlthough the way in which all phenomena are imputed by conceptuality is, in this way, like the imputing of\na snake to a rope, a rope-snake and phenomena such as forms are not the same with respect to whether\nor not they conventionally exist. For they are dissimilar in terms of whether or not conventional valid\ncognition damages an assertion [made] in accordance with what is being imputed.\n888\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nFurthermore, with respect to how [phenomena] are mere nominal imputations, one engages in adopting\n[virtues] and discarding [non-virtues] in dependence on mere nominalities which are conventions\ndesignated to these phenomena such as forms, “This is a form,” “This is a feeling,” and so forth, and through\nthis, desired aims are accomplished. Also, within the context of mere nominality, all affirmations and\nnegations of correctness and incorrectness, etc., as well as all agents, actions, and objects are possible.\nHowever, if one is not satisfied with mere nominalities and enters into searching to find the object imputed\nin the expression “form”, [trying to discover] whether it can be taken as color, shape, some other factor, or\nthe collection of all these, and so forth, one will not find anything, and all presentations [of phenomena]\nwill become impossible.\nMaking presentations of what is and is not correct in the context of mere nominalities is most feasible. For\nexample, there were two villagers who went to a city to see the sights. They went into a temple and began\nto look at the paintings, whereupon one of them said, “That one holding a trident in his hand is Narayana;\nthe other holding a wheel in his hand is Maheshvara.” The other villager said, “You are mistaken; the one\nholding a trident is Maheshvara, and the one holding a wheel is Narayana.” And thus they disputed.\nA wandering holy man was nearby. They went up to him, and each spoke his thought. The wanderer\nthought, “Being murals on a wall, these are neither Maheshvara nor Narayana.” Although he knew that, still\nhe did not say, “These are not gods, but paintings.” Instead, in conformity with the conventions of the world,\nhe told the two villagers that one of them was right and the other wrong. Through his speaking thus, the\nwishes of the two villagers were fulfilled, and the wanderer also did not incur the fault of telling a lie.\nLikewise, although all phenomena do not have objective establishment, presentations such as, “This is\ncorrect, and that is incorrect,” are feasible within the context of mere nominalities. Although the\nSupramundane Victor [Buddha] sees that all phenomena do not truly exist, even he teaches the adopting\n[of virtues] and discarding [of non-virtues] using terminology as the world does, thereby bringing about the\nwelfare of transmigrators.\nThis way [of presenting nominalities] was taught by Buddhapalita, a great master who had attained yogic\nfeats, in his commentary on the eighteenth chapter of Nagarjuna’s Treatise on the Middle Way. The\nhonorable Chandrakirti and the revered Shantideva also, through many examples and reasonings, explain\nstill other ways in which agent, object, and action are feasible within the context of mere nominalities. I will\nnot elaborate more on the topic here.\nThis presentation of conventions is the uncommon way in which the three masters [Buddhapalita,\nChandrakirti, and Shantideva] comment on the thought of the Superior [Nagarjuna]. The Foremost\nOmniscient Father [Dzong-ka-ba] and his spiritual sons [Gyel-tsap and Kay-drup] frequently advised that\njust this is the final difficult point of the Middle Way School view.\n889\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAbout this way [of presenting conventionalities], the Questions of Upali Sutra says:\nThese alluring blossoming flowers of various colors\nAnd these fascinating brilliant mansions of gold\nAre without any [inherently existent] maker here.\nThey are posited through the power of conceptuality,\nThe world is imputed through the power of conceptuality.\nAnd the King of Meditative Stabilizations Sutra says:\nNirvana is not found\nIn the way nirvana is taught\nBy words to be profound.\nThe words also are not found…\nAnd a Perfection of Wisdom Sutra says:\nIt is this way: this “Bodhisattva” is only a name. It is this way: this “enlightenment” is only a name. It is this\nway: this “perfection of wisdom” is only a name…\nAnd the Superior Nagarjuna’s Precious Garland says that name-only does not exist ultimately:\nBecause the phenomena of forms are\nOnly names, space too is only a name.\nWithout the elements, how could forms\n[inherently] exist?\nTherefore even “name-only” does not [inherently] exist.”\n- Emptiness Yoga: The Tibetan Middle Way, Jang-gya’s Text\n“[It has been said:]\nWhatever was acceptable to someone in the past,\nthat should work for him [to begin the practice].\nA person who is confused\nIs never a [suitable] vessel for the holy teachings.\nMoreover, in the scriptures the Bhagavan said:\nThe world has a dispute with me.\n890\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nI do not have a dispute with the world.\nWhat the world accepts I accept.\nWhat the world does not accept I do not accept.\n[And in the Catuhsataka 8.19, Aryadeva says:]\nJust as a foreigner is not able\nto understand a language other than his own,\nso the world is not able\nto understand anything but the affairs of the world.\nAnd so on. This [view, that everything that is real by convention exists, was taught] by the Bhagavan for\npeople in need of guidance [and] in whom the desire has awakened to hear something about the generally\naccepted way in which things are actually distinguished. The aggregates, the elements, and the bases of\nperception are, in truth, conceptualization. They are obtained by the impaired vision of ignorance. This\nmuch of the truth has been described by the Bhagavan from that perspective for the purpose of giving rise\nto a more significant life for the worldly person.” - Chandrakirti\n\"Don’t misunderstand the term “mere imputation” wrongly. It is very important to understand the term\n“mere” is very special in Prasangika. “Mere” and “cannot stand at its own side” are synonym. In other\nwords, you can treat “mere” to mean “because the emptiness of phenomena is deep and the\ndependencies are profound, it cannot be expressed but called it ‘mere’”. Much like Tao cannot be\nexpressed, very reluctantly, Lao Tze named it Tao. It is completely opposite of our common usage like\n“don’t worry, it is merely a label”.\nThe very fact that phenomenon are empty of inherent existence means that phenomena are not existing\nat their own side therefore this “mere designation” cannot be eliminated in the ordinary sense; in fact\nthere is no elimination, you can’t. To free it, one must see “Emptiness” and Dependent Origination.\nBecause of the profundity, if one practice the inferring and reasoning path, there are various lines of\nreasoning like diamond silver, sevenfold reasoning, unfindable as one or many, four extremes and lastly\nof course, the king of reasoning Dependent Arising to guide the practitioners towards right\nunderstanding.\nThus this “mere imputation” can’t be overcome by deep shamatha concentration; can’t be overcome by\nordinary non-conceptuality; can’t be overcome by non-thinking because it is “dependent” on its basis; it is\nnot just a designation. Even the cessation of Nirodha-samapatti cannot do away with this “mere\nimputation” permanently.\nIn Prasangika, only the intuitive insight of prajna wisdom of both self/Self and Phenomena is able to break\nthe chain of specific dependent origination because ignorance as the root cause of cyclical existence is\nsevered.\n891\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAnyway just my 2 cents. Please read and understand with yor own insights and experiences. See you in\nSingapore!\" ~ John Tan, 2014\n“[9:00 AM, 7/26/2018] John Tan: I see conceptual designation as a process that includes naming and\nlabelling. Naming and labeling is at the end of the process. If we just focus on naming and labeling, we\nend up rendering wordless perception as the destination.\nWhen mind designates, it does not have to name. When we open eyes, the natural tendency to see\ndistinctly a group of features (BOD Basis of designation) into one even before naming is considered\ndesignation (imo).\nTherefore to me, designation includes wordless perception. When form or sound arise, those already are\nforms of mind designation. Otherwise practice would be very surface and not deep down into mind\ntendencies and energy level. Anatta deconstruction is at the level of pre-labelling.\n[9:01 AM, 7/26/2018] John Tan: That is how I understand designations”\n[5:36 PM, 3/29/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Looking at the tree [in a PCE mode of wordless anatta perception]..\nseems like a huge entity but when examined is not one or many, many branches and leaves swaying in\ndifferent directions.. just like chariot and h2o is just an essenceless display of interdependence\n[5:38 PM, 3/29/2020] Soh Wei Yu: The perception of tree is shaped by conditions and views.. in truth\nnothing can be found, unborn\n[5:38 PM, 3/29/2020] Soh Wei Yu: A vividly luminous and empty display\n“Soh: Actually in anatta and emptiness, there is no absolutes, no noumenon. Especially in emptiness,\neverything is conventions. Even the nondual perception of a pure sound, sight, floor, is seen as\ndependently designated, with no essence whatsoever when sought. The complete unfindability of a\nreferent of a convention is precisely the emptiness of that convention, and all conventions are equally\nempty and dependently designated.\n…\nMr. G wrote: ‘Without relying on convention, the ultimate will not be understood.\"\nI disagree.\nThe taste of orange can be conventional when described..... or, not at all.’\nSoh replied: Taste of Orange is already two conventions combined. The moment concept arises to establish\ntaste, orange, know that is designation. Taste of orange does not exist objectively or inherently somewhere\nto be found, when examined no taste of orange can be found despite whatever appearances that serves\nas conditions for the designation, and those appearances too cannot be found. Is taste the characteristic\nof orange or is orange imputed subjectively in dependence on taste, and other factors too? Is taste truly\nexisting and findable or is it too imputed? Just like the red of the rose does not exist objectively in the rose,\nfor it depends on conditions (only humans and certain species can see red) and on designating\n892\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nconsciousness that names 'red' and then attributes 'red' to 'a rose', and the rose too does not exist\ninherently, objectively, by its own side, independent of imputation and the factors [other conventional and\ndesignated phenomena] that contribute to that imputation of rose, including the 'red color' (which too is\nconventional). Prior to designation, there is no taste of orange. Even during the designation, there is no\ntaste of orange for the taste of orange cannot be found to exist anywhere besides a designation that\ndepends on a whole host of other conventional phenomena and designations, it does not exist objectively,\ninherently. The parts of the car does not amount to an inherently existing car existing by its own side, for\nthe car, and even the parts, are designated in dependence on the designating consciousness and a whole\nhost of factors, which too are dependently designated.\nA state without or prior to designation or where thoughts and concepts are suspended is not the end of\nignorance, for there must be the realization that all phenomena are designated in dependence (on parts,\nconditions, function, designating consciousness) and empty of existing by its own side [which is to say,\nempty of inherent existence -- inherent existence means existing by its own side independent of\nimputation], empty of any essence. And this applies even to seemingly pure taste, touch, sights, in PCE\n(Pure Consciousness Experience) mode.”\n“It is also important to know that because of this thorough on going \"becoming\", when expressed in a\nconventional and relative world, it has to be expressed as dependent arising and emptiness.\nIn other words, because the mind designates using static conventions, it has to qualify these conventions\nwith dependencies to present the flux. \"Dependent arising and emptiness\" is simply a more elegant way\nof presenting \"change without changing thing\".\nTaking the growing process of the seed to plant and plant to tree example, if we divide it into a million\nframes and asked at which point has the seed become a plant and at which point it becomes a tree? They\nwill say it \"depends\", whichever frame they choose. The frame they chose is the designation, the \"it\ndepends\" are the dependencies. The designation is only valid within the set of dependencies that defines\nit…\n...By the way, even the fluxing view of dependent origination is put to the challenge in prasangika… and it\nis the key of dependent designation.” - John Tan, 2019\n“Steve, Madhyamika interprets the \"thingness\" gestalt as a type conception, a way of reacting or\nconceptualizing words or concepts or sensations, as if there were existence involved. Maybe some words\nseem to invite this kind of reifying conceptualization more than others - we usually feel that more physical-\nsounding, more concrete words entail a more independent kind of existence. But Madhyamika would\nrefute this kind of existence across the board.\n893\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nDoes \"dependent arising\" require there is (A) something dependent that arises, and (B) something that A is\ndependent on? Even though Madhyamika itself refutes this?\nNot according to Madhyamika itself. When A is said to be dependent, the meaning is that it is not\nINdependent. It is not self-sufficient, it has no essence or true nature.\nWhat does \"dependent\" mean? Dependence is usually broken down into three types. Phenomenon A\nrelies on pieces and parts, on conditions, and on conceptual designation.\nBut none of these things (pieces + parts, conditions, conceptual designation) is an inherent, self-standing\nthing. Each of these things itself dependent.\nThis kind of dependency is not linear, tracing back to an original first cause or universal stopping point. It's\nmore like a web of dependencies. It's not arboreal, it's rhizomatic.” - Greg Goode\nCauses Dependent on Effect (Two-way Dependency)\nTwo-Way Dependency/Dependent Designation\nAlso see: What Buddha Taught about Consciousness\nEmptiness as Unity\n“Here is Ācārya Malcolm’s brief summation of this section of the MMK, and his citation of Buddhapalita’s\ncommentary:\nNāgārjuna's arguments run in three phases: first, self-arising is negated; then, arising from others is\nnegated; and finally causeless negation is negated. Of these three types of arising, the second is what we\nconventionally term \"arising.\"\n[However] Things do not [truly] arise. Why? Because their causes and conditions cannot be established\nwhen investigated. This is why Buddhapalita states [in his commentary on Nāgārjuna’s\nMūlamadhyamakakārikā]:\nHere, with respect to your claim for an ascertained cause for the production of a result, wheat, etc., and a non-\nproductive condition and non-condition, ‘the arising of a result is not accepted’ was previously explained.\nIf that result does not exist, where will ‘these are not conditions, these are conditions’ be accepted? If both of\nthose come to be from depending on a result, also that result is does not exist. Because the result does not exist,\nwhere will there be a non-condition or a condition? If that is so, still results are not accepted, and even\nconditions and a non-conditions are non-existent. Because results, conditions, and non-conditions do not exist,\ndescriptions for arising are merely conventional.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\n894\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nJohn Tan\nNow in hearing, there is only sound. In total exertion, not only the ears heard, the eyes, the hair, the entire\nbody hears...there is no eye, no ear, no body...all six entries are one function and even that act of hearing\nis profoundly deconstructed.\nOr let's say just anatta, in hearing there is only sound. If you search for\n\"sound\", you can never find it. If you try to find the line of demarcation\nthat separates sound and the conditions that give rise to it, can you find that line?\nSoh\nnope\nJohn Tan\nIn non-conceptual mode of anatta, just a dimensionless sphere of clear \"tingsss\" and even saying that is\ntoo much. Is there separation of the bell, the ear, the stick, the air...etc? All is profoundly exerted into the\nsuchness beyond speech. However when you expressed conventionally, must you not see the dependent\narising, the causal dependencies?\nSo you must know at the ultimate it is expressed as if there is no sound, no conditions but at the\nconventional it is expressed as Dependent Origination.\nTherefore if one does not see Dependent Origination, he will not see the ultimate correctly. To teach\nemptiness is to to see Dependent Origination and to see Dependent Origination is to see emptiness.\nAppears therefore empty, empty therefore appears. There is no emptiness without appearance and no\nappearances that is not empty.\nJohn Tan\nJust read Greg's comments. He pointed one important point that is mutual dependency. In Prasangika, this\nmutual dependency is quite unique and important but not in the sense that they affect or produce each\nother but they (cause and effect) are mutually dependent for their conventional existence. For example we\nnormally think sound is causally dependent on its causes and conditions for its arising but in Prasangika,\nsound is dependent on its conditions and the conditions are also dependent on sound for their existence.\nWhy so? This is important to understand total exertion.\nSoh\nits like without sunlight, the sun would not be the sun... sunlight makes sun what it is conventionally.. sound\nactualizes a bell, and blowing wind actualizes a fan\ninteresting.. if we think of computer screen as an entity, then the images on the screen and the screen is\nonly a one way dependency. the images are dependent on the screen and the screen is not dependent on\n895\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nthe images... the screen will always be the screen (until it gets 'destroyed') and the images come and go,\nshows on and off. but seeing the lack of intrinsic existence of screen and image... then it’s like water pouring\ninto water, screen and image co-emerge in total exertion... its not youtube happening on a screen... the\nscreen is manifested through youtube and it is youtube-screen. the same goes for consciousness... that’s\nwhy buddha said consciousness is reckoned by its conditions (reference:\nhttp://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm)...\n(comments by Soh: The same can be said in many other examples: Plane and Flying (we may think of 'flying'\nas something that 'plane' is 'doing', but what does the co-emergence of plane and flying and the lack of\nintrinsic identity of both tells us?), Subject-Action-Object, etc...)\nJohn Tan\nWell said. The heart of total exertion and emptiness...feel it. you are beginning to bring the taste of total\nexertion into \"view\". Even in conventionality and conceptuality, the experience of \"water pouring water\" in\nmeditative equipoise can be brought into actual taste. +A and -A can be integrated.\np.s. This excerpt by Dogen is worth repeating: “Birth is just like riding in a boat. You raise the sails and row\nwith the pole. Although you row, the boat gives you a ride, and without the boat no one could ride. But you\nride in the boat and your riding makes the boat what it is. Investigate such a moment.”\nAlso, अष्टावक्र शान्ति posted nice quotes from Dalai Lama:\n\"Something is not a cause in and of itself; it is named a “cause” in relation to its effect. Here the effect does\nnot occur before its cause, and its cause does not come into being after its effect; it is in thinking of its\nfuture effect that we designate something as a cause. This is dependent-arising in the sense of dependent\ndesignation.\" - H.H Dalai Lama\n\"But when you take it further, the dependent-arising of cause and effect comes because of dependent\ndesignation, which itself indicates that cause and effect do not have their own being; if they did have their\nown being, they would not have to be dependently designated.\" - H.H Dalai Lama\nHHDL's explanation on dependent designation is very clear! Funny how I didn't see it in the past though I\nread through his book before:\nhttps://books.google.com.au/books?id=kqvlPsyV33IC&pg=PA190&lpg=PA190#v=onepage&q&f=false\nDependent Designation is a key teaching of Madhyamika:\n896\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n\"Whatever is dependently co-arisen\nThat is explained to be emptiness.\nThat, being a dependent designation\nIs itself the middle way.\nSomething that is not dependently arisen,\nSuch a thing does not exist.\nTherefore a non-empty thing\nDoes not exist. \"\n-- Nagarjuna\n\"If there is something which exists, it must originate dependently and be designated dependently. Why?\nThere are no phenomena at all that are not dependently originated, therefore, a non-empty phenomena\ndoes not exist.\" - Buddhapalita\n..........\nWrote more: 21/12/2014: Water pouring into water may be understood as mere non-division of subject and\nobject, in fact you hear descriptions of how the realization of Atman-Brahman is like pouring a drop of\nwater into the great ocean, and so on.\nHowever, the water pouring into water in Madhyamika has a more subtle meaning. The subject and object,\nrealization and object of realization, etc etc is released like water pouring into water. This means seeing the\nselflessness, the emptiness of self and object, screen and images, plane and flying, car/driver/driving, etc\netc leads to the taste of empty and non-dual seamless exertion.\nFor example now you no longer see yourself as an independent driver existing independent of the driving\n(driver is dependently designated in dependence of driving and car), driving a car which is mistakenly seen\nto exist independent of the driver and driving. Neither are you saying the driver collapses into the car or\nthe car collapses into the driver. Rather, by seeing how driver, car and driving are dependent and empty,\nthen car, driver, driving, environment 'melts' into empty, non-dual seamless exertion. Your riding makes\nthe boat what it is.\nIn this case, subject and object are non-dual like Advaita but not really the same in view, because you are\nnot collapsing one pole to another but releasing them into non-obstruction.\n=============\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/adrqp1/what_does_nagarjuna_mean_when_he_says_cau\nses/\n897\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWhat does Nagarjuna mean when he says causes depends on effects?\nQuestion\nHe seems to mean this in more than just referential way as in “East land” cannot exist without “Westland”\nwhere the notions of Eastland and Westland cannot exist without each area but the area can. So Eastland\nphysically can exist without Westland but it’s referential name cannot.\nBut Nagarjuna seems to suggest the cause itself cannot exist without the effect.

First there must be a deep conviction that arising does not need an essence. That view of subjective\nessence is simply a convenient view.\n2. First emptying of self/Self does not necessarily lead to illusion-like experience of reality. It does however\nallows experience to become vivid, luminous, direct and non-dual.\n3. First emptying may also lead a practitioner to be attached to an 'objective' world or turns physical. The\n'dualistic' tendency will resurface after a period of few months so it is advisable to monitor one's progress\nfor a few months.\n4. Second emptying of phenomena will turn experience illusion-like but take note of how emptying of\nphenomena is simply extending the same \"emptiness view\" of Self/self.\n5. From these experiences and realizations, contemplate what is meant by \"thing\", what is meant by mere\nconstruct and imputation.\n899\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n6. \"Mind and body drop\" are simply dissolving of mind and body constructs. If one day the experience of\nanatta turns a practitioner to the attachment of an 'objective and actual' world, deconstruct \"physical\".\n7. There is a relationship between \"mental constructs\", energy, luminosity and weight. A practitioner will\nexperience a release of energies, freedom, clarity and feel light and weightless deconstructing 'mental\nconstructs'.\n8. Also understand how the maha experience of interpenetration and non-obstruction is related to\ndeconstructions of inherent view.\n9. No body, no mind, no dependent origination, no nothing, no something, no birth, no death. Profoundly\ndeconstructed and emptied! Just vivid shimmering appearances as Primordial Suchness in one whole\nseamless unobstructed-interpenetration.\"\n---------\nOn another occasion, Thusness wrote (not to Taiyaki):\n“...Like after anatta, as I have said many times the sense of externality and physicality can still be very strong.\nMy deconstruction process of \"externality\" and \"physicality\" is actually based few questions: 1. Why is mind\nwhich is \"mental\" is able to \"interact\" with something \"physical\"? 2. Why does consciousness need\nconditions for its arising? 3. What is interaction? All these questions help stabilized my experiences when I\npenetrated them in my own way.\nIllusion like realization (arose) when I contemplated \"hereness\" and \"nowness\" until my mind was able to\nintuit the logic behind all these, then experience becomes stable. However one can enter by experience to\nhave a taste of it…”\nThere is a very good video by Alan Watts that I highly recommend to watch in its entirety as it addresses\nthe issue of whether there is objective reality and the interrelationship between an organism and its\nenvironment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dg7VlvvM88&feature=youtu.be\nDependent Origination\n“This dependent arising is the dharmakāya of all the tathāgatas. A person who sees dependent arising\nsees the Tathāgata.”\n— Āryapratītyasamutpādanāmamahāyānasūtra\nDogen, Shōbōgenzō:\n900\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n\"Tathagatas [Buddhas] never go beyond clarifying cause and effect\"\n“Unless one understands dependent origination as the Buddha taught it, one will not realize emptiness.” –\nDzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith, 2018\n“What is meant by dependent origination? It means that nothing included within inner or outer\nphenomena has arisen without a cause. Neither have they originated from what are not their causes; that\nis, noncauses such as a permanent creator [in the form of] the self, time, or the Almighty. The fact that\nphenomena arise based on the interdependence of their respective causes and conditions coming\ntogether is called dependent origination. To proclaim this is the unique approach of the Buddha’s\nteaching.\nIn this way, the arising of all outer and inner phenomena require that their respective causes and\nconditions come together in the appropriate manner. When these factors are incomplete, phenomena do\nnot arise, while when complete, they will definitely arise. That is the nature of dependent origination.\nThus, dependent origination ranks as an essential and profound teaching among the treasuries of the\nBuddha’s words. The one who perceives dependent origination with the eyes of discriminating knowledge\nwill come to see the qualities that have the nature of the eightfold noble path, and with the wisdom gaze\nthat comprehends all objects of knowledge will perceive the dharmakaya of buddhahood. Thus it has\nbeen taught.\nJamgon Mipham Rinpoche”\n“There are two [aspects of dependent origination], general (non-afflictive) and specific (afflictive) D.O.\n[dependent origination]. Both are enlightened views. Means the mind suddenly stops seeing self and he\nmust drop self/Essence view.” - John Tan, 2015\n“When the mind divides and see separation, D.O. and emptiness is the excellent tool to de-construct\nessence and triggers the insight of anatta and emptiness. So it is the enlightened view.” – John Tan, 2020\nJohn Tan wrote in 2014, \"Be it Buddha himself, Nagarjuna or Tsongkhapa, none [of them] never got\noverwhelmed and amazed with the profundity of dependent origination. It is just that we do not have the\nwisdom to penetrate enough depth of it.\" and \"Actually if you do not see Dependent Origination, you do\nnot see Buddhism [i.e. the essence of Buddhadharma]. Anatta is just the beginning.\"\n“\"The view of production and destruction must be clear. What is the right view of such an experience?\nThe ‘tree’ as total exertion cannot be said to arise or not arise. As Nāgārjuna aptly states, whatever\narises in dependence is empty and thus non-arisen. Those who think in terms of true arising, abiding, and\ncessation hold a perverted view (颠倒) and have not realized the true meaning of ‘dependence.’ If you do\nnot see dependent origination (DO), you do not see emptiness—there is no emptiness without DO.\n901\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nPeople who preach only about emptiness are often teaching awareness in disguise, no matter how\nelegantly it’s presented. There may be a direct touch of awareness or presence, yet without insight into\nthe ‘nature’ of presence itself (明心但未见性). Both aspects—awareness and emptiness—are equally\nimportant.\nAfter realizing anatta, if one's understanding leans toward total exertion, like the ‘tree’ and ‘cosmos,’ it is\nessential to revisit and examine 'Awareness' or 'Presence.' In doing so, the ground of being itself will be\nshaken and not stand too, then experience is both groundless yet cosmic. Exertion becomes spontaneous\nand natural.”” – John Tan\n\"Buddhism is not about attaching to a special immutable essence that is unborn and eternal but the arising\nof prajna wisdom that brings about the cessation of flawed perception of \"birth\" and \"death\", existence and\nnon-existence. This is the process of specific (afflictive) Dependent Origination that starts from ignorance.\nTherefore I told you dependent origination is the enlightened view. For the unenlightened do not\nunderstand or see it this way.\" - John Tan, 2015\n“The Buddhas know that all phenomena arise interdependently.\nThey know all world systems exhaustively.\nThey know that all phenomena in all worlds are interrelated as in Indra's net.\" - Avatamsaka Sutra\n\"Seeing afflictive Dependent Origination is enlightened view because one sees Dependent Origination.\nThere is no [insight into] afflictive Dependent Origination for sentient beings, there is [the conceiving of a]\nSelf/self... they do not see Dependent Origination.\" - John Tan, 2014\n“John Tan: Because there is mind, if there is no mind, what happened?\nSoh: Just activities, thoughts, scenery, sounds.\nJohn Tan: What is the sense of self in anatta?\nSoh: The activity of grasping.\nJohn Tan: Very good and well said.\nThe anatta insight not only sees through background but directly perceives dependent origination, both\nafflictive and non-afflictive. Self is that afflictive dependent origination that arises from ignorance. It is that\nformation. The general dependent origination becomes the effortless spontaneous presence when\nignorance is not in action. Both are directly experienced in real-time. So with anatta insight, no-self is\n902\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nauthenticated. Afflictive D.O. chain is authenticated, general D.O. is authenticated, the purpose of vipassana\nis authenticated from moment to moment in real-time. What doubt is there?” - John Tan, 2019\nNow, here the Buddha says that the fruit of stream entry is:\n“Monks, there are these six rewards in realizing the fruit of stream-entry. Which six? One is certain of the\ntrue Dhamma. One is not subject to falling back. There is no suffering over what has had a limit placed on\nit. [1] One is endowed with uncommon knowledge. [2] One rightly sees cause, along with causally-\noriginated phenomena.\n\"These are the six rewards in realizing the fruit of stream-entry.\"\n• AN 6.97\nThe Buddha also taught,\n\"When a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co-arising & these\ndependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present, it is not possible that he would run after\nthe past, thinking, 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past?\nHaving been what, what was I in the past?' or that he would run after the future, thinking, 'Shall I be in the\nfuture? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been\nwhat, what shall I be in the future?' or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present,\nthinking, 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' Such\na thing is not possible. Why is that? Because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right\ndiscernment this dependent co-arising & these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually\npresent.\"\n— SN 12.20\n“Conditioned reality” as in the twelve links in operation is samsara itself, but realizing it is dependently\noriginating is not a samsaric view because sentient beings do not realize dependent origination, it is the\ndeep wisdom of Buddha that he realised dependent origination on the night of his awakening, such that\nhe said,\n“Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance. It’s because of not understanding and not\npenetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted\nrushes and reeds, and does not go beyond transmigration, beyond the planes of deprivation, woe, & bad\ndestinations.” - https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN15.html” - Soh, 2019\n[26/12/15, 10:29:01 AM] John Tan: A sudden non-dual realisation of the relationship between mind and\nphenomena.

By re-formulating the question, the Buddha wanted to point out that there is no reason for\n905\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nassuming that the nutriment consciousness \"feeds\" or conditions any separate person hovering behind it;\nbut that consciousness constitutes just one link in a chain of processes indicated by the Buddha in the\nfollowing.\n4.\nThe nutriment consciousness signifies here the rebirth-consciousness.\n5.\naayatim punabbhavaabhinibbatti; Comy: \"This is the mind-and-body (naama-ruupa) conascent with that very\n(rebirth) consciousness.\" This refers to the third link of the dependent origination: \"Through (rebirth)\nconsciousness conditioned is mind-and-body\" (viññaa.na-paccayaa naama-ruupam).\n6.\nComy: \"The Exalted One said this for giving to the monk an opening for a further question.\"\n7.\nComy: \"Why does not the monk continue to ask: 'Who becomes?'

And also the Master terminates here the exposition, thinking: 'However\nmuch he questions, he will not be satisfied. He is just asking empty questions.'\"\n8.\nComy: \"Here the Master takes up that very point from where he started the exposition: 'Through the sixfold\nsense (organ) base conditioned is sense-impression,' and here he now turns round the exposition (to the\ncessation of the cycle of dependent origination).\n\"In this discourse, there is one link (of cause and fruit) between consciousness and mind-and-body; one link\n(of fruit and cause) between feeling and craving, and one link (of cause and fruit) between the process of\nbecoming and birth.\"\nSub-Comy: \"Since, in the words of the discourse, 'The nutriment consciousness is a condition for the future\narising of a renewed existence,' (consciousness is regarded) as being a condition in a former existence for\na future existence, and as being a principal cause (muula-kaarana), therefore the Commentary says that\n'there is a link (of cause and fruit) between consciousness and mind-and-body.'

Total exertion of DO is not to make us more\ndumb...lol. From top to bottom, there is no self, just these activities.”\nGeneral Principle of Dependent Origination\nWhen there is this, that is.\nWith the arising of this, that arises.\nWhen this is not, neither is that.\nWith the cessation of this, that ceases.\n~ Buddha (Samyutta Nikaya, II:28, 65, as translated by P. A. Payutto, 1994)\nThe Buddha applied the principle of dependent origination not only to the afflictive twelve links, but also in\nother examples such as the transcendent dependent arising that ends suffering. The principle of\ndependent arising also applies to the arising of the six types of consciousness. This must be seen as so\neven in the unafflicted state of anatta ‘in the seen just the seen, in the heard just the heard’. Otherwise the\nseen and heard becomes reified as inherently self-existing, independent from conditions.\n“This arising thought and previous thought, are they the same or different? This arising thought and\nprevious thought, are they dependent or completely independent? Beyond the extremes, see the middle\npath of dependent origination.” - John Tan, 2012\nFurthermore, in practice, contemplation of the general principle of dependent arising in any given mundane\nactivity is important for the experiential insight into Maha Total Exertion (see below). Although the afflictive\nchain of dependent origination is the predominant experience of someone prior to realization of anatta,\nthe general principle of dependent origination is even more relevant for post-anatta experience especially\nwhen anatta is thoroughly stabilized and self/Self dissolved, as all experiences are pure, clean, luminous,\ncenterless, agentless, traceless. Yet, the pure experience of anatta is seen as the functioning of seamless\ninterdependencies which leads to the taste of Maha Total Exertion. Furthermore, the foreground\npresencing/aggregates must be realized to be empty and non-arising through dependent origination and\ndependent designation.\n“John Tan: Do you feel being caused or effected? It is just a single flow. Now when we see one, the 10000\nthings arise\nSoh Wei Yu: Yes single flow..\nJohn Tan: This is the right way of seeing… not ignorance. This is the general principle of DO” - Conversation\nwith John Tan, 2013\n“In order to understand phase 7 you need to understand phase 6. For those that have not dissolved the\nbackground, reversing the afflictive chain is important. For those that have, it is the general Dependent\n908\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nOrigination that is important. Conventional it is dependent on causes and conditions but at the ultimate\nlevel it is just spontaneous presence. Tsongkhapa’s Prasangika [Madhyamaka] refines a lot of my view.” -\nJohn Tan, 2019\n\"If asked what I am most drawn to (in Tsongkhapa's teachings), I am most drawn to Prasangika's \"mere\nimputation\". The quintessence of \"mere imputation\" is IMO the essence of Buddhism. It is the whole of 2\ntruths; the whole of 2 folds. How the masters present and how it is being taught is entirely another matter.\nIt is because in non-conceptuality, the whole of the structure of \"mere imputation\" is totally exerted into an\ninstantaneous appearance that we are unable to see the truth of it. In conceptuality, it is expanded and\nrealized to be in that structure. A structure that awakens us the living truth of emptiness and dependent\narising that is difficult to see in dimensionless appearance.\"\n\"In ultimate (empty dimensionless appearance), there is no trace of causes and conditions, just a single\nsphere of suchness. In relative, there is dependent arising. Therefore distinct in relative when expressed\nconventionally but seamlessly non-dual in ultimate.\"\n\"When suchness is expressed relatively, it is dependent arising. Dependent designation in addition to causal\ndependency is to bring out a deeper aspect when one sees thoroughly that if phenomena is profoundly\nwithout essence then it is always only dependent designations.\" - John Tan, 2015\n“There are at least 5 phases of total exertion.

Feel\nhow is post anatta like, how do you feel?\n911\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[9:07 PM, 6/16/2020] Soh Wei Yu: non division, luminous, gapless, no distance... in the seen merely the\nseen is experienced as luminous and gapless. also another aspect is spontaneous.. i always talk about\nspontaneous happening, agentless, doerless, perceiverless.. and also dependent on conditions\n[9:07 PM, 6/16/2020] Soh Wei Yu: but not total exertion or emptiness yet\n[9:08 PM, 6/16/2020] Soh Wei Yu: no agent, nondual, luminosity, spontaneous and dependent on\nconditions”\n“Purpose of Deconstruction and Dependent Origination\n[2:13 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Actually my experience is always vibrant presencing.. just a matter of\ndegree.. like getting lost in thought also affects, not enough shamatha. There are probably some other\nobscurations but i dont understand yet\n[2:13 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Yes\n[2:13 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: No mind is a direct insight for me on anatta\n[2:13 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: So what exactly is obscuring is what I am asking you...\n[2:13 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: There is no mind and all is mind simultaneously\n[2:13 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Now if I asked you do you know what DO is all about?\n[2:15 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: If I say A is causally connect to be what is it really talking about? And when\nI ask A is empty and be is empty and so is the causal connection between them. What does it mean?\n[2:15 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Saying theyare empty doesn't mean anything at all. What is the insight and\nwisdom from deconstructing them.\n[2:16 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Further I have been asking you what is the purpose of deconstruction?\n[2:16 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: And why is view important is deconstruction is everything.\n[2:16 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Therefore when you answer andre, your points aren't clear.\n[2:17 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Having insight of anatta is one thing, having insight of DO is another.\n[2:18 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Having deconstruction doesn't mean DO. Advaita practitioner deconstruct\nself, but why they did not see DO? That is the question.\n[2:19 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Now, in Tibetan practice, conceptualization is as if the root of all evils but\nis it? you have to have your own insights and experiences to authenticate the truth of it.\n[2:21 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Why is view important when you need deconstruction? So understand the\npurpose of deconstruction and understand the view when you have direct insight of anatta to help you.\n[2:28 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Advaita subsume everything into one. So their deconstruction leads to\ncollapsing into undifferentiated oneness which has the characteristics of permanence and Self\nWhereas buddhism deconstructs Self and sees self and all phenomena like chariot.. so it collapses\noneness into multiplicity and then the nature of multiplicity is revealed to be dependent origination and\nnon arising, neither one or many, etc\n[2:30 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Subsuming into one, why?\n[2:31 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: If deconstruction frees one from conceptualizing, how is it that there's\nsubsuming?\n[2:40 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Because after I AM the I AM appears like ultimate reality. So it does not\n912\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\noccur to them that the view of subjectivity can be seen through via insight\n[2:41 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: They do not even see subjectivity as a view\n[2:41 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: To them its the absolute\n[2:43 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Therefore this not seeing is the root of ignorance. So don't see mind or\nnot mind doesn't imply insight.\n[2:43 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic.. But for me all observable phenomena are awareness and there is no\nawareness besides observable phenomena, this is from direct insight\n[2:48 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: When one over emphasizes non conceptualization as the ultimate goal, he\nis letting karmic blind spots sway his understanding.\n[2:52 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: So as I have said many times, despite having experiences turned\neffortlessly non-dual and non conceptual post anatta, I am not into no view. Rather I am into direct\nauthentication of right view.\n[2:54 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n[2:58 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: This however is not promoting conceptualization over non- conceptual\nexperience. They support each other.\n[3:00 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Why do I ask you what is the purpose of deconstruction? You need to\nknow what exactly does deconstruction achieve. You have deconstructed mind, body and divisions...so\nwhat is this deconstruction about and what is the purpose?\n[3:02 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Experience presence without boundary and artificial separation or\nfragmentation\n[3:08 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Yes. To access directly presence without intermediary. Having direct\naccess does not mean wisdom and insight will arise. But when you are able to to access the state of non-\ndual presence, you are able to authenticate the view so that you insight may arise.\n[3:09 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n[3:12 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: So the view, the experience and the realization.\n[3:17 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Now what is dependent origination about? Is it relation between 2 things?\nIf not what is it pointing at?\n[3:26 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: It is pointing to the nature of this presencing appearance.. because we\ndo not comprehend the nature of appearance we come up with the idea that things come into existence\nand abides somewhere for a moment or a while... but when we look into appearance, appearance is none\nother than the various conditions exerting, like for example the image on screen is dependent on eye,\nelectricity, etc.. you can’t say it has been created and is locatable somewhere. it is none other than a\nseamless exertion just like chariot is none other than the parts dependencies functions\nIt is not relation between two things because the depending and depended are not one or two.. the vision\nis not vision of its own apart from eye.. eye is not eye on its own apart from vision.. it is the nature of this\npresencing vision to be dependent and non originating\n[8:02 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Quite good.\n[8:05 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: But DO must been seen and understood from conventional perspective.\nHow it serves as antidote for the conventional fictions of the mind.\n913\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[4:05 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: https://youtu.be/BFebcvam2N0\n[7:41 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Lol he speaks of the view, experience, realization\n[8:01 PM, 6/19/2020] John Tan: Seems like he enjoys the one hand clapping koan. There is no mirror.\n[8:02 PM, 6/19/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Yeah..\nLabels: Deconstruction, Dependent Origination |”\n“The Total Exertion of Success\n[12:27 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: As for the deconstruction process via total exertion, a more effective way\nwill be contemplating the ayatanas (Soh: See https://suttacentral.net/mn148/en/bodhi) and\nconsciousness sort of deconstruction..\nAs I told you the insight trigger from \"hearer hearing sound\" and \"ear, sound, ear-consciousness\" are\ndifferent. Also \"ear, sound, ear-consciousness\" imo is post anatta into phenomena and action.\n[12:28 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. but ear sound ear consciousness is before deconstruction of ear\nand sound into total exertion right\n[12:34 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Post anatta, you are left with sound. When you look at sound from \"ear,\nsound, ear-consciousness\" we are led to total exertion.\n[12:38 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: But before you talk about total exertion let's look at fluxing...\nBuddha named consciousness after its ayatanas. This is to prevent us from abstracting and reifying a\npure self standing consciousness. In other words, consciousness is in a perpetual state of fluxing and if\nyou where to slice a moment out of this stream of consciousness-ing, it is always one of the six types of\nconsciousness -- eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness,\nbody-consciousness and mental-consciousness.\n[12:40 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n[12:41 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Now what is that ear-consciousness?\n[12:42 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Cannot be spoken besides in relation to ear and sound.. it is just that\nsound in relation to ear, manifesting that sound consciousness\n[12:51 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Yes. If I were to hit a bell with a stick and produce a \"tingssss\"\nsound...where and what is that \"tingss\"?\nIs it in the stick, the bell, the air, the vibration of the air, the ear canal, the eardrum?\nAlso is that \"tingss\" produced? Is it caused?\n[12:53 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: And if you take out a part of the conditions, is there still \"tingss\" at that\nmoment?\n[12:54 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: No\n[12:55 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: It is relational but not produced or caused\n[1:00 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: The conventional world is populated with discrete separated objects as\n914\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nthe mind sees in bits and pieces and languages play a role in enforcing the hoax of separations.\nWe link these separated objects and say this causes that. We must see through all these symbols and\nnames constructs and cause and effect issues, not just no-self.\n[1:08 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: When you say no? are you able to see how and why it is \"no\"? Like\nchoosing, without all its parts, is it still that choosing?\nWhen you flip a coin, can you flip the head without flipping the tail? When you flip the head, you are at the\nsame time flipping the tail. So can the tail choose not to be flipped?\nWhen we say sensation, sensation is always the sensation of something. Can there be sensation without\nan object? And we say sensation is not free from that something?\n[1:20 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic.. yeah.. nothing can be found besides those relations. Sensation of\nheat cannot be found to reside somewhere besides the exertion of hand grasping on the cup and the hot\ncoffee, etc etc.. Therefore unproduced, not inherent production or cause and effect... If produced then it\ncould exist apart from those relations. Choosing also cannot be found besides the relations which volition\nplays an important role.. volition etc too is dependently originating. It is not determinism which is a kind\nof fixed view of inherent production, just dependent origination\n[1:27 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Choosing is dependent on choosable objects, the subjective mental\nfactors which includes ignorance, afflictions, habits, or conversely wisdom, mindfulness, willpower,\nexternal influences, internal rational reasoning, etc etc.. all those factors exerting in the activity of\nchoosing\n[1:27 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: It is not exactly important how words are being replaced but what exactly\nis \"uprooted\" from the process of decosntruction. It must lift the veil of \"production\" and separation,\nentity and it's characteristics to understand the vivid vibrancy of that \"tingss\"...\nSo there can be a direct pointing that enables one to taste without intermediary beyond names and\nforms of that \"tingsss\", a non-dual, non-local or total exerted experience, but that does not mean the\nintellectual blindspot is uprooted.\nThere can also be clear understanding of intellectually but somehow the blindspot is not lifted and a\nsecond pointing into the taste of clarity is needed.\n[1:30 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: So direct experience is one thing, clearly seeing through and uprooting of\nthe blindspots is altogether another question.\n[1:40 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[1:42 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: When I say soh is very successful, a damn good programmer. So when\nyou look at \"success\" and see through this label, what did you see?\n[1:43 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Just suddenly successful?\n[1:43 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: No.. years of gaining experience etc\n[1:43 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Tell me more\n915\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[1:43 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Everything ...\n[1:43 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Go into it...\n[1:46 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: It includes learning from teachers, working with others, learning from\nfailures and mistakes, continually refining knowledge and learning, and experience, hmm... actually\ncannot finish listing all the factors lol..\n[1:47 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Yes...that includes coding ten of thousands of lines of codes, many\nsleepless nights, continual refining ones logic...etc\n[1:48 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: All of these all is being exerted into soh as a good programmer here and\nnow...\n[1:49 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: So success is designated based on these conditions\n[1:55 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: So soh that is here and now and the whole exertion, what is the\ndifference?\n[1:59 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: No difference\n[2:10 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: No difference how come?\n[2:13 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Here and now is just another designation... cannot be found besides the\nwhole exertion of ten directions and three times.. just like consciousness is named and designated after\nconditions\n[2:37 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: Similarly, when you studying an object A, you will soon find that you are\nnot just studying the object itself, you are at the same time studying it's environment, it's conditions...until\nthe line between the thing you study and it's environment and conditions become a blur...until the\nboundaries and the divisions dissapears ... What can you realize from that?\n[2:54 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: To study something is to study the relations and exertion of everything\ninvolved\nReminds me of dogen..\nTo study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to\nbe actualized by myriad things. When actualized by myriad things, your body and mind as well as the\nbodies and minds of others drop away. No trace of enlightenment remains, and this no-trace continues\nendlessly.\nDogen\n[3:14 PM, 6/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Also dependent designations.. everything is dependent designations\n[3:43 PM, 6/24/2020] John Tan: The Soh that is here and now and the whole exertion are not two different\nphenomena. The splitting up creates the impression as if they can be separated. As if you can choose\nsome part and still retain the same successful Soh at the moment. We also create a cause and effect\nrelationship as if Soh that is here and now is a puppet that can't do anything.\nLike the head and tail of a coin, they are two aspects of the same coin. The mind that sees the bits and\npieces and the language creates an alienated experience and confusions.\n916\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAll these deconstructions and uprooting of blindspots are to allow the full and total experience of the\nsound \"tingss\". Each moment is also the dynamic total participation of the entire situation of the three\ntimes.\nSo in the total exertion of that \"tingss\", there is no outside, no inside, therefore nothing to cause...no\ncause, no conditions, no self, no arising, no ceasing. Effortless, boundless, immense, vibrantly alive and\nfree.”\n“Alan Watts ~ The Unity Between You And The World\n[10:40 PM, 7/2/2020] Soh Wei Yu: https://youtu.be/USyvMGClNdY\n[10:40 PM, 7/2/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Nice talk by alan watts on net of indra and total exertion\n[10:53 PM, 7/2/2020] John Tan: Yes very good... Like the success\n[11:24 PM, 7/2/2020] John Tan: Because we are so used to seeing and understanding from a truly\nobjective world excluding consciousness from the equation or a subsuming consciousness which is just\nthe other end of the pole.\nSimilarly, we may think that we have to \"get out\" of conventionalities and be non-conceptual, non-dual,\nnon-local and live in vivid vibrancy prior to separation.\nWe think that the conventional world and the non-dual, non-conceptual must be mutually exclusive.\nWhat is the sound of one hand clapping in a fully and completely engaged conventional world?\nWhen you move not a single step away from concepts and names, conventions and forms, what is that\ntaste of one hand clapping like? Can you identify it?\n[11:28 PM, 7/2/2020] John Tan: But that is not to tell you to keep engaging in conceptual thoughts...lol\n[11:44 PM, 7/2/2020] John Tan: Sound makes ear, the ear and the ear makes sound, the sound. No\nsound, no ear. Neither prior nor after.\nThis you understand.\nBut what about Dogen hits a bell, soh hears it? How intimate and how deep have you embraced it?\n[11:47 AM, 7/3/2020] John Tan: There are at least 5 phases of total exertion. Each is a deepening.”\n“THE WORLD OF INTERRELATEDNESS\nThusness commented, \"Yes good stuff. \"Things\" are just set of relations.\nWhatever felt, seen, heard, tasted, smelled and thought that seem so real and awareness that is often\ntaken to be more \"real than real\" is no different from the \"chariot\" and its basis of designation.\"\nTHE WORLD OF INTERRELATEDNESS\n917\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nby Adyashanti\n“When you feel love or fall in love, that’s a very real feeling to you, and yet you can’t see it, you can’t\nweigh it; it doesn’t have any objective sort of existence. Nonetheless, we treat it as more real than the\nthings we consider to be real—certainly as more important.”\nWhen we think of interrelatedness, we usually think of big or small things that are in relationship with\none another. However, the way I’m using the word is not like that. I’m not denying that, but there is\nsomething deeper than that. Things are actually nothing but interrelatedness itself.\nIt’s really hard for a human mind to think that a thing could be nothing but interrelatedness, that\ninterrelatedness itself ends up to be what things actually are. In this sense, things end up to be no-things,\nand no-things end up to be all things. So when we hear words like no-thing or nothingness, we shouldn’t\ntry to understand that conventionally. In its truest sense, nothingness doesn’t have much to do with\nnothing. It has to do with interrelationship or interrelatedness.\nAnd so it is with each of us. When you look inside for your true being, you might say, “Okay, exactly,\nprecisely, what is this thing called ‘me’? What actually is it?” The more you look for it, the more you can’t\nfind it. The reason you can’t find it is because it is nothing but interrelatedness. There’s no substance.\nThere’s no thought, idea, or image to grasp. In that sense, it’s empty, but not empty in the sense of being\nnonexistent. It’s empty in the sense of being unexpected or inconceivable.\nWhen you feel love or fall in love, that’s a very real feeling to you, and yet you can’t see it, you can’t weigh\nit; it doesn’t have any objective sort of existence. Nonetheless, we treat it as more real than the things we\nconsider to be real—certainly as more important. Most people, if they feel love, their love feels more\nimportant to them than the solidity of their toaster. The love has no solidity to it at all. It has no objective\ntangibility to it, and yet, it’s something that one could orient their whole life around.\nThe Buddha used to talk about the thusness or suchness of each moment. It means not just each moment,\nbut the thusness or suchness of each apparent thing that we perceive. So when I say being, this is the sense\nI’m using it in, a similar way that the Buddha used the thusness or suchness of something. When we\nperceive the thusness or suchness of something, we’re actually perceiving it as being nothing but\ninterrelatedness itself. So this ordinary moment, with nothing particularly unusual about it, is being\nawareness, and awareness itself is interrelatedness. It’s not like interrelatedness is aware; it’s more like\ninterrelatedness is. It’s not that the interrelatedness is that which is aware—it’s that the interrelatedness is\nawareness.\nThis is probably the fundamental barrier that any of us will bump into in spirituality: the barrier between\nawareness and the objects of awareness. The fundamental duality is that there is this world of things, and\nthen there’s seeing and experiencing this world of things, and somehow those two are different. One of\nthe great misunderstandings about unity is the belief that it reduces the world to a sort of homogenized\n“goo” of agreement. Actually, in some ways it’s almost the opposite. It frees the uniqueness in you, and it\n918\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nfrees you to allow the uniqueness in others. Uniqueness flourishes when we see the unity of things. It\ndoesn’t get flattened out—just the opposite. You just stop arguing with the difference that isn’t like yours.\nWhen you have two viewpoints that are open to interrelating, almost always something will arise if you\nstick with it long enough, if you’re sincere, if you’re openhearted, if you actually want the truth more than\nyou want to win or be right. Eventually something will bubble up from that engagement that’s truer than\neither one began with. If you have two people who are openhearted and see the truth and usefulness,\neven the utility, of really relating, they’ll see that, and both people walk away feeling like “Gosh, I feel good\nabout that, like we both win because we both discovered more than we started with.”\nThe unity of things isn’t that there are no differences. It isn’t that a tree doesn’t look different than the sky,\nor behave differently than the sky, or have a different kind of life than the sky. The unity is that a tree—an\nobject—is nothing but interrelatedness. The sky is nothing but interrelatedness, and the awareness of\nthings is itself nothing but interrelatedness. That’s an explanation that is coming from a way of perceiving.\nThat’s what enlightenment really is: seeing that the seeing and what one is aware of are one simultaneous\narising. It’s an arising that’s always flowing because interrelatedness isn’t static—it’s ever flowing.\nThat’s why I’m always saying that this is really about a kind of vision, not in the sense of having visions, but\nthe quality of our vision, the quality of our perception when we can perceive without the dualistic filter.\nWhat seems to be this impenetrable sort of barrier between us and things, us and the world, us and each\nother, is fundamentally between our consciousness and what consciousness is conscious of. That\nseemingly basic and immovable sense that there is a fundamental difference, a fundamental separation,\nis what’s really dispelled when our insight gets deep enough.\nAt the deepest level, the most fundamental level, interrelationship is just that—it’s interrelating. It’s not\nthings interrelating. Things end up to be themselves interrelatedness. When vision becomes clear, that’s what\nwe perceive. The world becomes not a world of things, but of interrelatedness.\nExcerpted from “The World of Interrelatedness,” April 10, 2019 ~ Garrison, NY\nAvailable as an audio download, The World of Interrelatedness. “\n“[3/8/19, 1:23:25 PM] John Tan: However the [Adyashanti] article should not lump all into one.

More real than real is just luminosity right\n[3/8/19, 4:54:26 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Btw it occurred to me that advaita talks about non arising but the diff\nwith buddhism is that buddhism non arising is the rejection of inherent production due to being free\nfrom causation by self, others, both and causeless, which is to say everything is non arising and free from\n919\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\ninherent production due to dependent origination. Whereas in advaita everything is non arising due to\neverything being mere imputation and projection upon the inherently existing substratum of brahman\n[3/8/19, 5:06:41 PM] John Tan: Yes. That (More real than real) is also an insight that turns the mind\ninternal. Non-arising means appearances without essence similar to a reflection, like a rainbow. That\n(More real than real) comes with I AMness. The difference between anatta and substantiality is beside\nappearance, there is innate feeling of some essence separate from the appearances of colors, sensations,\nsound, smell, taste and thoughts. Therefore one cannot be fully open and release.”\nInseparability of Awareness and Conditions\n“(12:02 AM) AEN: btw the other day I asked you about what padmasambhava said\n‘Since (intrinsic awareness) is self-originated and spontaneously self-perfected without any antecedent\ncauses or conditions,’\nthen isn't it contradictory to D.O.?\n(12:04 AM) Thusness: padmasambhava is not referring to no causes and conditions\n(12:05 AM) AEN: oic then what he meant\n(12:05 AM) Thusness: he is referring to luminosity is not created. nothing is created. they dependently\noriginates. there is no creation of anything. that is what Buddhists have to understand\n(12:07 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:07 AM) Thusness: non buddhists reify a source that is non-created. only the source is not created… in\nbuddhism, there is no origination\n(12:08 AM) AEN: icic.. so non buddhist see source and everything originates from source while buddhism\ndoesnt see a source and origination?\n(12:09 AM) Thusness: yes.

This is also related to a previous blog entry Dependent Arising of Consciousness which\ncontains a related text by Arya Nagarjuna.\n---------------\nPasserby/Thusness saw some inadequateness in one of the Zen Patriarch Bodhidharma translations, and\ntranslated himself a certain passage and commented on my forum:\n920\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nOriginal Chinese text from Bodhidharma's Bloodstream Sermon (血脉论): 若智慧明了，此心号名法性，亦名\n解脱。生死不拘，一切法拘它不得，是名大自在王如来；亦名不思议，亦名圣体，亦名长生不死，亦名大仙。名\n虽不同，体即是一。圣人种种分别，皆不离自心。心量广大，应用无穷，应眼见色，应耳闻声，应鼻嗅香，应舌\n知味，乃至施为运动，皆是自心。\n(I myself translated certain parts to fill in the gap): With the illumination of wisdom (prajna), mind is\nknown as Dharma Nature, mind is known as Liberation. Neither life nor death can restrain this mind, no\ndharmas (phenomenon) can. It’s also called the King of Great Freedom Tathagata, the Incomprehensible,\nthe Holy Essence, the Immortality, the Great Immortal. Its names vary but its essence is one. Sages vary,\nbut none are separate from his own mind. The mind’s capacity is limitless, and its conditional functions\nare inexhaustible. With the condition of eyes, forms are seen, With the condition of ears, sounds are\nheard, With the condition of nose, smells are smelled, With the condition of tongue, tastes are tasted,\nevery movement or states are all one's Mind.\nComments by Passerby/Thusness:\n若智慧明了，此心号名法性，亦名解脱。\nA better way to translate this should be:\nWith the illumination of wisdom (prajna), mind is known as Dharma Nature, mind is known as Liberation.\nComments: It is important to know that mind is itself liberation. That is why knowing the nature of our\nmind is the way of liberation. If Liberation is not experienced, then the clarity is still not there. There is no\ntrue understanding of what mind is.\nLiberation is this Pristine Awareness itself in its natural state. That is why understanding this Pristine\nAwareness is the direct path towards liberation. If we cannot see that the 5 aggregates are themselves\nour Buddha Nature, then we will not understand there is nothing to shunt from the transience. Thought\nliberates, sound liberates, tastes liberates. The transience liberates. If we do not see that, then we are\ntaking a gradual path. It is also not advisable to speak too much about spontaneous arising or self\nliberation. It can be quite misleading.\n----------------\n应眼见色，应耳闻声，应鼻嗅香，应舌知味，乃至施为运动，皆是自心。\nA better way to translate should be:\n921\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWith the condition of the eye, forms are seen, With the condition of ears, sounds are heard, With the\ncondition of nose, smells are smelled, With the condition of tongue, tastes are tasted, every movement or\nstates are all one's Mind.\nThusness/Passerby's comments:\nHere there are 2 important points to take note. First is that Buddha Nature is the transience. Second it is\nmore of '应'. Means with the condition of the eye, forms arise. With ears, sound arises.\nAwareness is not like a mirror reflecting but rather a manifestation. Luminosity is an arising luminous\nmanifestation rather than a mirror reflecting. The center here is being replaced with Dependent\nOrigination, the experience however is non-dual.\nOne must learn how to see Appearances as Awareness and all others as conditions. Example, sound is\nawareness. The person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, ears...are conditions. One should learn to see in this\nway. All problems arise because we cannot experience Awareness this way.\nConventionally we experience in the form of subject and object interaction taking place in a space-time\ncontinuum. This is just an assumption. Experientially it is not so. One should learn to experience\nawareness as the manifestation. There is no subject, there is only and always manifestation, all else are\nconditions of arising. All these are just provisional explanations for one to understand.\nFurther comments:\nWhat's seen is Awareness. What's heard is Awareness. All experiences are non-dual in nature. However\nthis non-dual luminosity cannot be understood apart from the ‘causes and conditions’ of arising.\nTherefore do not see ‘yin’ as Awareness interacting with external conditions. If you see it as so, then it still\nfalls in the category of mirror-reflecting. Rather see it as an instantaneous manifestation where nothing is\nexcluded. As if the universe is giving its very best for this moment to arise. A moment is complete and\nnon-dual. Vividly manifest and thoroughly gone leaving no traces.\nOther comments:\nPhrase like “everything arises from Emptiness and subsides back to Emptiness” is equally misleading. By\ndoing so, we have made ‘Emptiness’ into a metaphysical essence; similarly not to make the same mistake\nfor “causes and conditions”, not to objectify it into a metaphysical essence. All are provisional terms to\npoint to our insubstantial, essence-less and interdependent nature.”\nWritings by Dzogchen teacher Arcaya Malcolm,\n922\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“Malcolm wrote:\nYes, I understand. All awarenesses are conditioned. There is no such thing as a universal undifferentiated\nultimate awareness in Buddhadharma. Even the omniscience of a Buddha arises from a cause.\nPadmaVonSamba wrote:\nisn't this cause, too, an object of awareness? Isn't there awareness of this cause? If awareness of this\ncause is awareness itself, then isn't this awareness of awareness? What causes awareness of awareness,\nif not awareness?\nIf awareness is the cause of awareness, isn't it its own cause?\nMalcolm wrote:\nOmniscience is the content of a mind freed of afflictions. Even the continuum of a Buddha has a relative\nground, i.e. a the rosary or string of moments of clarity is beginingless.\nOrigination from self is axiomatically negated in Buddhadharma,\nEach moment in the continuum of a knowing clarity is neither the same as nor different than the previous\nmoment. Hence the cause of a given instant of a knowing clarity cannot be construed to be itself nor can\nit be construed to be other than itself. This is the only version of causation which, in the final analysis,\nBuddhadharma can admit to on a relative level. It is the logical consequence of the Buddha's insight,\n\"When this exists, that exists, with the arising of that, this arose.\"\nPadmaVonSamba wrote:\nI am not referring to cognition, rather, the causes of that cognition.\nMalcolm wrote:\nCognitions arise based on previous cognitions. That's all.\nIf you suggest anything other than this, you wind up in Hindu La la land.\nMalcolm wrote:\nThere is no such thing as a universal undifferentiated ultimate awareness in Buddhadharma.” - Take from\na well written article https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2014/02/clarifications-on-dharmakaya-and-\nbasis_16.html Clarifications on Dharmakaya and Basis by Loppön Namdrol/Malcolm\n2008:\n(3:53 PM) AEN: hmm ya joan tollifson said: This open being is not something to be practiced methodically.\n923\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nToni points out that it takes no effort to hear the sounds in the room; it's all here.

Awareness and the sound of a plane are here\nwith no one in the middle trying to \"do\" them or bring them together. They are here together!

One must re-orientate oneself that it is functionality and action that give rise to\n[the sense of a] self/entity rather than [a real] agent giving rise to action. Therefore from anatta, we see\nDependent Origination, cause and conditions, action, karma... unlike [the misunderstanding of] no-self\ntherefore no dependent origination and causality. The former is non-substantialist view, the latter is using\nsubstantialist self view to understand anatta (no-self).\" - John Tan, 2015\n“Karmic propensities are habitual tendencies of perception and behavior which are predicated upon\nignorance [avidyā].\nThe three poisons are a succinct example of this: (i) ignorance [skt. avidyā/moha], (ii) acceptance [skt.\nrāga], (iii) rejection [skt. dvesa].\nAcceptance and rejection are the karmic tendencies which are based on the initial ignorance. One is\nignorant of the fact that phenomena ultimately lack any essence or substantiality and therefore\nappearances are mistaken to be existent objects. Attachment/acceptance of those apparent objects and\nor aversion/rejection of those alleged objects creates the illusion of a subjective entity which is doing the\naccepting and/or rejecting.\n925\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSo the action [karma] itself gives rise to the delusion of an autonomous entity and that delusion is further\nengrained and fortified through continual action/activity in the same vein.\nThis process is the foundation and sustenance of samsara. The cause is the ignorance And the conditions\nare the proliferation of karmic tendencies, e.g. accepting and rejecting.” – Kyle Dixon, 2015\n\"...prior to anatta and emptiness realizations the perception of an external dimension populated with\nobjects and entities that possess characteristics and perform functions as instruments or agents is an\nunerring fact of experience. As is the apparent internal point of reference. These structures are simply in\nplace, at all times.\nOnly after anatta and emptiness is this directly discovered to be false.\" - Kyle Dixon, 2019\n\"That phenomena appear to be real is not an advanced philosophical view. It is just a fact of life for\npeople.\nPeople experience objects, persons, places, things as established entities and so on.\nThey form attachment to persons, places and things. They form aversion to other persons, places and\nthings. Attachment to experiences, aversion to experiences.\nFor common people this is all based on a cognition of real persons, places and things.\nThings that appear unreal to people, again such as dream appearances, mirages, reflections,\nhallucinations, echoes, are not a basis for attachment and aversion because they are known to be\ninsubstantial appearances.\" - Kyle Dixon, 2019\n“This sort of gets into the whole \"cause and condition\" side of this equation, where the perception of real\nentities (persons, places, things, etc.) is caused by a certain type of ignorance. And that being the case, the\nvery cognition of real entities (or what is called \"conditioned phenomena\" such as an internal, personal\nself, or external, impersonal objects) quite literally arises because of that ignorance and is therefore\nfundamentally no different than that ignorance. And in this sense, when one realizes that said apparently\nreal entities are actually empty of inherency, that realization or epiphany is really just a cessation of cause\n[ignorance] for the arising of the perception of those entities. Meaning; it is simply a cessation of\nignorance.\nIn that way there is either the presence of ignorance, and the results of ignorance, or the cessation of\nignorance and the results of that cessation, but an underlying, substantial nature (like we would find in\nVedanta) is not part of that process.” - Kyle Dixon, Dzogchen vs Advaita, Conventional and Ultimate Truth\n926\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“I'm not sure about the 'everything arising from rigpa' but Tsoknyi Rinpoche's comments regarding rigpa\n(Soh: Rigpa means ‘knowledge’ or vidya, particularly of the true nature of mind/phenomena) completely\npervading all things, and by understanding rigpa you understand all phenomena... are pointing to the fact\nthat once recognition of one's nature has occurred, the delusion that apperceives phenomena as\nobjectively arising qualities of experience which appear to a mind, is overcome.\nSo that is to say, the recognition of rigpa is essentially the very first time one's experience is known\naccurately, and that knowledge is then the foundation for one's practice in dzogchen. It's not only the\nrefutation that appearances are the samsaric dualistic mind, but the very idea that appearances and\nphenomena are subsumed into the mind or consciousness. It's the notion that the objective phenomena\nare non-dual with a subjective mind or consciousness, and that there is a union of those polarities.\nThe Dzogchen view is that both the mind/consciousness and the objective appearances are byproducts of\ndelusion, just as Longchenpa says in the quote above; \"Likewise, various kinds of phenomena are\nappearing in the deluded mind because of the interdependent origination of the causes and conditions of\ndelusion.\" The mind/consciousness and phenomena viewed as objective, separate or subsumed within\nthat mind are both products of delusion, grasping and clinging, imputation and conceptualization etc. The\nmoment a mind or consciousness is posited, that which is not-that-mind arises, that is the dependent\norigination.\nThe idea is to see that the mind/consciousness and the phenomena are dependently originated and\ntherefore both are rendered empty if that is ascertained successfully. Also, nothing truly arises from the\nbasis (gzhi), the basis simply displays it's appearance as the five lights, but since that spontaneously and\nnaturally formed display (lhun grub) is primordially pure (ka dag) it's not established (nor unestablished)\nin any way. Only when that display isn't recognized to be self-display, does phenomena arise.\nThe basis is never involved in delusion in any way nor does it display delusion, delusion arises due to non-\nrecognition. The recognition of rigpa is simply the knowledge or discernment which results from\nascertaining the display of the basis to be self-display. The Mahamudra instructions which say 'everything\nis mind' is usually a line of reasoning which runs like so: 'everything is mind, mind is empty' so it's a way of\nhelping the aspirant to achieve recognition (if recognition didn't occur in direct introduction).\nEverything is the mind deems everything as nondual with the mind, and then the mind is empty i.e.\ninsubstantial, unfindable, unestablished. It's just a way to say that which you perceive as 'objective\nphenomena' is truly neither the same nor different than the mind, both are imputed designations. Since\ndzogchen is resting in rigpa, the nature of the mind has already been recognized and so its emptiness is\nimplicit in the view to begin with.” - Kyle Dixon, 2013\n“...penetrate deeply into the following aspects:\n927\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n1. The amazing power of the spell of an arising thought\nClearly understand the power and implications of this arising thought. It is the mystery of all mysteries.\nWhen this arising thought sees dualistically and inherent, everything appears infinitely separated and\napart. That is all that matters.\n2. Look deeply into the cause of suffering as a result of dualistic and inherent thought rather than\nthought self liberates, penetrate the ‘cause and conditions’ of suffering.\nWhen an arising thought see dualistically, how the entire experience is shaped.\nWhen an arising thought sees inherently, how the entire experience has changed.\nWith this as the cause, what happens, with the absence of that, what happens.\n3. There is no willing off of dualistic and inherent thought, that would be self-view. If there is no doership,\nis overcoming possible?\nFrom this understanding, an arising thought is not just an arising thought, but the total exertion and\nentire chain of conditionality is in action. Clearly understand the difference between self-view and\nprinciple of conditionality with direct experience. The overcoming is not by way of self-view approach but\nby understanding the principle of conditionality.” - John Tan, 2012\n“Total Exertion of Karmic Tendencies\nKarmic propensity is the whole of one's experiential reality. If one feels like a changeless witness, that\nexperience of feeling like a changeless witness IS that propensity in action, in experience... if one is seeing\nfully that there's only transience (the radiant flow of sights/sounds/smells/taste/touch/thoughts), that is\nthe actualization of wisdom (of anatta).\nIf one sees manifestation but appears solid, that's also the view of latent tendency, that view of inherent\nexistence in action. That very feeling of concreteness IS karmic tendency. If one sees this very presence\n(of any experience - sight, sound, smell, etc) is empty of any it-ness, concreteness, solidity, apparent yet\nempty, that very vision itself is the actualization of wisdom, it is the total exertion of wisdom, it IS wisdom.\nOr as Dzogchen puts it - those very five elements (space, wind, fire, water, earth) are wisdoms by nature,\nso experienced in its actual state, is that actualization of wisdom.\nIn a way, the view is the experience... every samsaric experience is the total exertion of ignorance along\nwith the 12 links in a single moment. Occasionally ignorant view is forgotten in a peak experience, such a\ncessation is however non-analytical and merely a passing state, as the conditions for the re-emergence of\n928\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nignorance and afflictions have not been cut off from its roots. Only the analytical cessation resulting from\npenetrative prajna wisdom of twofold emptiness can lead to a permanent and quantum shift of\nperception away from ignorance, what Lankavatara Sutra calls the \"turning-about\" in the deepest seat of\nconsciousness (but again this deepest seat is not somewhere else but fully manifesting!).\nSo the karmic tendency, and wisdom, you've been searching for has never been elsewhere but is staring\nright in your face as your experiential reality all along! Funny how one doesn't see that. That very activity\nthat is mentally fabricated but appearing real as one's only experiential reality at that given moment, just\nthat is the spell of karmic tendency. That activity that is (experienced/seen as) luminous and empty as\none's only experiential reality at that given moment is the wisdom.\nI remember when Ciaran (of Ruthless Truth) saw the real fiction of self (a process of creative imagination\nbrought into real life, a real creation based on an imaginary character) he wrote that it was a \"zen on\ndrugs\" moment. Yeah, I can see why he said that!\nJohn commented, \"Very good, so the dreams in dreams\n(https://www.awakeningtoreality.com.au/2012/06/buddha-dharma-dream-in-dream.html). Otherwise you\nare seeing clarity as empty and tendencies as inherent... hiding somewhere.” - Soh, 2013\nFrom a 2007 article that Soh wrote as a rehash of what John Tan wrote:\n“The Spell of Karmic Propensities\nThe following article is a summary (by me) of some of the conversations Thusness had with me on the topic of\nKarmic Propensities/Karmic Momentum/Deep Conditionings and how it blinds us and completely affects the\nway we see phenomena.\nKarmic Propensities is what blinded us from seeing the ultimate reality. Our entire mind is affected by\nkarmic propensities such that our entire system of enquiry, even when we want to inquire on reality, we\ncannot know beyond \"Who\", \"When\", \"What\", \"Where\". Our mind is always thinking dualistically, in terms\nof subject and object (an I and a Not-I/an Observer apart from the Object of Observation, which cannot be\nfound in reality). It is a momentum that cannot be located, yet it can be directly felt and experienced, and\nthe momentum arises every moment and affect the entire way we see things. When we are affected by\nmomentum the mind cannot know the ultimate reality (Emptiness).\nBecause our momentum is at work, we will always assume a subject-object duality. That is, there is a Self,\nan Agent, and observer, doer, thinker of thoughts. A self that persists in time in a connected way...\nexperiencing things... It blinds us into seeing self and objective world as 'entities', as 'things' with inherent\nexistence, as a separate and permanent 'me'.\n929\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSo when momentum is in action, we cannot help but react with our karmic patterns. If we were to ask, \"If\nyou lost your shoe, are you still you?\" or \"If you lost your hands, do you still exist?\". It almost seems\ncertain to say \"Yes, of course I am still I.\" because we always assumed there is a truly existing \"Self\"\nexperiencing changes. This momentum can continue even after experiences of transcendental Presence,\nand distorting the experience.\nDharma Dan calls the karmic propensities of seeing subject/object division, or a separate Agent that is the\nobserver, the \"fundamental knot of perception\". (See: The Non-Duality Models of Enlightenment by\nDharma Dan)\nBecause it is our habit energy that made us think that way, we are so used to thinking in terms of subject-\nobject duality that it has become so deeply part of us, deeply imprinted into our consciousness.\nApart from understanding our non-dual nature, what is important is the question of why is there a\nseparation in the first place. Why is it that practitioners of all ages see thoughts, sensation, transience, the\nimpermanence as not our Buddha Nature itself? Even when told non-duality, explained and experienced,\nhow is it that it is not known? Understanding the power that blinds is equally important.\nAs my friend Longchen said, it's the working of the imprints and subtle recalling that makes us sink back\nto the illusion of a permanent background Source, Witness, Self... separating into form and formless,\nimpermanence and permanence, and thus fail to see that the Appearance is the Source.\nhttp://www.dreamdatum.com/no-eternalwitness.html\n...From deep meditative observation, the witness is realised to be just an impression that is\ncaused by subtle knowingness and sequential observation. Moment to moment arises in\nlightning fast speed. The second moment got a subtle imprint of the recently preceded one.\nThis sequential change causes the sense of Subtle Witnessing known as the Eternal Witness...\nIf we were to eliminate this bond, then we can begin to realise, there is no \"Self\". In reality, there is only\nSelf1, Self2, Self3 (which are not self), moment to moment our mental and karmic factors arise\nspontaneously but not in a connected way. We are not a permanent self, life is just a vivid, alive, yet\nmomentary and insubstantial stream of mental and physical phenomena and nothing stays, everything is\never flowing. (Also see What is Self? and What Is The \"Me\"?)\nWithout seeing things as 'entities', we can begin to realise the nature of Dependent Co-Arising,\nConditionality, Interdependence, etc, i.e Emptiness. The nature is always so, but our karmic propensities\nobscure us from seeing the truth, distorting the way we see things, enquire things, and perceive things. It\nis this bond that bonds us life after life in Samsara.\nTo eliminate the bond we have to feel it, feel the power of the bond, experience it. To eliminate the bond\nis a matter of insights, the insight into our true nature, the insight into self-liberation, etc. Not only must\n930\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nwe eliminate the bond, we must be able to see how \"Propensities\" blinds us, and that is through naked\nawareness.\nHow can naked awareness lead to the insight of our \"Propensities\"?\nSpace, time, life, death, in and out are all ‘deeply held’ impressions. We are seldom aware of the “deeply\nheld” until we are able to rest adequately in naked awareness. The nakedness creates the big contrast\nthat provides us the condition for the arising of the insight of the 'deeply held'. The insight into the full\npower of our ‘propensities’ and resting in naked awareness are both equally crucial in our understanding\nof our non-dual (no subject-object duality, no separate permanently existing self) and empty\n(interdependently originated) nature.\nTo consciousness 'propensities' (deep conditioning or imprints) are all that matters. It is the only 'force'\nthat blinds, bonds and prevents a liberating experience. Once formed it remains latent and only surface\nwhen conditions are riped for fruition. We are unable to get rid of it by will. Therefore to know\nconsciousness, it is also to know the impact of deep conditioning, how it is formed and how it subsides.\nThere is really no 'why', it is just how consciousness works.\nIf we drop our body, we experience astral body.\nIf we drop our thoughts, we experience “I AM”.\nIf we drop ‘I’, we experience non-duality.\nEvery major dropping results in a totally new experiential reality. Perhaps that is why Lao Tze teaches us\nto eliminate until none to experience Tao.\nTo drop the bondage/deep conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another way of 'knowing' is\npossible; an effortless, total sensing and experience of wholeness. Next the experiences of the joy, bliss\nand clarity of wholeness. Without the insight into the possiblity and the experience of the positive factors,\nthe mind will not release itself from holding.\nEven open pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind chatters incessantly. Every\nwhat, when, where and why by itself is a distancing from start. Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry\naka 'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced for the 'willingness' to arise.\nP.S. there are different types of meditative bliss/joy/rapture.\nLike samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss associated with certain level of\nconcentration; the bliss experienced from insight into our nature differs.\nThe happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from that experienced by a\npractitioner. “I AMness” is a higher form of happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously\nchatters. It is a level of bliss associated with a state of ‘transcendence’ – a state of bliss resulting from the\nexperience of “formlessness, odorless, colorless, attributeless and thoughtlessness’.\n931\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nNo-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct experience of Oneness and no-\nseparation. It is related to the dropping of the ‘I’. When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a\nform transcendence-oneness. It is what Thusness called the transparency of non-duality.”\n“Also, the afflictive chain is released by the pacification of mental proliferation but not through dry non-\nconceptuality. Like what you said can be by:\n■ Direct insight of anatta into empty clarity.\n■ Total exertion.\n■ However in total exertion, doing away with self is not necessary. It is fully embraced and\nfully authenticated by 10 thousand things. Most of your articles seem quite persistent in\ntrying to get rid of “self” even when expressing total exertion. In total exertion, emptiness\nand endless dependencies of dharma (including self) are a given otherwise total exertion is\nnot possible. Every dharma is purified by its own endless dependencies.\n■ Persistently seeing of whatever arises dependently is free from extremes will eventually free the\nmind. Consistently seeing neither self nor no-self, neither arise nor not-arise, breaks the chain of\nmental proliferation.” - John Tan\n“John Tan wrote:\nCan't understand him. This aside, recently he posted some extracts about selflessness written by Khenpo\nTsultrim Gyamtso:\n\"When we realize the selflessness of the individual, however, this whole process stops. The wrong views\nthat have their root in the belief in self cease, then the mental afflictions cease, then karmic actions cease,\nand as a result of that, birth in samsara’s cycle of existence ceases.\"\n\"We can formulate the following logical reasoning: Karmic actions and results are mere appearances\ndevoid of true existence, because no self, no actor, exists to perform them. This is a valid way to put\nthings because if the self of the individual does not exist, there cannot be any action, and therefore there\ncannot be any result of any action either.\"\nWould like to hear your view Kyle, that because there is no-self, there is no action.\nFrankly this is not inline with the experience and insight of anatta I have. I seriously cannot accept Mr. J's\n\"because there is no self, there is nothing to do\". I resonate more with Buddhaghosa's 'Suffering as such\nexists, but no sufferer is found; The deeds are, but no doer is found.'\nKyle Dixon replied:\n932\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nI was thinking about these comments from KTG just the other day because I saw Mr. J post them, they do\nseem off.\nThe only guess I have regarding the first quote is that he is referring to the complete realization of\nselflessness, not a mere recognition. It would not be right to think all of those processes cease upon initial\nrecognition, but that is of course how Mr. J misinterpreted the excerpt. I don't have the text, but I can\nimagine there is more context that is missing.\nAs for the other quote, it isn't the best way to communicate the message in my opinion.\nMy view is that the self is imputed onto the action or afflicted activity. And the activity is the result of\nignorance. First there is ignorance regarding the nature of appearance, and appearances are mistaken to\nbe external, whereas mind is then internal. From there further grasping occurs which fortifies this split,\nand the alleged inner reference point is then treated as mine and myself, which leads to I-making in the\nform of imputation. That activity of imputation then further deepens the fallacious structure of self and\nother because activity unfolds based on the misconception of the self.\nBut the self is not the lynchpin. Ignorance is. Is the self and ignorance synonymous? I don't think so.\nBecause ignorance is two fold in that it reifies the apparent inner dimension and external dimension. The\nself that karma is related hto is the mind reified as self. We can recognize non-arising related to that\nsubstrate knower, and still perceive a substantial external dimension. Likewise we can recognize non-\narising of objects in the external dimension and the inner substrate knower remains in tact. Then, we can\nalso recognize the non-arising in different sensory gates at different times. For instance one can\nrecognize the non-arising of sound yet visual perception remains afflicted, and vice versa.\nSo it isn't as simple as just negating the self and washing our hands of the massive nexus of afflictive\nprocesses. It is much more complex than that.\nIs it true that the self is unreal and the activity base on the self is unreal? Sure. But KTG is sort of\ncommunicating this in a backwards fashion. Just because the self is unreal does not mean it is not\nconstructed and based on a complex nexus of afflictive activity, that is then based in delusion. And that\nactivity is habitual.\nThis is why Padmasambhava says my view is higher than the sky but my attention to karmic cause and\neffect is finer than flour.\nThe karmic cause and effect is the patterns of grasping that reinforces the inner and outer yings or\ndimensions.\n933\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nKTG's message is true in a certain context, but is communicated recklessly. And of course the nuance of\nthe issue are completely lost on you-know-who. I feel he has had some coarse insights into substantial\nnon-dual states, maybe. But he has never really seen equipoise. This is my feeling.\nThe self does not create the fundamental afflictive activity. The fundamental afflictive activity gives rise to\nthe self, and then both spin out of control from there. But one will not resolve the affliction by merely\nnegating the self.\nKyle Dixon replied:\nAnatta equipoise is related to absence of time, and in this sense action is indeed negated. Also the\nthreefold actor, action, acted upon is undone when the insight is twofold. Anatta in objects is related to\nunreality of space. But only Buddhas are in non-retroactive state of that nature.\nJohn Tan replied:\nYes Kyle, like you said it is not so straight forward and logical deduction can be slippery. Does freedom\nfrom subject/object duality necessarily frees one from \"mine\" attachment?\n\"First there is the ignorance regarding the nature appearance and appearances are mistaken to be\nexternal whereas mind is then internal. \"\nMy view is this misapprehension is the result of ignorance but grasping need not arise. That is, I/others,\nsubject/object are not the result of grasping but a non-recognition. However when \"mine\" arises, that is\ngrasping.\nKyle Dixon replied:\nI agree that the feeling of subject-object precedes grasping and \"mine.\"\nIn some systems there is actually a tiered model of ignorance for this very reason, and that simple non-\nrecognition is treated as a different aspect of ignorance. That bare non-recognizing ignorance is\nsometimes illustrated in the example of the first instances when waking up from sleep where one is\ncognizing appearances, and those appearances are externalized, but self-identification has not arisen yet.\nI've had these moments extend to where I will wake up and it takes a few moments to even register\nwhere I am, yet bare cognizance is certainly functioning. Then imputation arises and recollection of\nperson, place, time, plans, schedule etc., all unfold, which is held as a different type of ignorance.”\n934\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“I’m obviously preferable to the Dzogchen system because I started there and although branching out, my\nprimary interest has remained there. But I do appreciate the run-down of avidyā or ignorance in the\nDzogchen system because it is tiered and accounts for this disparity I am addressing.\nThere are two or three levels of ignorance which are more like aspects of our delusion regarding the\nnature of phenomena. The point of interest in that is the separation of what is called “innate” (or\n“connate”) ignorance, from what is called “imputing ignorance.”\nThe imputing ignorance is the designating of various entities, dimension of experience and so on. And\none’s identity results from that activity.\nThe connate ignorance is the failure to correctly apprehend the nature of phenomena. The very non-\nrecognition of the way things really are.\nThis is important because you can have the connate ignorance remain in tact without the presence of the\nimputing ignorance.\nThis separation is not even apparent through the stilling of imputation like in śamatha. But it can be made\nreadily apparent in instances where you awaken from sleep, perhaps in a strange location, on vacation\netc., or even just awakening from a deep sleep. There can be a period of moments where you do not\nrealize where you are right yet, and then suddenly it all comes back, where you are, what you have\nplanned for the day, where you need to be, etc.,\nIn those initial moments you are still conscious and perceiving appearances, and there is still an innate\nexperience of the room being external and objects being something over-there, separate from oneself.\nThat is because this fundamental error in recognition of the nature of phenomena is a deep conditioning\nthat creates the artificial bifurcation of inner and outer experiential dimensions, even without the activity\nof imputation.” - Kyle Dixon, 2019\nLopon Malcolm:\n“In the basis (Tibetan: གཞ,ི Wylie: gzhi) there were neutral awarenesses (sh shes pa lung ma bstan) that did\nnot recognize themselves. (Dzogchen texts actually do not distinguish whether this neutral awareness is\none or multiple.) This non-recognition was the innate ignorance. Due to traces of action and affliction\nfrom a previous universe, the basis became stirred and the Five Pure Lights shone out. When a neutral\nawareness recognized the lights as its own display, that was Samantabhadra (immediate liberation\nwithout the performance of virtue). Other neutral awarenesses did not recognize the lights as their own\ndisplay, and thus imputed “other” onto the lights. This imputation of “self” and “other” was the imputing\nignorance. This ignorance started sentient beings and samsara (even without non-virtue having been\n935\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\ncommitted). Yet everything is illusory, since the basis never displays as anything other than the five\nlights.”\nStaying near Sāvatthī … “Monks, I will describe & analyze dependent co-arising for you.

It is a direct insight into how ignorance and karmic\npropensities are exerted into our reified samsaric world of solid self, body-mind and universe with its\nincumbent clinging and sufferings in real time. And as you might know, a central teaching of Buddha in the\nPali canon is the four noble truths, pertaining to suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering\nand the path that ends suffering (ref: https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN56_11.html). The\nafflictive chain of the twelve links of dependent origination can only cease upon the cessation of ignorance\nvia the unfolding of wisdom through development of insight, therefore merely suppressing one’s suffering\nor even entering a temporary state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi or even Nirodha Samapatti is not going to reverse\nthe chain of afflictive dependent origination. Reversing the chain of twelve links requires analytical\ncessation, not merely non-analytical cessation (see: two cessations), otherwise the chain of dependent\narising driven by ignorance cannot be put to an end.\nAfflictive dependent origination/the twelve links pertains to the origin of suffering. Everything perceivable\nand experience-able are conditionally arisen in dependence on causes and conditions, with the exception\nof the two cessations (analytical and non-analytical) and unconditioned space*. Nirvana (cessation;\nspecifically analytical cessation) is obviously not conditioned by causes and conditions and hence called\nasaṃskṛta (not-conditioned), however, according to Madhyamaka even the two cessations (analytical and\n937\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nnon-analytical) and unconditioned space are empty and dependent - although not dependent on causes\nand conditions, they are dependently designated, and hence are empty of inherent existence.\n“There are two kinds of space discussed in Buddhist texts. The first and most important is space as \"absence of\nobstruction.\" This is uncompounded or unconditioned space. The second kind of space is dimension, such as the\ndimension of the cavity in a cup. That kind of space is compounded.\nThe other two unconditioned dharmas, the two cessations, also lack inherent existence because they are the\nabsence of causes, and do not by themselves exist.” - Lopon Malcolm\nIn the suttas (scriptures) and traditional Buddhism, there is both the three lifetimes model of the twelve\nlinks, where afflictive dependent origination plays out through past (first two links), present (next eight links)\nand future (last two links) lifetimes, as well as the one-lifetime model where all twelve links are exerted in\none life or in each moment of afflicted experience. While this guide focuses on the dependent origination\nthat can be experienced in this very lifetime, it should also be mentioned that the Buddha clearly did have\nthe three lives in mind as evinced when he talked about gandhabba (rebirth-linking consciousness)\ndescending into the mother’s womb as part of the process of the twelve links (DN 15: Mahā Nidāna Sutta -\nread this to have a thorough and clear analysis by Buddha on the twelve links of dependent origination),\nand it is taught that it is the rebirth-linking consciousness which contributes to the birth and development\nof the fetus’s body (and the goal of his teachings is to put an end to suffering and the uncontrolled cycle of\nrebirth - the Mahayana Buddhists hold the higher goal of Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings\nrather than the cessation of arahants of early Buddhism, but that is another topic of discussion) and the\nrest of the chain of dependent origination, thus the twelve links of dependent origination is not merely\npsychological in the context of the Buddhadharma (teachings of Buddha). However going into the details\nof this, along with the topic of rebirth is beyond the scope of this guide. Suffice to say, both the three and\none lifetime model of the twelve links of dependent origination are seen to be valid in the teachings of\nBuddhadharma. The process of rebirth does not require a soul, a self or a Self, but is explained as a causal\nprocess of dependent origination - more details in\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/reincarnation-without-soul.html\nThe doctrine of rebirth is intrinsically tied to the three-lives model of the twelve links of dependent\norigination. Even if you don’t believe in rebirth or reincarnation, it is doubtless that the Buddha clearly had\nliteral rebirth (i.e. rebirth/afterlife in the literal and not merely metaphorical or psychological sense) in mind\nwhen describing the twelve links of dependent origination, plus it is irrefutable that he had discussed about\nrebirth and his countless past lives in more than numerous occasions. It is important to understand this to\nsee the context in which the twelve links of dependent origination and the so called ‘death-free’ and ‘not-\nconditioned’ nature of Nirvana is taught, otherwise it will be misunderstood. If you have read the suttas\nand Pāli Canon, you will see that the Buddha does not hold any sort of view of an Essence and only taught\nabout process and dependent origination, that is to say, suffering, the origin of suffering, the end of\nsuffering and the path that ends suffering. He has never taught about an I, me and mine, or an ultimate\n938\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nsource and substratum, in fact he rejected all these views such as in (MN 1 - The Root Sequence,\nMūlapariyāya Sutta - read this one if you have not, including the commentary by Ven. Thanissaro at the top\nof the page). The whole process of birth and death is simply the chain of dependent origination in action\nand the reversal or cessation of rebirth (becoming, birth and death) is likewise through the cessation of the\nafflictive chain of dependent origination with the cessation of ignorance, and so on. Death-free simply\nmeans the end of birth, ageing, sickness and death, which precisely and merely means the end of rebirth,\nit does not require or posit some “deathless ground” that remains after cessation. Because most people do\nnot understand essencelessness, they wrongly grasp on the wrong translation of the epithet of\nnibbana/nirvana (which literally means cessation or extinguishment, a big hint there already) - amata\n(death-free) and turn it into an apophatic absolute “THE Deathless” and thereby distort Buddhism into a\ndoctrine of their own making that is no different from Advaita Vedanta.\nFurthermore, not only did the Buddha recalled his past lives, but so did many of his students, and even\ntoday there are many seasoned practitioners and meditators that recalled their past lives, including John\nTan, Sim Pern Chong and many others. There are also many interesting researches and findings that\nvalidates rebirth, including Dr. Ian Stevenson’s research into the past life memories of children. Whether\nyou treat these findings, experiences and memories as valid and regardless of your belief/lack-thereof in\nrebirth or reincarnation, it is doubtless that rebirth and ending rebirth in the literal sense is a major theme\nof Buddha’s teachings, and the secular version of Buddhism devoid of literal rebirth is a rather modern\noffshoot or development where modern materialists try to sell their version of Buddhism stripped of its\nspiritual contents and only go for the tangible benefits of practice to be experienced in this life only. From\nthe perspective of traditional Buddhism, it is as Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith said, “Dharma\nsets out to solve one existential problem and one only: rebirth in samsara due to afflictions. If you are\npracticing ethics, meditation, etc. with any view in mind other than ceasing to take rebirth in samsara, you\nmay be engaged in this or that practice, but you are not practicing Dharma. As Mañjuśrī said, \"If one has\nclinging to this life, one is not a Dharma person.\"”\nI am not saying that the secular approach is completely devoid of merits (you can certainly benefit from the\npractice in various ways even if you do not accept rebirth, although perhaps to a different extent than\nsomeone who wholeheartedly accepts, investigates and practices Buddhadharma in its entirety), and it is\nnot the purpose of this guide here to convince you of rebirth (although it certainly helps to be more open\nminded when it comes to exploring spirituality). But as I mentioned, in order to even understand what the\nBuddha was teaching in the first place, it is important to understand the context in which the twelve links\nof dependent origination, as well as the death-free nirvana (cessation) is taught. Why is this so? In the\ncontext of one-life dependent origination, ‘death-free’ does not make sense, as even an arahant’s body is\nsubjected to ageing, sickness and death (sometimes in gruesome and unpleasant ways - such as\nMogallana’s death), and although a living arahant has ended passion, aggression and delusion, and ended\nall identifications and the conceit of ‘I Am’ or any traces of self-identity, their five senses remain unimpaired\nand still experience pleasure and pain*. However, this all makes sense in a three-lifetime model - because\nthere is no more birth in a future life, there is henceforth no more future ageing, sickness and death of a\n939\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nfuture lifetime, and hence death-free is spoken in that context (absolutely not in the sense of an unchanging\nmetaphysical substrate).\n(*'Monks, there are these two forms of the nibbāna property. Which two? The nibbāna property with fuel\nremaining, and the nibbāna property with no fuel remaining.\n'And what is the nibbāna property with fuel remaining? There is the case where a monk is an arahant whose\neffluents have ended, who has attained completion, finished the task, laid down the burden, attained the true\ngoal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis. His five [sense] faculties still remain\nand, owing to their being intact, he experiences the pleasing & the displeasing, and is sensitive to pleasure & pain.\nHis ending of passion, aversion, & delusion is termed the nibbāna property with fuel remaining.\n'And what is the nibbāna property with no fuel remaining? There is the case where a monk is an arahant... released\nthrough right gnosis. For him, all that is sensed, being unrelished, will grow cold right here. This is termed the\nnibbāna property with no fuel remaining.'\n— Iti 44)\nAnswering someone’s question on whether the term ‘dukkha’ and the twelve links only relate to mentally\nfabricated experience in a state of delusion, Soh replied:\n\"Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, death is dukkha; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, & despair are dukkha;\nassociation with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; not getting what is wanted\nis dukkha. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.\"\n— SN 56.11\nIn the Mahā Puama Sutta (M 109 = S 22.82), we find the Buddha questioned by an\nunnamed certain monk on this point, and the Buddha answers, thus:\n“Bhante, is that clinging the same as the 5 aggregates of clinging, or is it different from the 5\naggregates of clinging?”35\n“Bhikshu, that clinging is neither the same as these 5 aggregates of clinging, nor is it different\nfrom the 5 aggregates of clinging. It is the desire and lust36 for the 5 aggregates of clinging that is\nthe clinging there.3\nAppropriated Aggregates are Suffering\nA common misunderstanding is that Buddha taught \"life is suffering\". As Alan Smith pointed out, there is\noften an overemphasis on suffering, but actually in Buddhism, there is only suffering when there is\nappropriation and clinging. To be clear: Buddha has never said \"life is suffering\", however, he did teach\nright from the beginning in his first discourse on the four noble truths that \"appropriated aggregates are\nsuffering\", and by appropriated I mean tainted with I-making and mine-making.\nIn the Pali suttas, clinging and appropriation are not equated with the sheer aggregates\n940\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n( https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN44.html ), and as Stian mentioned, he thinks aggregates\nare almost never mentioned in the sense of 'sheer aggregates' in the Pali canon. I think you get glimpses\nof how are 'sheer aggregates experienced by Buddha/arahants' in scriptures like Bahiya Sutta and Kalaka\nSutta. In any case, the appropriation is what causes suffering, and the end of appropriation is the end of\nsuffering.\nIn Bahiya Sutta ( https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html ),\nthe end of appropriation is equated to the end of suffering, and it is the definition of Nirvana\n( https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2012/09/great-resource-of-buddha-teachings.html ). The first\ndiscourse he taught was on the four noble truths and one of his five students attained stream entry then,\nand the second discourse ( https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-anatta-lakkhana-\nsutta.html ) he taught was on anatta and all the five monks became arahants.\nNow when we come to the Mahayana teachings, all aggregates are taught to be primordially pure and\nluminous. Does this negate the Pali suttas which says appropriated aggregates are suffering? No, it does\nnot, if understood correctly in context.\nHere's some nice clarifications on Dhammawheel:\nhttps://dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?t=28932\n\"\nSobhana wrote:\nThe Buddha sums up his definition of dukkha with: \"aggregates subject to clinging are suffering\" (pancu-\npadanakkhandha).\nWhat is the meaning and what are the implications?\"\n\"Since \"upadana\" means \"appropriation\",\n(see http://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5560 )\nmore accurate translation would be \"appropriated aggregates are suffering\". This implies that suffering\ncontinues as long as the aggregates are appropriated, identified with.\nBest wishes!\nPost by vinasp » Wed Feb 22, 2017 8:10 am\nHi everyone,\nI intend to quote some discourses which speak of the cessation of the clinging aggregates, using the\nalternative term 'sakkaya.'\nOne problem with this term is that every translator seems to use a different word for it.\nBhikkhu Bodhi uses 'identity', Ven.

All three continue in this way:\n\"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion\ntowards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards\nconsciousness. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion his mind is\nliberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is\nbirth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of\nbeing.’”\nClearly, the aggregates mentioned at the start are those of an unliberated individual.\nAnother possibility is that 'form is suffering', and the rest, are not meant to be understood as ontological\nstatements, but as how these things should be regarded. This explains 'seeing thus' as what leads to\nliberation.\nActual form is experienced, but the 'form aggregate' may mean a habit of regarding form in the wrong\nway, as permanent, a source of pleasure, and in relation to a self. If so, then the form aggregate will\nvanish when seen in the right way.\nIt seems that the discourses do not always make an explicit distinction between the aggregates and the\nclinging aggregates.\nVen. Bhikkhu Bodhi, while not entirely rejecting the distinction, follows the Abhidhamma and\nCommentaries, arguing that the Arahant is still described by clinging aggregates.\nPerhaps we should assume that almost all teaching on the aggregates is about the five clinging\n943\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\naggregates.\nRegards, Vincent.\n….\nA.

If cold is just cold, the cold\nkills you, and the whole universe is cold. (See: Where There Is No Cold or Heat) In such a state, you are\ncompletely 'killed'. It is as if, and in fact in an experiential sense it is absolutely true, 'you' no longer exist\nat all. There is no trace of 'you' left anywhere in the universe. It is such a state of equipoise accompanied\nwith prajna wisdom that liberates. And how can there be incompleteness, imperfection, or feeling of lack\nin such a state? How can there be mental unease, resistance, or craving in such a state, whether you are\nsitting on a porch in front of a beach, a mountain, or a slum?\nBitten by mosquitoes is just another sensation - in sensing only sensation, no sensor. Sensations are\njust sensations, they kill 'you' (and in fact after anatta is realised as always already so and becomes stable\nnatural state then there is no longer even a 'killing you' it's just naturally so as an actualized state). The\nsensations don't bother you at all, it is more like you bother the sensation, or rather the sense of 'self' is\nin fact the karmic activity of resisting that sensation. It's like someone can be very annoyed at some\nsounds, and another person just sits there in a state of zen and equanimity, why? The sounds in and of\nitself doesn't bother the person, it's the person 'bothering the sound'. The Buddha said, the eyes and\nforms, body and sensations, and so on, doesn't fetter you, it is the desire [or\n945\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nresistance/aversion/delusion] towards them that constitutes the fetter. Fetter or afflictions is simply 'self-\ncreated' chains and bondage, the aggregates are in and of themselves free when seen as they are.\n(Update: and when I said self-created I don't mean arising from a truly existing agent as there isn't any,\nbut rather arising due to the nexus of ignorance-driven dependent origination)\n·\nReply\n· 8m\n·\nEdited\nBodhidharma says, \"The usual person, through basic ignorance, fixates on one thing and then\nanother.\"\nThis basic ignorance is the root of self-image, avidya, basic ignorance, ignoring the fact that one is\nalready fundamentally free and pretending to be bound. In the midst of space, trying to carve out some\nterritory, as if one could build walls out of the sheer air, as if one could tie knots in the air, nail clouds in\nplace.\nThis tying of knots, this erecting of walls, this nailing things down, is this fixating on one thing and then\nanother, grasping at thought, grasping at sounds and feelings, grasping at forms, and names. This is\ncalled craving.\nAnd so the craving that we need to address in our practice is not just a matter of giving up our\nattachment to fashion or a beautiful house, a beautiful wife, a beautiful husband, beautiful children, a\nbeautiful life in which there are no problems. Dropping that does not liberate, because all craving, all\ngreed, all lust, all anger, are rooted in this fundamental strategy of self-image to contract and localize, to\ncreate boundaries within emptiness, to grasp at emptiness. And so we must understand this process of\nfixation as it arises, and it arises not in a beautiful house. It arises in this moment of seeing and hearing. It\narises as mind moments display themselves, and as this display is interpreted to be self and other, time\nand space, body and mind. This is the craving that we must understand and release.\n- Anzan Hoshin Roshi\nSN 35.28\n946\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nPTS: S iv 19\nCDB ii 1143\nAdittapariyaya Sutta: The Fire Sermon\ntranslated from the Pali by\nThanissaro Bhikkhu\n© 1993\nAlternate translation: Ñanamoli\nAlternate format: [SuttaReadings.net icon]\nX\nThe updated version is freely available at\nThis version of the text might be out of date.

There he addressed the monks:\n\"Monks, the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. Forms are aflame. Consciousness at the\neye is aflame. Contact at the eye is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at\nthe eye — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is aflame. Aflame with\nwhat? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with\nbirth, aging & death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs.\n\"The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame...\n\"The nose is aflame. Aromas are aflame...\n\"The tongue is aflame. Flavors are aflame...\n\"The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame...\n\"The intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame.

Aflame with what?\nAflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I say, with birth, aging &\ndeath, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs.\n\"Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye,\ndisenchanted with forms, disenchanted with consciousness at the eye, disenchanted with contact at the\neye. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye, experienced as pleasure, pain\nor neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that, too, he grows disenchanted.\n\"He grows disenchanted with the ear...\n\"He grows disenchanted with the nose...\n\"He grows disenchanted with the tongue...\n\"He grows disenchanted with the body...\n\"He grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with consciousness\nat the intellect, disenchanted with contact at the intellect. And whatever there is that arises in\ndependence on contact at the intellect, experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He\ngrows disenchanted with that too. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is\nfully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended,\nthe holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'\"\nThat is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words. And while this\nexplanation was being given, the hearts of the 1,000 monks, through no clinging (not being sustained),\nwere fully released from fermentation/effluents.\"\nIn Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, we say the five aggregates reveal themselves to be the five wisdom\nBuddhas, they are the radiance of Buddha-nature (empty-clarity) itself. You should be becoming clear about\nthis point by now, experientially. Aggregates do not cease after anatta, rather they are experienced as\nBuddha-nature in its primordial purity and perfection.”\n“Buddhism is nothing but replacing the 'Self' in Hinduism with Condition Arising. Keep the clarity, the\npresence, the luminosity and eliminate the ultimate 'Self', the controller, the supreme. Still you must taste,\nsense, eat, hear and see Pure Awareness in every authentication. And every authentication is Bliss.” - John\nTan, 2004\n“Understand immense intelligence not as if someone is there to act and direct, rather as total exertion of\nthe universe to make this moment possible; then all appearances are miraculous and marvelous.” - John\n948\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nTan, 2012\n“The Pristine awareness is often mistaken as the 'Self'. It is especially difficult for one that has intuitively\nexperience the 'Self' to accept 'No-Self'. As I have told you many times that there will come a time when you\nwill intuitively perceive the 'I' -- the pure sense of Existence but you must be strong enough to go beyond\nthis experience until the true meaning of Emptiness becomes clear and thorough. The Pristine Awareness\nis the so-called True-Self' but why we do not call it a 'Self' and why Buddhism has placed so much emphasis\non the Emptiness nature? This then is the true essence of Buddhism. It is needless to stress anything about\n'Self' in Buddhism; there are enough of 'Logies' of the 'I\" in Indian Philosophies. If one wants to know about\nthe experience of 'I AM', go for the Vedas and Bhagavad Gita. We will not know what Buddha truly taught\n2500 years ago if we buried ourselves in words. Have no doubt that The Dharma Seal is authentic and not\nto be confused.\nWhen you have experienced the 'Self' and know that its nature is empty, you will know why to include this\nidea of a 'Self' into Buddha-Nature is truly unnecessary and meaningless. True Buddhism is not about\neliminating the 'small Self' but cleansing this so called 'True Self' (Atman) with the wisdom of Emptiness.” -\nJohn Tan, 2005\n\"What you are suggesting is already found in Samkhya system. I.e. the twenty four tattvas are not the self\naka purusha. Since this system was well known to the Buddha, if that's all his insight was, then his insight\nis pretty trivial. But Buddha's teachings were novel. Why where they novel? They were novel in the fifth\ncentury BCE because of his teaching of dependent origination and emptiness. The refutation of an ultimate\nself is just collateral damage.\" - Lopon Malcolm\nIn January 2005, John Tan wrote:\n“[19:21] <^john^> learn how to experience emptiness and no-selfness. :)\n[19:22] <^john^> this is the only way to liberate.\n[19:22] <^john^> not to dwell too deeply into the minor aspect of pure awareness.\n[19:23] <^john^> of late i have been seeing songs and poems relating to the luminosity aspect of Pure\nAwareness.\n[19:23] <^john^> uncreated, original, mirror bright, not lost in nirvana and samsara..etc\n[19:23] <^john^> what use is there?\n[19:24] <ZeN`n1th> oic...\n[19:24] <^john^> we have from the very beginning so and yet lost for countless aeons of lives.\n[19:25] <^john^> buddha did not come to tell only about the luminosity aspect of pure awareness.\n[19:25] <^john^> this has already been expressed in vedas.\n[19:25] <^john^> but it becomes Self.\n[19:25] <^john^> the ultimate controller\n949\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[19:26] <^john^> the deathless\n[19:26] <^john^> the supreme.. etc\n[19:26] <^john^> this is the problem.\n[19:26] <^john^> this is not the ultimate nature of Pure Awareness.\n[19:27] <^john^> for full enlightenment to take place, experience the clarity and emptiness.

I have a strong Taoist background and passion for Hinduism when\nI was young. So philosophically and culturally, essencelessness is not a view that suits me. But it takes\npainful experiences to come to a willingness to let go, to see the truth of impermanence and anatta. To\nchallenge and come to an understanding that you don't actually have to do this and that.... (or have an)\nultimate here and there to release. But rather to truly accept and look deeply into impermanence, then you\nwill let go and we can come to a new understanding of the relationship of suffering and the truth of\nsuffering having to do with a fundamental paradigm we hold so dearly.\n..Your mindset and experience can change, so is your understanding, and you just begin a new path with\nnew understanding. Impermanence from personal, micro and macro view. You see when you see\nimpermanence and use it as a door in practice, your view changes also, from Vipassana observing the\nminutest sensations in our bodily sensations to appreciating a view in current quantum physics, macro\nview, to observe events. So our idea changes and we adopt such understanding in our life over time.\nSometimes it really depends and it needs the right condition and situation to trigger it, just like the case of\n951\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nfinancial crisis.” - John Tan, 2015, What is an Authentic Buddhist Teaching?,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2016/07/what-is-authentic-buddhist-teaching.html\nYou can also see that whenever the Buddha taught about ‘not-conditioned’ or ‘death-free’, it is always about\nthe release and elimination of the afflictive conditions driving rebirth and suffering, and not the positing of\nsome kind of eternal ground ala Advaita Vedanta:\nBuddha said in Dhātuvibhanga Sutta: The Exposition of the Elements\nhttps://www.wisdompubs.org/book/middle-length-discourses-buddha/selections/middle-length-\ndiscourses-140-dhatuvibhanga-sutta\n28. “Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced covetousness, desire, and lust; now he has abandoned\nthem, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer\nsubject to future arising. Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced anger, ill will, and hate; now he has\nabandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are\nno longer subject to future arising. Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced ignorance and delusion; now\nhe has abandoned them, cut them off [246] at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so\nthat they are no longer subject to future arising. Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this peace] possesses the\nsupreme foundation of peace. For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble peace, namely, the pacification of lust, hate,\nand delusion.\n29. “So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not neglect wisdom, should preserve truth,\nshould cultivate relinquishment, and should train for peace.’\n30. “‘The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations], and when the tides\nof conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.’ So it was said. And with reference to what\nwas this said?\n31. “Bhikkhu, ‘I am’ is a conceiving; ‘I am this’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall not be’ is a\nconceiving; ‘I shall be possessed of form’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be formless’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be percipient’\nis a conceiving; ‘I shall be non-percipient’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’ is a\nconceiving. Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a tumour, conceiving is a dart. By overcoming all conceivings,\nbhikkhu, one is called a sage at peace. And the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die; he\nis not shaken and is not agitated. For there is nothing present in him by which he might be born. Not\nbeing born, how could he age? Not ageing, how could he die? Not dying, how could he be shaken? Not\nbeing shaken, why should he be agitated?\n32. “So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands\nupon these [foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.’\nBhikkhu, bear in mind this brief exposition of the six elements.”\n952\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nI have written a very long article that talks about what Nibbana/Nirvana (cessation/extinguishment) means\nin Buddhadharma here: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/01/the-deathless-in-\nbuddhadharma.html\nAlso see: [insight] [buddhism] A reconsideration of the meaning of \"Stream-Entry\" considering the data\npoints of both pragmatic Dharma and traditional Buddhism\nA few excerpts from the link:\n“Hi Justin Struble, we have to be very careful in interpreting that Nibbana sutta. First of all we have to understand\nwhat 'Nirvana/Nibbana' means in context. As Ven Hui-feng puts it, \"keep in mind the basic metaphorical meaning\nof the term nirvana, the extinguishing of a flame\". The main analogy given by Buddha for nirvana is the\nextinguishing of a flame. As Ven Nanananda also pointed out,\n\"Regarding this concept of Nibbàna too, the worldling is generally tempted to entertain some kind of\nma¤¤anà, or me-thinking. Even some philosophers are prone to that habit. They indulge in some sort of prolific\nconceptualisation and me-thinking on the basis of such conventional usages as `in Nib bàna', `from Nibbàna',\n`on reaching Nibbàna' and `my Nib bàna'. By hypostasizing Nibbàna they de velop a substance view, even of\nthis concept, just as in the case of pañhavi, or earth. Let us now try to determine whether this is justifi able.\nThe primary sense of the word Nibbàna is `extinction', or `extin guishment'. We have already discussed\nthis point with reference to such contexts as Aggivacchagottasutta.[8] In that dis course the Bud dha explained\nthe term Nibbàna to the wan dering ascetic Vaccha got ta with the help of a simile of the ex tinction of a fire.\nSimply be cause a fire is said to go out, one should not try to trace it, wondering where it has gone. The term\nNibbàna is essentially a verbal noun. We also came across the phrase nibbuto tveva saïkhaü gacchati, \"it is\nreck oned as `extinguished'\".[9]\"\nExtinction of what? Extinction of passion, aggression and delusion driving the whole mass of samsara.\nExtinction of the the whole mass of suffering/samsara in the twelve links from ignorance up to old age, sickness\nand death.\nNext is the terms 'unconditioned/death-free/etc' it is very easy to reify this in terms of a metaphysical entity.\nThis is not the case.\nHere are some quotations which should hopefully clarify:\nNana/Geoff: \"“Firstly, while the translation of asaṃskṛta as “the unconditioned” is fairly common, it’s a\nrather poor translation that all too easily leads to reification. The term asaṃskṛta refers to a negation of\nconditioned factors, and the meaning is better conveyed by “not-conditioned.” Secondly, for Sautrāntika\ncommentators, and many mahāyānika commentators as well, an analytical cessation (pratisaṃkhyānirodha) is\n953\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\na non-implicative negation (prasajyapratiṣedha), i.e. a negation that doesn’t imply the presence of some other\nentity, and therefore nirvāṇa simply refers to a cessation that terminates the defilements and fetters that are\nabandoned by the correct practice of the noble path. It doesn’t refer to an entity or state that is substantially\nexistent (dravyasat).” \"\nNana/Geoff: \"One has to be careful with such descriptions which may seem to be pointing to some sort of\ntruly existent \"unconditioned ground.\" Nibbāna is the extinguishment of the mental outflows (āsavā). The\nliberated mind is measureless (appamāṇa). This is not a \"state of oneness with all of existence.\" It's an absence of\nidentification (anattatā). It's non-indicative (anidassana), unestablished (appatiṭṭha), and not-dependent\n(anissita). None of these adjectives entail any sort of metaphysical \"ground of being\" or \"unconditioned absolute.\"\nThey are all negations. An arahant has simply \"gone out.\"\ntiltbillings: \"There is no \"deathless.\" That is a bad translation leading to an objectification/reification of the\nidea of awakening. With awakening, there is no more rebirth, one is free from death.

Nirvana is extinction, like the\nblowing out of a flame, it is simply and merely the end of suffering and afflictions and does not imply a\nmetaphysical substantial existent as some may postulate. There is no \"The Unconditioned\" or \"The Unborn\" or\n\"The Deathless\" as some sort of metaphysical essence. There is an unconditioned dharma - analytical cessation\n(nirvana) - that is the end of birth and death (death-free), is not conditioned (by afflictive causes and\nmanifestations) etc.\nAll these are classic Nirvana stuff found in the earliest teachings in Pali suttas. In Mahayana emptiness,\nthere is another understanding of \"unconditioned\" and that is as what Kyle said which I find to be very well said:\n\"The unconditioned is the emptiness of the skandhas.\nRecognition of the emptiness of the skandhas means that the skandhas are non-arisen, what has not\narisen cannot be conditioned.\"\n\"The basis should be understood to be in accordance with the following insight from Nāgārjuna:\n• Since arising, abiding and perishing are not established,\nthe conditioned is not established;\nsince the conditioned is never established,\nhow can the unconditioned be established?\nand,\n• Outside of the saṃskṛtas [conditioned dharmas], there are no asaṃskṛta [unconditioned dharmas], and the\ntrue nature [bhūtalakṣaṇa] of the saṃskṛta is exactly asaṃskṛta. The saṃskṛtas being empty, etc. the asaṃskṛtas\nthemselves are also empty, for the two things are not different. Besides, some people, hearing about the defects\nof the saṃskṛtadharmas, become attached [abhiniveśante] to the asaṃskṛtadharmas and, as a result of this\nattachment, develop fetters.\nThe latter portion of the second quotation addresses your issue.\" - Kyle Dixon\nIn any case, whether the classical nirvana understanding of the earliest text, or the emptiness\nunderstanding of unconditioned/non-arisen, there is no postulating of a truly existing metaphysical essence.” -\nSoh, 2014\nAlso, in the Mahayana teachings, the not-conditioned is simply the emptiness and non-arising of the\nconditioned,\n“For example the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra states:\n957\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nOutside of the saṃskṛtas [conditioned dharmas], there are no asaṃskṛta [unconditioned dharmas], and the true\nnature [bhūtalakṣaṇa] of the saṃskṛta is exactly asaṃskṛta.

Besides, some people, hearing about the defects\nof the saṃskṛtadharmas, become attached [abhiniveśante] to the asaṃskṛtadharmas and, as a result of this\nattachment, develop fetters.\nNāgārjuna communicates the same thing here:\nSince arising, abiding and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established; since the conditioned\nis never established, how can the unconditioned be established?” - Kyle Dixon, 2019\n\"Samsara is not even slightly differentiable from nirvana; nirvana is not even slightly differentiable from\nsamsara; whatever is the limit of nirvana, that is the limit of samsara; whatever is the limit of samsara,\nthat is the limit of nirvana— there isn't even the subtlest distinction between those two.\"\n-- Nāgārjuna\n\"That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of being born and passing on, is, taken non-\ncausally and beyond all dependence, declared to be nirvāna.\" ~ MMK XXV 9, translation by Sprung\nNirvana is samsara rightly seen, it is not something apart from samsara.\nIt is a very common misinterpretation among Hindus but also many Buddhists, that the ‘death-free’ (amata)\nof Nibbana/Nirvana is referring to a deathless Self or unconditioned ground, substrate, substratum,\nsubstance, etc. This is not just the view/misinterpretation among Advaita Vedantins, and not just among\ncertain Vajrayana and Mahayana Buddhists, but even the Theravadins (especially the Thai Forest Traditions\n- though there are exceptions) can be prone to misinterpreting Nibbana/Nirvana in terms of the extreme\nof eternalism. Their much prized Poo Roo (Knower) and changeless Citta (Mind) is none other than the I AM\nor Eternal Witness. I have just watched a video where a famous Thai Forest monk described the unborn,\nuncreated reality as one’s Consciousness in contrast to the transient and passing conditioned states of\nexperiences. This kind of view is common among the Thai Forest teachings. Ajahn Brahmavamso, one of\nthe well known monks in the Thai forest tradition, criticized such a view and said that (not in these exact\nwords) many of those Thai forest monks, even those of high status, fail to understand Buddhadharma and\nare holding views no different from Hindus by reifying and clinging to the Poo Roo (“The One Who Knows”).\nI agree.\nThe tendency to deviate from the Buddhadharma and fall into the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism\nruns rampant in all the current traditions of Buddhism, be it Theravada, or Mahayana, or Vajrayana. It is\nquite disappointing sometimes when I look through the bookshelves on Buddhism, as I always find that\nthere are very, very few clear-eyed authors and teachers. Now, if I am reading a Hindu or Advaita book, I\nwill not have thoughts of disappointment since they are accurately portraying the views of Adi Shankara,\nand it is all good with me. I do appreciate Advaita Vedanta and continue to recommend Advaita books to\nthose pursuing the path of self-realization, and books like those of Ramana Maharshi have been very\n958\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nhelpful for the earlier period of my practice. But to present the views and realizations of Advaita as if they\nare the views and realization of Buddha? I think this does not do justice to the Buddha and his teachings,\nand if Buddha were to be around, he would have forcefully reprimanded these people with very strong\nwords like how he verbally reprimanded and trashed his monk Bhikkhu Sati. In the absence of Buddha, we\nneed more people to do his work of ‘reprimanding these people (that misrepresents him)’ by openly\ncriticizing such views (both eternalism and nihilism) without reservation. It is necessary for the continued\nflourishing and non-degeneration of Buddhadharma.\n禅宗有个公案，僧问大同曰：“天上天下唯我独尊，如何是我？”，大曰：“推倒老师有什么过？”健曰：“往往有等\n禅师，示人：‘高高山上立，深深海底行。’皆欲以这天上天下之神我，害尽天下苍生。一般瞎汉，死死执着这\n个，最难出也；打倒不惟无过也，且救他慧命，是释迦真儿孙。”\nTranslation: Ch'an school has a koan, monk asks Da Tong, \"Throughout heaven and earth only I AM the world\nhonoured one, what is this Self?\" Da answers, \"any faults for pushing down the teacher?\" Jian says, \"often there\nare Ch'an teachers, teaching people, 'We should stand atop the highest mountain, walk the floor of the deepest\nocean’\". With this God-Self of the Universe (Atman-Brahman), [one] causes harm to the common people. The\ncommoners stubbornly cling to this, and it is most difficult to come out of it, [thus] not only is there no faults in\npushing down [such a teacher], one furthermore saves the person's wisdom-life, and is a true child of Shakya.\nIt does not mean literally or physically pushing the teacher down, it just means refuting them strongly when\nnecessary in order that others do not be misled by such teachers.\n⁠\nOf course, criticizing faulty teachings and views should be done moderately, respectfully and\nappropriately (not for the purpose of creating confrontations with the students of other teachers - what a\nwaste of precious practice time!), and we should know that there are wisdom and lessons that are\nvaluable from the sharing of any genuine practitioners and teachers regardless of their depth of\nrealization. Convincing others only work if they have faith in Buddha to begin with or they seem very open\nminded to investigate and question their own views and paradigm. Open mindedness is key, and\nconditions are vital - as John Tan said, even the Buddha cannot save someone who does not have yuan\n(conditions) （佛不度无缘之人）, and as John told me, he only speaks when he discerns the conditions are\nthere for genuine communication, and whoever he speaks to about the dharma have come to direct\nrealization very quickly (it’s true). Conditions and timing are vital and John Tan seems to be always\nsensitive and deeply aware of the precise conditions and timing, there are times where John Tan told me\nto quickly and immediately reply with a certain message to someone because the precise condition and\ntiming is ripe for an opening for that particular person, and after I came back from the toilet he told me I\nmissed the timing and the conditions were gone.\n959\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWithout proper conditions, conversations might just end up in endless repetitive arguments and echo\nchambers with each camp repeating their own views (I have done plenty of useless online debating 10+\nyears ago).\nAs John Tan said in 2007,\n“(2:31 PM) Thusness: yamizi meeting your X right?

I also liked\nyour remarks, later on, about the confusion between nonduality and passivity. Thanks for sharing.\nSoh replied: Yeah. Almost all neo-Advaitins with very very few exceptions (only one exception I can think\nof: Tony Parsons - https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/02/tony-parsons-no-union-container-\nor.html ) reify a universal awareness.\nAlso, all traditional Advaitins without exceptions (except perhaps people like Sri Atmananda although\nGreg Goode pointed out that he basically went against traditional scriptures in his final proclamations)\nreify universal awareness, since it is the key doctrine that defines their entire tradition - Brahman is the\nuniversal awareness and ultimate reality, one without a second. Disagreeing with this key tenet that\ndefines the entire tradition is likely to put you outside the tradition -- as we see happen in cases like\nBuddha and his disciples, and even modern Indians like U.G. and J. Krishnamurti who had an insight that\ndeconstructs Atman-Brahman. These people, understandably, became iconoclasts that broke off from\ntheir tradition, rejected the authority of all teachers in the whole of their Indian sub-continent, and\n960\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nrejected all scriptural authority. Because although they may have gone through the I AM phase (we know\nJ. Krishnamurti went through that), they later had a further realization which repudiates the Upanishads.\nWe also see that happen with Actual Freedom Richard.\nAs I wrote before in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/three-paradigms-with-nondual-\nluminosity.html\nIt is my experience that deeper insights into 3)\nof the non-essentialist or non-reductionist kind leads to deeper\nfreedoms and liberation.

As Greg Goode wrote before,\nGreg Goode: Oh,\nanother thing - Advaitins don't see (what we're calling)\nsusbstantialism or essentialism as a bad thing. For them, it is the only\nthing. Since Brahman = truth, being and freedom from suffering, it\nmakes no sense to be without it. One needs it even to deny it, is the\nthinking there. So even the standards of evaluation are different.

Only those who are non-dogmatic, curious, inquisitive, open to challenging their\nassumptions and views -- be they derived partly from their own contemplative realizations or from\ndoctrinal traditions, may come to appreciate a non-substantialist form of insight or realization.\nIt is only in Buddhism where we experientially deconstruct universal awareness in all traditions, be it\nTheravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana (although many adherents and teachers of these traditions\nthemselves fall into the trap of reifying a universal awareness).\nFreedom from the Four Extremes\nThe Buddha rejects the four extremes: existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, neither\nexistence nor non-existence, whether it be with regards to the world, or the self, or the Buddha/Tathagata.\nThis is through comprehending that the nature of mind/phenomena is to be empty of self, empty of\ninherent existence, and merely dependently originates.\n“Saṃyutta Nikāya 12\n961\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nConnected Discourses on Causation\n15. Kaccanagotta\nAt Savatthī. Then the Venerable Kaccanagotta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down\nto one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘right view, right view.’ In what way, venerable sir, is\nthere right view?”\n“This world, Kaccana, for the most part depends upon a duality—upon the notion of existence and the\nnotion of nonexistence. But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom,\nthere is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world. And for one who sees the cessation of the world\nas it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard to the world.\n“This world, Kaccana, is for the most part shackled by engagement, clinging, and adherence. But this one\nwith right view does not become engaged and cling through that engagement and clinging, mental\nstandpoint, adherence, underlying tendency; he does not take a stand about ‘my self.’ He has no perplexity\nor doubt that what arises is only suffering arising, what ceases is only suffering ceasing. His knowledge\nabout this is independent of others. It is in this way, Kaccana, that there is right view. “‘All exists’: Kaccana,\nthis is one extreme. ‘All does not exist’: this is the second extreme. Without veering towards either of these\nextremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With ignorance as condition, volitional\nformations come to be; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness…. Such is the origin of this\nwhole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes\ncessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness….\nSuch is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”“ -\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN12_15.html\n“...“What do you think, Anuradha, do you regard the Tathagata as in form?”—“No, venerable sir.”—“Do you\nregard the Tathagata as apart from form?”—“No, venerable sir.”—“Do you regard the Tathagata as in feeling?\nAs apart from feeling? As in perception? As apart from perception? As in volitional formations? As apart\nfrom volitional formations? As in consciousness?

When you look for thoughts, you cannot find anything.\nTherefore re-examine the idea of existing and non-existing, they do not apply.” - John Tan, 2019\n“No behind, presence as only form is anatta\nPresence-as-form is merely appearing, nothing there, that's emptiness (the nature of Presence)\n...\nNot only no who, but truly no it, no there, no here, no now, no when, no where, no arising, no ceasing, no\nabiding or place of abidance. Coming to rest in the nature of presence with no place to rest, whole field of\nspontaneous illusory display emerges as empty-clarity-bliss.\n...\nI really like a statement by Jang-gya, “appearance negates existence”\nIt starts with the very vivid \"Presence\" (or you can call it Awareness or Clarity) that is simply shining as the\nvery vividness of forms, sounds, thoughts, whatever appears, as the subject/object or perceiver/perceived\ndichotomy has collapsed into a non-conceptual experience of the vividness of whatever manifests with\nzero sense of distance. There is no more standalone Presence or Awareness or Clarity in anatta. The illusion\nof a background Self/Mind has been penetrated. Even so, the very empty nature of 'foreground Presence'\nmay not yet reveal itself initially.\nLet's say you're looking at the floor, or a table, or whatever it is. It seems very solid and real, but then upon\nsome investigation it's realised to be merely appearing without substance or essence, and that happens to\nbe the very nature of Presence -- vividly appearing according to conditions but completely empty of\nanything 'there', empty of an 'it-ness' or 'floor-ness' or any sort of substance. Basically it's sort of like\nsuddenly an apparent figure you've been looking at or talking to is suddenly realised to be literally a\nhologram. The very nature of Presence as merely appearing without substance basically negates the\nextreme of existence.\nFor me the nature of Presence reveals in a more experiential sort of examination rather than through\nanalytical reasonings. Like what Thusness wrote in his article\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html\n\"If we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it arise, what is ‘thought’ like. 'Thought'\nwill reveal its nature is empty -- vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very important not to infer,\nthink or conceptualise but feel with our entire being this ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It seems to\n963\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nreside 'somewhere' but there is no way to locate it. It is just an impression of somewhere \"there\" but never\n\"there\". Similarly “here-ness” and “now-ness” are merely impressions formed by sensations, aggregates of\ncauses and conditions, nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like ‘selfness’.\"\nThat said not everyone uses or likes the term \"Presence\". Tsongkhapa doesn't use that term. You can\nsubstitute that for other terms like \"dharma\" etc, it's just the empty and luminously clear nature of the\ndisplay.\nForeground emptying has this taste where appearance negates existence.” - Soh, 2018\n“You keep mistaking the two truths for principles, rather than what they are, that is, cognitions.\nThe terms \"emptiness,\" \"dependent designation,\" and \"middle way\" are synonyms. They refer to the\nsame thing. In other words, there is no sublime middle that can be peeled away from the two truths. The\ntwo truths are inseparable, this is why Dharmamitra, in his commentary on Haribhadra's Sphutartha\ncommentary on the Perfection of Wisdom states:\nCalled \"deep,\" because some people do not understand the inseparable two truths, and for them it becomes a\nplace of fear, its depth difficult to realize.\"\nIt is possible we are talking about the same thing, but thus far, I don't think so. Jayānanda states in his\ncommentary on Candra's Introduction to the Middle Way:\nThe middle way is understood as dependent origination, having abandoned grasping to permanence and\nannihilation.\nAnd:\nThe middle way is the path free from concepts of entities and nonentities.\nNāgārjuna again, in the Vigrahavyavartani:\nI pay homage the supreme peerless Buddha who taught\nemptiness, dependent origination, and the middle way to have one meaning.\nOr Buddhapalita:\n\"Having a view of existence or nonexistence with respect to entities results in many errors, therefore, \"entities\nlack inherent existence\" is seeing the truth, i.e., the middle way, and that is proof of the ultimate.\n964\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBhavaviveka states:\nWhatever is emptiness, that is designated in dependence. Because the convention of mundane and\ntranscendent is asserted, there is designation dependent on appropriation. That is the middle way, because the\nmiddle is free from the extremes arising and nonarising, existence and nonexistence...For the meditation of the\nmiddle way it is said that one does not conceive at all, \"The eye is an existent entity,\" \"The eye is not an existence\nentity,\" and so on. The Ārya Ratnakuta Sūtra states, \"Kāśyapa, \"Existence\" is one extreme; 'Nonexistence\" is the\nsecond extreme, whatever is between those extremes is without form and cannot be shown, is unimpeded,\nnonabiding, does not appear, is not perceptible, is not a place.\" Those are the proofs. \"Path\" is a convention for\n\"method of obtaining.\"” – Arcaya Malcolm, 2018, https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=30010\n+A and -A Emptiness (The Two Yogic Tastes of Emptiness)\n+A and -A originated from Diamond Sutra’s A is not A, therefore A is A.\n+A Emptiness is Total Exertion and Maha. -A Emptiness is the empty, non-arising and illusory nature of\npresencing appearance. Phase 6 is about replacing the whole view with Dependent Origination and\nEmptiness through direct realization, and +A and -A are the experiences from it. However, it is possible to\nhave glimpses of +A and -A and still lack definitive realization. For example, one may have taste of dream-\nlike nature from all appearances arising as one’s radiance, but it is still a glimpse or experience than the\nrealization of emptiness, which overturns the view of seeing phenomena in terms of existing by way of its\nown essence, arising, abiding and ceasing.\nIn phase 6, it is no longer about clarity (clarity is already implicit and forgotten rather than singled out or\nover-emphasized). It is possible to realize and experience +A without going into -A, or realize and experience\n-A without going into +A, and it is also possible to experience both and later come to an integration of +A\nand -A through an experiential realization. Total exertion too has various depths, at a mature phase the\ntotal exertion penetrates not only the ten directions but the three times (past, present and future).\n“…the conceptual notions of mind, appearances and external objects are all deconstructed. [But] It doesn't\nmean a blank nothing. Vivid Appearances will unfailingly manifest, that is what Mipham meant by\ncoalescence of appearance and emptiness… …I am referring to complete deconstruction into Primordial\nPurity as emptiness [-A].” – John Tan\n“To me, Gorampa and Mipham are more on exhaustion of the conventional into freedom from all\nelaborations. I classify it under the -A of emptiness in ATR context.\nTsongkhapa on the other hand embraced the conventional wholeheartedly into freedom from all\nfabrications (fabrication as in attachment to intrinsic existence). I classify it under the +A of emptiness in\nATR context. This is very similar to Dogen's total exertion.\n965\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nIppo-gujin (total exertion), I will define here as wholehearted engagement in the mundane activities of\neverydayness of everyday, essentially no different from bahiya sutta of in the seen just the seen. In this\nactualisation, entire \"body mind environment universe\" is one participation without any need to subsume\ninto an all encompassing substantial non-dual awareness; instead all conventional diversities are fully intact\nyet miraculously involved in a harmonious unity.\nWhen I read Tsongkhapa's thought somehow I can relate quite easily with my ATR background, from his\n\"one nature different isolates\" to \"mere existence\" to non-dual espistemology via just simply focusing on\nunderstanding \"intrinsic existence\" thoroughly.\nDogen's total exertion is the mystical and zen-ish approach of epistemic non-dual and often presented in\na cryptic manner whereas Tsongkhapa's is the rational, logical and systematic way towards epistemic\nnon-dual. I think they make good complements. Unfortunately I know too little of Tsongkhapa's tantric\nteachings to understand how his views are being integrated into his tantric practices.\nRobert Thurman came to my mind when Edmond Cigale mentioned about him. Since he was the Je\nTsongkhapa Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia Universits and once commented that\nDogen's Zen is very tantric, I think it will be interesting if he has an article on it. In case u write to him, pls\ndon't mention abt ATR, Soh Wei Yu will create havoc out of it. ” – John Tan\n“The world of interrelatedness by Adyashanti is total exertion. To me I would say the gelugpas or\nTsongkhapa view is more total exertion (+A) and Mipham is more the tradition school of freedom from\nextremes (-A).” – John Tan\n“That is great insight but not just thoughts, sound, smell..etc. What about colors, lights...vividly vision?\nWhere is the lurid scenery right before the eyes now? Don't privileged mind over phenomena or\nphenomena over mind.\nIt does not only apply only to referent of conceptual constructs r not found, even non-dual presence is not\nfound...taste this not found deeply...the -A...\nThen look at DO....if mind is de-constructed, there is no mind and into anatta, and phenomena too are\ndeconstructed....without privileging either mind or phenomena, move deeply into dependent\ndesignation/origination, taste the formation, deconstruction and see the freedom of natural and\nspontaneous perfection.\nPost anatta, insight is not so much about the radiance of presence, that is a given, it is the +A and -A taste...”\n– John Tan\n966\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n\"One doesn't realize how beautiful Prasangika nominalism truly is. If you genuinely want to explore it, don't\nwaste time on unfruitful discussions with Jax or by continuously pasting things to me. Rather, focus on total\nexertion and dependent designations; they integrate so perfectly and beautifully, creating an entire\nworldview in themselves. This perspective includes everything without either dispelling or affirming the\ninternal and external worlds—a true middle way—and bases its entire worldview on names alone, which is\nprofoundly beautiful, especially as it allows for the integration of anatta, total exertion, and emptiness. I've\nonly recently come to appreciate this as I seriously contemplate Tsongkhapa’s semantic nominalism. I now\nvalue the two truths even more, especially the conventional world, when viewed with the experiential\ninsight of total exertion.\nActually, you can't just read about Tsongkhapa’s semantic nominalism; you must integrate it with an\nunderstanding of total exertion and emptiness, without resorting to mere non-conceptuality—just the\nlinguistics beauty with all the constructs. Your current experiences and insights are sufficient to integrate\nthese perspectives. The positive and negative aspects (+A and -A) blend perfectly, and the flavors of anatta,\nemptiness, and total exertion harmonize beautifully. Internal and external worlds are bridged by the\nconcept of 'names only.' It’s no wonder that Tsongkhapa does not reject the external world and does not\nneed a reflexive awareness. By the way, I do not know whether it is Tsongkhapa’s view but it is just beautiful\nwhen seen in light of total exertion and emptiness.\nHowever, Alan Wallace’s notion of 'coming into existence' is also extremely important.\" – John Tan\n~ Total Exertion and Maha (+A)\nIn earlier writings, John Tan used Maha as a descriptor and in latter writings he used both “Maha” and “Total\nExertion”, but what they are describing is the same. Maha is a Sanskrit word that means “great”, which you\ncan understand as infinite vastness without boundaries. In the experience of Maha/total exertion, there is\nthe experience that the centerless and boundless infinitude of the universe, i.e. all conditions of the ten\ndirections (spatial) and three times (temporal), are exerting even a simple activity of breathing, eating and\nwalking. Upon the maturing of insights even after anatta realization, as John Tan wrote in 2009, that Maha\nmust become a natural state. It should be your persisting baseline experience, without which the anatta\nexperience and insight has not fully matured.”\n“The Maha experience that I share with longchen [Sim Pern Chong] is very important. After the maturing\nof non-dual experience, this greatness without boundaries and universe doing the work is also understood\nas part of the natural state.” - John Tan, 2009\nWatch these two very good videos by A. H. Almaas which describes total exertion:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2022/01/ahalmaas.html\nJohn Tan likes another quote by A. H. Almaas: “Understanding the orientation of continual practice, the\n967\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nattitude of devotion to what is real, gets us closer to the mystery of the relationship between practice and\nrealization. When we first learn to practice, we usually have an experience of ourselves practicing. As we\ncome to more thoroughly understand the nature of the self and of reality, our sense of self transforms until,\nat some point, we realize that when one is practicing, when one is meditating, when one is inquiring, when\none is chanting, it is not one particular individual that is practicing, it is the totality of all that there is that is\npracticing. The more continual our practice and the more unflagging our orientation toward reality, the\nmore our understanding of who or what practices can shift from an identified self to the totality of reality.”\n“Maha means great without boundaries. When I use the term ‘Maha’, I am expressing an experience of that\nimmensity… what causes or what are the conditions that trigger ‘maha’?\n1. Samadhi in a prolonged period of oneness\n2. Total exertion where one feels so immensely connected with everything\n3. A prolonged period of non-dual experience where the boundaries of subject and object dissolves\n4. Non-doership into action\nIn whatever cases, the sense of self drops and evaporates. But how the sense of self drops is the question.\nIs it a form of insight like anatta or is it an experience or a particular state?” - John Tan, 2019\n\"Total exertion has 2 flavors: the interpermeation and interpenetration of all things and wholeheartedness\nof action without self/Self.\", “Total exertion is not just interpenetration. Maha is an experience of great\nbeyond measure. It is an experience of everything being consumed as it. Only in anatta this experience can\nbe accessed without much issue. So [for] I AM if [one is] without that experience [of I AM] is short of I\nAM… ...I have told you experientially there is no difference [between I AM and anatta]. Only a refinement\nof view.” ~ John Tan, 2019\n“In ceremony there are forms and there are sounds, there is understanding and there is believing. In\nliturgy there is only intimacy. Haven't you heard the ancient master's teaching: Seeing forms with the\nwhole body-and-mind, hearing sounds with the whole body-and-mind one understands them intimately.\nIntimate understanding is not like ordinary understanding. Ordinary understanding is seeing with the eye\nand hearing with the ear; intimacy is seeing with the ear and hearing with the eye. How do you see with\nthe ear and hear with the eye? Let go of the eye, and the whole body-and-mind are nothing but the eye;\nlet go of the ear, and the whole universe is nothing but the ear.” - Zen Master Dogen, Shobogenzo\n“Six stream experiences is just a convenient raft. Nothing ultimate. Not only must you see that there is no\nSeer + seeing + seen… you must see the immense connectedness.” - John Tan, 2012\n“Also in between ”seeing the Ocean as extra” to directly experiencing the “total exertion in the\nceaselessness of this ongoing activity”, a process of maturing the insight of anatta is necessary. By\nmaturing I am referring to the ending of any reification of mind-objects be it \"Self/self\", \"here/now\",\n968\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n\"mind\", \"body\", \"weather\"... -- there is no \"Self/self\", only changing aggregates; no \"body\", only changing\nsensations; no “here and now” besides changing phenomena; no \"weather\" besides changing clouds, rain\nand sun shines. If this insight can be thoroughly extended to whatever arises then the\ninterconnectedness and total exertion of this moment will become clear and obvious. So much so that\nwhen eating an apple, the universe tastes it! -- the full exertion of the apple, the hand, the taste, the\nthroat, the stomach, the everything of everything is completely transcended into this simple action of\nsuchness where nothing is excluded. Here again, do take note that this \"total exertion\" is not the result of\nbeing fully concentrated; it is the natural outcome when practitioners have adequately embraced the\n'view' of 2 fold emptiness.” - John Tan, 2011, https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2011/03/realization-\nexperience-and-right-view_13.html\n\"Therefore the enlightened penetrates beyond forms, situations, conditions, all arbitrary opinions and\ncommunicates directly. The simplest thing that is indivisibly whole, is no different from this breathe, this\nsound. A thousands years ago, a thousand years later and now, still, this breathe, this sound. Neither the\nsame nor different, always so primordial.\" – John Tan, 2009\n“Birth is just like riding in a boat. You raise the sails and you steer. Although you maneuver the sail and the\npole, the boat gives you a ride, and without the boat you couldn’t ride. But you ride in the boat, and your\nriding makes the boat what it is. Investigate a moment such as this. At just such a moment, there is nothing\nbut the world of the boat. The sky, the water, and the shore are all the boat’s world, which is not the same\nas a world that is not the boat’s. Thus you make birth what it is; you make birth your birth. When you ride\nin a boat, your body, mind, and environs together are the undivided activity of the boat. The entire earth\nand the entire sky are both the undivided activity of the boat. Thus birth is nothing but you; you are nothing\nbut birth.” - Dogen\n“Life is, for example, like a time when a person is riding in a boat. In this boat, the person operates the sail;\nthe person manages the rudder. Although the person rows with the oar, the boat gives the person person\na ride and, other than the boat, there is no such person as a self. The person rides in the boat and the\nperson makes this boat into a boat. We should make efforts to study this very moment. This very moment\nis nothing but the world of the boat. The sky, the water, and the shore; all of those become the time of the\nboat: it is not the same with the time of something else other than the boat. Therefore, we give birth to life;\nlife makes us into ourselves.” - Dogen (Okumura, Shohaku. The Mountains and Waters Sutra: A\nPractitioner's Guide to Dogen's \"Sansuikyo\" (p. 74). Wisdom Publications. Kindle Edition.)\n“When riding in a boat, our body and mind, ourselves and the environment — all become the functioning\nof the boat. The entire earth and the entire space become the functioning of the boat.”\nOkumura, Shohaku. The Mountains and Waters Sutra: A Practitioner's Guide to Dogen's \"Sansuikyo\" (pp.\n73-74).

Kindle Edition.\n969\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“The universe is this arising thought.\nThe universe is this arising sound.\nJust this magnificent arising!\nIs Tao.\nHomage to all arising.”\n- John Tan, 2009\n(+A)\nWhen you cook, there is no self that cooks, only the activity of cooking. The hands moves, the utensils act,\nthe water boils, the potatoes peels …here there is no room for simplicity or complications, the “kitchen”\nwent beyond its own imputation and dissolved into the activity of cooking and the universe is fully\nengaged in this cooking.\nJohn Tan, 2013\n“Wondrous! Marvelous!\nThe teachings of the insentient are inconceivable.\nIf you listen with the ears, you won't understand.\nWhen you hear with the eyes, then you will know.” - Zen Master Dongshan\n“When I talk about listening, I don’t mean just listening with the ear. Listening here includes the totality of\nperception—all senses open and alive, and still much more than that. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and\nmind are receptive, open, not controlled. A Zen saying describes it as “hearing with one’s eyes and seeing with\none’s ears.” It refers to this wholeness of perception. The wholeness of being!\nAnother Zen saying demands: “Hear the bell before it rings!” Ah, it doesn’t make any sense rationally, does it?\nBut there is a moment when that bell is ringing before you know it! You may never know it! Your entire being is\nringing! There’s no division in that—everything is ringing.”” - Toni Packer, The Wonder of Presence, excerpt\nfrom Finding a New Way to Listen\n“Therefore To study the mind is to study the myriad forms. To study the myriad forms is to study the\ndependently originated appearance at this instantaneous moment. To study this instantaneous moment\nis to understand the full exertion of the 'interconnected universe' and this full exertion is expressed\nwithout reservation as this vivid moment of arising sound...this breath...this passing thought...this\nobviously clear scenery...\nand\nInstantly Gone!” - John Tan, 2011, https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2011/03/realization-experience-\nand-right-view_13.html\n970\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“And this is the whole purpose of anatta. To thoroughly see through that this background does not exist\nin actuality. What exists is a stream, action or karma. There is no doer or anything being done, there is\nonly doing; No meditator nor meditation, only meditating. From a letting go perspective, \"a watcher\nwatching thought\" will create the impression that a watcher is allowing thoughts to arise and subside\nwhile itself being unaffected. This is an illusion; it is 'holding' in disguise as 'letting go'. When we realized\nthat there is no background from start, reality will present itself as one whole letting go. With practice,\n‘intention’ dwindles with the maturing of insight and ‘doing’ will be gradually experienced as mere\nspontaneous happening as if universe is doing the work. With the some pointers from 'dependent\norigination', we can then penetrate further to see this happening as a sheer expression of everything\ninteracting with everything coming into being. In fact, if we do not reify ‘universe’, it is just that -- an\nexpression of interdependent arising that is just right wherever and whenever is.\nUnderstanding this, practice is simply opening to whatever is.\nFor this mere happening is just right wherever and whenever is.\nThough no place can be called home it is everywhere home.\nWhen experience matures in the practice of great ease,\nThe experience is Maha! Great, miraculous and bliss.\nIn mundane activities of seeing, eating and tasting,\nWhen expressed poetically is as if the entire universe meditating.\nWhatever said and expressed are really all different flavors,\nOf this everything of everything dependently originating,\nAs this moment of vivid shimmering.” - John Tan, 2009\n“If we were to breathe in and out, in and out…till there is simply this entire sensation of breath, just\nbreath as all causes and conditions coming into this moment of manifestation.\nIf we were to focus on the sensation of stepping, the sensation of hardness, just the sensation of the\nhardness, till there is simply this entire sensation ‘hardness’ when the feet touches the ground, just this\n‘hardness’ as all causes and conditions coming into this moment of manifestation.\nIf we were to focus on hearing someone hitting a bell, the stick, the bell, the vibration of the air, the ears\nall coming together for this sensation of sound to arise, we will have Maha experience.\n...\nHowever ever since incorporating the teaching of dependent origination into non-dual presence, over the\nyears it has become more ‘accessible’ but never has this been understood as a ground state. There seems\n971\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nto be a predictable relationship of seeing interdependent arising and emptiness on the experience of\nnon-dual presence.\nA week ago, the clear experience of Maha dawned and became quite effortless and at the same time\nthere is a direct realization that it is also a natural state. In Sunyata, Maha is natural and must be fully\nfactored into the path of experiencing whatever arises. Nevertheless Maha as a ground state requires the\nmaturing of non-dual experience; we cannot feel entirely as the interconnectedness of everything coming\nspontaneously into being as this moment of vivid manifestation with a divided mind.” - John Tan, 2009\n“In Maha, one does not feel self, one 'feels' universe; one does not feel 'Brahman' but feels\n'interconnectedness'; one does not feel 'helplessness' due to 'dependence and interconnection' but feels\ngreat without boundary, spontaneous and marvelous.” - John Tan, 2009\n“To say the universe is involved in this action as if differentiated entities is not exactly correct. Cause is\nneither same nor different from effect, like sun and rays. And in terms of yogic taste, it is more accurate\nto describe it in terms of “the universe is the action.”\nWhen you breathe, is the air in the environment, the nose, or the lungs and diaphragm that is breathing?\nThe universe is the breathing\n…\nYes.. There is no “outside” to the infinitude of total exertion” - Soh, 2019\n“Total exertion is direct realization of each manifest activity as arising with all conditions in seamless\ninterdependency, where one feels that the whole universe is giving its best to make this moment\npossible.\nI started having glimpses and insights into this about one or two years after my initial realisation of anatta\n(the direct realisation and penetration of the false dichotomy of subject-action-object through\ncontemplating the verse in Bahiya Sutta) back in 2010. Anatta demolishes the background subject so that\nthere is only the entirety of manifestation, and then you may penetrate further -- this entirety of\nmanifestation is a seamless activity with no self-nature anywhere. When I experienced this I called it the\n\"dharma body\". When walking not only are the legs walking, the whole universe is walking, the whole\nuniverse is your body. To put it in laymen's term, it's like the universe as your body (but the word universe\ndoesn't really capture the dynamic, interdependent and empty nature of it well).\nLet me give you an example. Recently, I was sitting in meditation with my sister. Then as usual I entered\ninto a blissful state. In that state, I saw that it's not me sitting here, like there is no I, no sister, no baby,\netc, but it's really all these factors that is \"meditating\" plus much more... all the way back to the time of\n972\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nthe Buddha! The living presence of Buddha and its sangha and the whole lineage is right here, same time\nand in communion. This breath is the universe. Suddenly some passages by Dogen made perfect sense*\nAlso, I just visited a Zen temple earlier today to meditate. Something that the novice monk said after the\nmeditation struck me - chanting as \"together action\". He didn't elaborate what he meant by that but I\nintuited its meaning and purpose. To me what this means is this - when we practice as a community, we\nare enacting \"together action\" so that it is not you that is chanting but the chanting as a whole arising\nseamlessly that is chanting. But \"together action\" is in fact every moment! This breath is together action\nwith all the conditions, the whole community and lineage. Carrying your meditation cushion and waiting\nfor your turn to place that cushion back to its original place -- together action, not 'you' action.\nWalking on the street, you look at the traffic and maneuver your way to reach your destination, the traffic\nand people walking are as much an inseparable part of the activity which you call 'your walking', each\nmoment of walking is doing together action with all conditions. The same for driving a car. If you lose the\n\"zone\", if you get distracted and are not practicing \"together action\", watch out! Lives can be lost.\nWhen you are walking in the park, the legs moving arise in tandem with the whole universe moving. The\ntree in front is manifesting the way it is in accord with all other conditions like the wind, light, the way I am\nmoving and looking, etc. The tree has no tree-ness in itself or apart from me and I have no me-ness apart\nfrom the interplay that is manifesting the tree. When I see and interact with others, it's not I interacting\nwith others as I and others are empty and dissolved in the interplay. Truly it is like a node of Indra\nreflecting all other nodes, each node is not other than all others nodes, there is neither self nor others.\n'Self' and 'others' are learnt and is a result of the ignorance of our true nature. The structures of language\nor convention posits that when we encounter something it is always 'I' am touching/encountering a 'thing'\nas if there is a real subject interacting with an object. I am I and interacting or talking with a real other as\ndiscrete entities.\nAlthough in actual experience it's just all conditions in total exertion but when spoken in language it\nappears separate. The structure of language is dualistic.. which is not a problem in itself when taken\nconventionally or as dependent designation but instead we wrongly reified them into things with its own\nexistence in and of themselves.\n*e.g.,\nThe Buddhas and Ancestors manifest before our very eyes whenever we respectfully serve the Buddhas\nand Ancestors by bringing Them up through our presenting of Their story. They are not limited simply to\nsome past, present, or future time, for They have undoubtedly gone beyond even ‘going beyond Buddha’.\nShobogenzo, Busso, Hubert Nearman\n973\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThe robe of the right transmission of the buddhas and patriarchs is not arbitrarily transmitted from\nbuddha to buddha. It is the robe transmitted from the former buddha to the later buddha, and from the\nancient buddha to the contemporaneous buddha. In order to transform the Way, to transform the\nbuddha, and to transform the past, present, and future, there is a right transmission from past to\npresent, from present to future, from present to past, from past to past, from present to present, from\nfuture to future, from future to present, and from future to past. It is the right transmission only between\na buddha and a buddha.\n- Dogen\n“Yes, it is a word used by Dogen, ippo-gujin.\nDavid Loy:\n\"...These techniques are used to exemplify his notion of ippo-gujin, 'the total exertion of a single dharma.'\nThis key term embodies his dynamic understanding of interpenetration, according to which each dharma\nin the universe is both cause and effect of all other dharmas. This interfusion means that the life of one\ndharma becomes the life of all dharmas, so that (as Zen masters like to say), *this* is the only thing in the\nwhole universe!\"”\nJohn Tan replied:\nWei Yu,\nWell quoted, well written and well expressed! So much to my liking that I have to say something\n.\nLet’s visit our last discussion. As I said,\nThere is no self, only a sense of self.\nNo seer, only a sense of seer.\nTherefore no conflict with your direct insight of anatta.\n974\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThe SENSE of self is designated as “seer” that dependently originates when forms vividly appears due to\nthe karmic tendencies of ignorance. Ascribing the phenomena “seen” to a non-existing seer, is the action,\nthe act of seeing.\nIgnorance is not \"inability to know\". Instead it is a very deep form inherent and dualistic knowing that\nsees in the karmic pattern of seer-seeing-seen.\nNow the question:\nIs there a need to exhaust this karmic pattern of seer-seeing-seen by pacifying conceptualization?\nIf so then the practice of anatta to empty clarity:\n1. In seeing, just the seen. No seer.\n2. In seeing, always only the seen. Therefore no seeing.\n3. In the seen, just the seen.\nWhere is the seen?\nWhere is this vivid lurid scenery?\nNo where to be found,\nSpontaneous, empty and non-arisen.\nSo how does total exertion step in?\nIf there is no need to exhaust karmic patterning, then how should you practice?\nI (Soh) replied: The solidifying of what’s sensed into something truly there is a total exertion of karmic\ntendency, the appearance can seem very real but actually nothing real.\nThe sense of standing on this side as a seer is likewise itself the total exertion of karmic tendency, an\nactivity and not an actual entity behind anything.\nSeer and seen, grasper and grasped, liberated not through pacifying conceptualization but seeing the\nabsence and total exertion of all afflicted and non afflicted phenomena.\nJohn Tan:\nWell said.\nThe self designated upon the aggregates was never there but felt to be solidly there.\n975\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n\"Here\" that is so undeniably \"here\" is nothing \"here\". Only sensations and thoughts forming the\nimpression of being “solidly here\".\nAs for this:\n\"Seer and seen, grasper and grasped, liberated not through pacifying conceptualization but seeing the\nabsence and total exertion of all afflicted and non afflicted phenomena.\"\nImo, buddhism non-dual is not the union of subject-object or seer is the seen but freedom from\nextremes.\nIt liberates seer from seer and seen from seen by seeing dependent arising.\nAlso,\nThe afflictive chain is released by the pacification of mental proliferation but not through dry non-\nconceptuality. Like what you said can be by:\n1. Direct insight of anatta into empty clarity.\n2. Total exertion.\nHowever in total exertion, doing away with self is not necessary. It is fully embraced and fully\nauthenticated by 10 thousand things. Most of your articles seem quite persistent in trying to get rid of\n“self” even when expressing total exertion. In total exertion, emptiness and endless dependencies of\ndharma (including self) are a given otherwise total exertion is not possible. Every dharma is purified by its\nown endless dependencies.\nYour expression of timelessness of total exertion is precious. The moment Dogen writes and the moment\nyou realise is one exertion. Transmission is indeed heart to heart, timeless and intimate!\nAnd\n3. Persistently seeing of whatever arises dependently is free from extremes will eventually free the mind.\nConsistently seeing neither self nor no-self, neither arise nor not-arise, breaks the chain of mental\nproliferation.\nSelf and the ten thousand things,\nNeither one nor many.\nNot one, therefore no self nature.\n976\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nNot two, therefore seamless.\nOne line of reasoning,\nfreedom from 2 extremes.\nDependent arising is the king of reasoning.” - Soh, 2017\n“While walking in the Singapore botanic gardens just now, the total exertion of universe walking, then the\ntotal exertion of a single thought is experienced, and the analogy arose - even a repetitive \"discursive\"\nthought is Maha total exertion, like the echo is the echo of the universe, but that thought is the echo of\nthe three times. Of course at that point those are not discursive thoughts.” - Soh, 2019\n“Now Appearing: Everything, EveryWhere, and EveryWhen. Ta-Da\nIn addition to the paradigm-shifting realization that there was no separate me to carry around containers\ncalled 'memories', 'hurts', 'accomplishments', or 'regrets, there were two more shifts I wanted to tell you\nabout, dear reader. Why do I feel the need to document it? I'm not certain. It feels like it's time to let folks\nknow what's happened here, especially those seekers who've come to me for pointers on anatta\nrealization. I mean, this whole business of guiding people, whether for money or on a volunteer basis, is\njust pretty weird when viewed from a conventional perspective. Where are the credentials? At any rate, I'll\ntell you about a second shift. It had everything to do with the Bahiya Sutta and contemplation of each\nline. I'd been reading Soh Wei Yu's AwakeningtoReality blog and followed a rabbit trail of links to Alex\nWeith's journal on his own progress in working with the sutta. (I've since been unable to find the journal).\nIn addition, I'd continued reading on in Wei Yu's blog, especially the sections where he'd gotten into ideas\nabout realizing emptiness and interdependence.... although at the time I didn't realize it was called\nemptiness.\nThe story: Relaxing by the side of a pool, I read and contemplated for hours, then glanced up to notice a\nsnail sitting on the very edge of the lip, the place where water in motion rolls into a very sudden\ninterruption, causing a wave. The snail seemed, in my mind anyway, to be struggling against what must\nhave seemed like a relentless series of tsunamis. He teetered on the edge, each moment threatening to\nsend him into the depths. (that's three feet of water to you and me). When I looked across to pool to find\nthe source of this epic disturbance, I saw a woman sporting a sublime but bright smile brought about\nfrom basking in the glow of Sunshine and Saturdays. Despite her generous size, she appeared to\ndelicately occupy her perch at the deep end. Thoroughly enjoy her afternoon, she lazily and delicately\nswished her feet back and forth, then sighed. It was then that the thunder of interdependence struck. Like\nsome sort of special effects movie, I 'saw', all at once, the woman, the water, the sun, the breeze, the\nweather, her parents, her grandparents and ancestors, the earth, the universe. And from the other end of\nthe spectrum there was the snail, his ever-growing shell, and every movement that had led him to the\nmoment of finding himself at his poolside ledge. Then there was the pool, the workers who'd constructed\nit, the water which filled it, and the rain and evaporation that moved the water. Everywhere I looked,\nEverything appeared. For lack of a better way to express this, what I saw could be expressed as a\n977\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\ncomplete and whole view of anything at all that ever existed. Not only that, but that it had to exist\nPRECISELY as it had in order for this very moment to be as it was. Ta-Da. It would increasingly come to me\nthat this is seen not just in that moment, but all the time, everywhere, and in every 'thing'. Total exertion,\nand I do mean Total, is what This is. The simultaneous complexity and simplicity of this is absolutely mind\nblowing in the best sort of sense. What's more, it's not static and not inherent. It's what it appears to be\nright now, but not a thing there at all. Forget the nihilistic teachings that say there are no things for a\nsecond and just look at the experience of what appears. The Total Exertion still applies. That this blog\npost is being typed is It. The whole shebang. It's the appearance that contains the appearances of 'my\nentire history' which includes the history of existence. That it's being read by a you is the whole thing too.\nEverything that is normally thought of as \"YOU\" is right here. This also means that EveryWhen and\nEveryWhere is appearing too. Very much like examining a fractal, zoom in at any point, and it's All there.\nAmazing, isn't it?” - Delma McConnell, 2014\n“Total exertion is not a zone state as many misrepresented. It is a very deep shift in perception from\nrealization post anatta. It is not of effort. However before that it is advisable to have a technique to focus\nquality time on the state of no-mind for an initial taste.” - John Tan, 2019\n978\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n- Hale Oh\n“Hale OHerren\nHale OHerren I have a couple of classes in a row here where I have to pay attention lol... will explain in a\nfew hours\n1\nLike\n· Reply · 1y\nHale OHerren\nHale OHerren The diagram is a progress seeing of our relationship to the world. \"a\" is not \"a\", therefore \"a\"\nis \"a\" applied out.\nThe stick figure is a person, the small boxes are any/all dharmas, the arrows and lines show relationship,\nthe big box in #3 is a representation of the whole world/universe, the huge box in #4 is all space time.\n#1 is how most people see.

This world makes me, and I make this world. The arrows\npoint back and forth to show a mutual relationship.\n#3 brings in a larger context, its seeing the wholeness of this moment. Not only am I and the world co\ncreated, but each and everything exists together like a web. Everything moving together in harmony,\nnothing separate… Not only #2 but also a more whole picture of the present moment. This whole moment\nis one seamless happening. Each piece, including you, is integral to the whole, and the whole is integral to\neach piece. A car (a) is nothing without a road to drive on, a person to drive, an earth etc (not a). But, this is\nlooked at and seen in the moment and felt.\n#4 is taking #3 and applying time. Each point is the \"crux\" or \"fulcrum\" of space time. Everything \"hinges\"\nso to speak on the bell ringing. Each \"a\" is empty (not a) because it only exists in context with all space time.\nTherefore, \"a\" is just \"a\" haha, which is all things all places all times. And all that is just \"a\". It's seeing the\nwholeness of each and every thing, indra's net real time.

Pais Hale, from the Golden Lion link. It's interesting...\n6. To discuss the five doctrines. The first: although the lion is a dharma produced through dependent-\narising, it undergoes generation and destruction in each and every moment. [Since nothing in the\n980\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nphenomenal world endures,] no form of the lion can ever be found. This is called the teaching for the\nignorant Śrāvakas [Hīnayāna].\nThe second: all things, being the product of dependent-arising, are devoid of Selfhood [Svabhāva], and in\nthe final analysis, are nothing but Emptiness. This is called the preliminary teaching of Mahāyāna.\nThe third: although all things are Emptiness through and through, this does not impede the vivid\nappearance of the Māyā/becoming. All that which is of dependent-arising is fictitiously existent [and\ntherefore it is truly void.] This co-existence of both being and non-being is called the final teaching of\nMahāyāna.\nThe fourth: inasmuch as these two characters [that of Emptiness and that of form] mutually annul each\nother, they are both abolished. Here, no imaginings or false presuppositions exist; neither the concept of\nEmptiness nor the idea of existence retains any influence. [This is the sphere in which] the ideas of both\nbeing and non-being vanish. It is a realm that names and speech cannot reach. Here the mind rests without\nany attachment. This is called the instantaneous teaching of Mahāyāna.\nThe fifth: when all false feelings and wrong ideas are eliminated, and the true substance is revealed,\neverything becomes merged into one great mass. Great functions then arise in abundance, and whatever\narises is absolutely true. The myriad manifestations, despite their variety, interpenetrate without confusion\nor disarray. The all is the one, for both are empty in substance. The one is the all, for cause and effect clearly\nmanifest themselves [without fail]. In their power and functions [the one and the all] embrace each other.\nThey spread out and roll up in utter freedom. This is called the Round Doctrine of the One Vehicle.\nLike\n· Reply · 1y\nHale OHerren\nHale OHerren André, and all the rest of what he has to say haha.

Before I review the\nmeaning of the title, let me say that when you truly just chant the Heart Sutra, all of it is contained in the\nact of just chanting. When we chant in such a way that nothing else is happening, that all our\nconcentration, all our mental and physical energies are condensed into just being the sound A (the first\nsyllable of the original text, from \"Avalokitesvara\"), that is all that exists. Just A! Just the elimination of any\ntrace of separation between subject and object, which is nothing but our zazen itself. If we put all our\nenergy into just chanting in this manner, there is no separation, and that state of no separation is the\nstate of sunyata, or \"emptiness,\" or what I also call not-knowing. That is the state of 100 percent action;\neverything is fully concentrated in this very moment. This is the heart of our practice, to be totally in this\nmoment, moment after moment.

The grass, trees, soil, earth reached by this guiding\ninfluence all radiate great brightness, and their preaching of the deep and fine dharma is without end.\n~ Zen Master Dogen\n“...In the main story, a young man was a student of Master Gutei. This student didn't seem to realize what\nhe was learning or practicing. Dogen comments, \"a boy who attended Master Gutei (Judi), without\nnoticing when he was learning or when he was practicing, realized the Way because he served as a\npersonal attendant to the master who had been practicing for a long time.\" In the course of attending to\nMaster Gutei, he attained realization.\n988\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBy focusing on the activity of helping Master Gutei every day, the student was not aware he was being\ntrained. He probably spent his time making the master's bed and fetching tea. Yet those activities, in\naccord with Master Gutei's instruction, created his passage from student to master. This transformation\nwas due to the confluence of all the activities: all the befores and afters and the independent moments of\nthe student's life with the master. His interactions with Master Gutei resulted in his total immersion in\npractice-realization. Transformation was always present, yet there was a particular moment of its\nrecognition when Master Gutei acknowledged his passage into spiritual maturity.\nAnother example is found in \"Udonge\" (The Udumbara Flower). Dogen explains the awakening of\nBuddha's disciple Mahakasyapa. Buddha holds up a flower. Mahakasyapa, seeing the flower, smiles. The\nmoment of Buddha-flower-smile is passageless-passage. Dogen describes it this way:\n'All instances, however many, of the twirling of flowers, are individual instances of [the transmission from]\nrightful successor to rightful successor; they are the actual existence of the transmission. Indeed, forget\nthe World-Honored One's twirling of a flower!... Because the time of twirling of flowers is the whole of\nTime itself, it is the experience of the same state as the World-Honored One, and it is the same twirling of\nflowers. The meaning of 'twirling flowers' is flowers displaying flowers [phenomena manifesting\nthemselves as they are]: it is plum flowers, spring flowers, snow flowers, and lotus flowers.'\nFurthermore,\n'Twirling flowers are twirled by eyes, twirled by mind-consciousnesss, twirled by nostrils, and twirled by\nflowers twirling. In general, the mountains, rivers, and the Earth; the sun and moon, the wind and rain,\npeople, animals, grass, and trees - the miscellaneous things of the present displaying themselves here\nand there - are just the twirling of the udumbara flower.'\nJust one flower being held up for display is passage through all time and being, awakening each and every\nthing. This is what Mahakasyapa realized. Essentially his realization was already present as his own being,\nyet it was the passage of all buddha-nature in and through him that revealed his true nature. This is our\npassage too.” - Being-Time by Shinshu Roberts\n\"Modern \"mindfulness\" meditation is just sitting quietly, following the breath, accepting the moment,\nbeing mindful of what's happening in the moment. That's all good, and it is helpful to many. However,\npeople sometimes call that \"Shikantaza\" these days, and even some teachers make the mistake. I cannot\nagree that such languid sitting is what Master Dogen meant as \"Shikantaza.\"\nShikantaza in Dogen's expression is a way that sits as all timeless time and every atom of space sitting in\nour sitting, \"dropping body-mind,\" dropping the self/other divide while still in this life and world of self\nand other and passing time. This sitting embodies the Wholeness that is Emptiness, in which our very\nsitting is Buddha sitting.\nOne sits vibrantly, with sincerity and dedication ... yet there is nothing to attain. One is unentangled,\nthough in life's tangled circumstances. One sits, in radical equanimity, letting thoughts go, not running\ntoward yet not running away from thoughts. One comes to see the Light of Clarity and Wholeness which\n989\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nshines through both thoughts and no thoughts. One sits for a time, free of measures of time. Sitting sits\nsitting for sitting's sake. Sitting is the fruition of all of life in that moment of sitting.\nShikantaza is a Gateless Gateway to Liberation, not mere relaxation, accumulation, recreation or\nremuneration.\nIt is too easy to confuse \"mindfulness\" and \"Shikantaza.\"\"\n- Zen Master Jundo Cohen\n“Yes, it is a word used by Dogen, ippo-gujin.\nDavid Loy:\n\"...These techniques are used to exemplify his notion of ippo-gujin, 'the total exertion of a single dharma.'\nThis key term embodies his dynamic understanding of interpenetration, according to which each dharma\nin the universe is both cause and effect of all other dharmas. This interfusion means that the life of one\ndharma becomes the life of all dharmas, so that (as Zen masters like to say), *this* is the only thing in the\nwhole universe!\"” - Soh, 2017\n“Room is hot, whole body is the burning! Feel it, live it without second thought.” - Soh, 2015\n“Dogen Zenji continues, saying: Seeing each thing in this entire world as a moment of time . See each\nthing as a moment of time: each thing or each being, just a moment. I think this is related with the\npractice of Avalokiteshvara, or Kanjizai, as we say in the Sino-Japanese pronunciation: the one who\nhears the world. And there we have to be aware of Mumon's words in one of the poems of the\nMumonkan, when he says:\nIf you listen with your ear, it's hard to understand\nIf you hear with your eye, you are intimate at last\nSeeing with the eyes is good, but not enough. You have to hear with your eyes and see with your ears.\nSo the one that hears the sounds of the world is not merely concerned with hearing, but with total\nfunction of our whole body-and-mind, involving all of our senses and, of course, involving completely\nour own body. This is the quality of true zazen, seeing each thing as a moment of time, just a moment,\nwith no continuity at all. Just a moment, with no trace remaining. Of course, when Dogen says “seeing\nit”, he means ‘being completely intimate with’. At that point he says time is not really time; time itself is\nbeing, and all being is time.”\n990\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n- http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeac.../augusto/TimeBeing_1.htm\n\"It is good you are seeing the fabrications working together to shape a dualistic experience. That is seeing\nthe afflictive dependent origination, seeing that selfing-activity, duality, grasping as the very activity that\ndependently originates. Therefore there is no self/Self/agent, but there is the afflictive sense of self,\ngrasping and reification in action. There is no actor but there is action, be it afflictive or non-afflictive.. it is\nnot an agent giving rise to afflictive activities but afflictive activities giving rise to selfing through\ndependent arising\nAs for total exertion and maha, that is more on the non-afflictive side of dependent origination, the\ngeneral principle of dependent origination. You will see that the +A expressions are all over in Dogen's\nwritings, whereas the Mahamudra/Tibetan tends to emphasize more on -A. (Update: There are always\nexceptions, such as Elias Capriles from Dzogchen tradition expressing Maha total exertion:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/06/elias-caprilles-interviewed-by-vladimir.html, and Zen\nMaster Hong Wen Liang (洪文亮禅师) integrating total exertion with illusoriness in some of his\nexpressions)\nI started having mini glimpses of total exertionas early as 2011 but only had very clear experiences of it\nbeginning in 2013 where I wrote about dharma body -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2013/09/dharma-body_7.html -- where even the walking activity\nis as immense and boundless as the whole universe, a seamless activity of mind-body-universe.\nJohn Tan used the word Maha and Total Exertion to describe this, it is about totality. Maha means great,\nbut it is not big vs small, but great without boundaries. Immense as the universe. As he often said, be light\nas feather but immense as the universe.\nNowadays the infinitude of maha total exertion has become a natural, effortless state as an ongoing\nexperience. When you are doubtless and stabilized anatta, you must mature your insight and experience\nin this direction.\nThat Maha total exertion must become a natural state, as written in\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html -\n\"A week ago, the clear experience of Maha dawned and became quite effortless and at the same time\nthere is a direct realization that it is also a natural state. In Sunyata, Maha is natural and must be fully\nfactored into the path of experiencing whatever arises. Nevertheless Maha as a ground state requires the\nmaturing of non-dual experience; we cannot feel entirely as the interconnectedness of everything coming\nspontaneously into being as this moment of vivid manifestation with a divided mind.\n991\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThe universe is this arising thought.\nThe universe is this arising sound.\nJust this magnificent arising!\nIs Tao.\nHomage to all arising.\"\n“(10:58 PM) AEN: \"With going the boundless sky goes, with coming the entire earth comes. This\nis everyday mind.\" - Dogen\n(10:59 PM) Thusness: wow… maha. this is experiencing maha in mundane activities.” - 2009\nSoh: “Even if you see the Actual Freedom teachings, there are two stages of actual freedom.\n1) The basic, newly-free actual freedom is characterized by the lack of separative identity, feeling-being,\nmagical and wonderful luminosity as actual time and form,\n\"On the woven table mat my attention was drawn to a dark blue plastic cigarette lighter, an empty glass, a\ntobacco pouch and other sundry items. All of a sudden, Richard’s phrase “the actual world of people,\nthings and events” came to mind and I found myself acknowledging that the things on the table existed in\nactuality, i.e. did in fact actually exist, and this being the case, here I was waving my hand in front of\n“people”, in this case Richard, saying that I experienced him as if behind a veil, i.e. not actually existing. It\ntook only a few more seconds of switching my attention from the things on the table and my waving hand\nfor the whole illusion of a separating veil to collapse – along with my illusory self-centred identity as I was\ngradually becoming aware of.\nThe whole experience was like a seamless transition between two worlds – from being a feeling being\ntrapped within an illusionary all-encompassing self-created and sustained bubble to being here in the\nactual world. There was no dramatic end for ‘me’, no death-like traumatic experience, no prior psychic\nevents or escapades, no “wall of fear”, no “abyss” – rather there was a profound experience of sweetness,\na ready acknowledgement of my destiny and a final understanding that the feeling of separateness was\nnothing other than an illusion of ‘my’ own making.\" - Peter\n\"There was no fear, no experience of death, no physical phenomena or changes, just the realization that I\nhave always been here in this eternal moment in time, in this luminous magical world, more naked than I\nwas born and utterly safe... ...The next morning was the real test – I half-expected that I had reverted back\nto normal but the world was just as brilliant, beneficial and wunderbar as I had experienced it the night\nbefore. I am still surprised how easy it all turned out to be in the end.\" - Vineeto\nThis is why I asked how thorough are you experiencing the 2nd stanza.. as well as the intensity of\nluminosity as vivid form, this is important as well in addition for the aspect of no agent. But from what\nyou messaged me it you are already experiencing that aspect well at the moment.\n992\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n2) The Fully Free actual freedom characterized by permanent experience of infinitude [not just glimpses]\nthat comes soon after the loss of social identity (from what I understand from that website, that includes\nviews, impinging on what actions to take and interpretations of one's pure experience including of that\ninfinitude, sometimes subtly interpreting it wrongly or in terms of metaphysical essence based on the\nconvo of Vineeto with a newly-free person) - to me what I see as more crucial is that the view aspect must\nbe clear. This is also related to the example of the video by Leo on Actualized.org describes the Maha\nTotal Exertion glimpses in 5-Meo-DMT trip, but he is still having view of inherent existence, and\nmisinterpreting that infinitude in terms of metaphysicality in the same way that Vineeto discussed with\nanother guy. With that social identity or 'shadow being' in place, it prevents the permanent experience of\ninfinitude.\nBut that is how AF expresses or interpretes. For you, you just need to be clear on anatta and D.O., that\nwill lead to effortless Maha/total exertion. There must not be a desync of view and experience, otherwise\nit will be a hindrance.\nBut the progression is quite similar -- means anatta in two stanza stabilized, then glimpses of maha total\nexertion, then a shift into permanent total exertion. But AF lacks emptiness.\nAs John Tan wrote previously, “Richard's experience is not different from total exertion. However his\nactual view will be restricting him imo.”\nAnother time in 2019, John Tan said, “AF is no different from affirmative negation. Firmly grounded in the\nactual world of PCE. There is deconstruction but the very insight that deconstruct is not clear. It is focused\non PCE and the cause of deconstruction is not known. Focused on experience more than insights.”\nBack in 2015, John Tan said, “John TanFriday, March 20, 2015 at 10:24am UTC+08\nThe way you described has a lot of over emphasis, there is a lack of intensity but expressed as if you have\nrealized and experienced the intensity of these insights and experiences...lol. You have to reverse the\ncycle of experiences and you stabilize both your insights and experiences. Even in AF (Actual Freedom\nteachings), there is such intensity. When practitioners expressed something like the universe doing the\nwashing of the plates, they are having that experiences… not just to sound nice. In a simple breathing\nprocess, one too undergo deconstruction process to later end up in maha and total exertion. Like in\nexperience, you say you become just the breathing and the universe is inhaling… conceptually you\nunderstand after anatta but the intensity isn't there.\nFor example I tell you to breathe in slowly and deeply for focus in placing your intention on the lower\ndantian to the chest and to the fingertip. Just this process, how do you enter into anatta and a state of\ntotal exertion? I mean a state of no-mind and into total exertion. You say that you think you can breathe\nin slowly and deeply but I can tell just this is enough for you to learn for sometime. To fully understand\n993\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nthe whole mechanics, the whole DO into the seamless act of the pose -- the whole movement of\nbreathing into the fingertip.\nIn energy practice you go by the \"feel\" and \"taste\", fully engaged and involved into it without discursive\nthoughts, the whole movement learning itself from moment to moment. But if you analyse, you will see\nthe process of deconstructions - the chest, the air movement, the stomach, the tailbone, the tightening of\nthe muscles of your abdomen, the holding of your breath at your lung … how you can deconstruct these\ninto the seamless activity of breathing into your finger tip. If you go through the process of\ndeconstruction, you too can get into the direct taste of maha and total exertion but it involves the\nconceptual mind until all these different events and related activity are deconstructed into a seamless\nflow. Though it involves the conceptual mind, your intellect is clear and knows exactly where the\nhindrances are… why the breath cannot flow smoothly …\nSo when I asked you can you breathe in slowly and deeply for those simple poses… you told me you think\nso... Immediately I know there is still a long way for you to go… lol”\n.....\nAs Vineeto (who has become almost like a successor or Richard at the moment, being the first fully free\nperson besides Richard himself, and I think is currently living with Richard) wrote:\nVINEETO: Yes, the definite moment of becoming fully free happened on October 12, 2010.\nAnd yes, \"the experiences and investigation around those interactions constituted the bulk of the ‘many\nmore things’.\"\nTo refresh my memory I checked what I wrote to Tarin in November 2010 about this period after the\nabdication of the guardian –\n[Vineeto]: Frequent interactions with Richard quite often resulted in glimpses of a greater depth to an\nactual freedom and at the time I called them windows into purity. Both Richard and I had noticed that\nwhen I described how I experienced myself, words such as the ‘immaculate purity’ and ‘pristine\nlimpidness’ where not part of my vocabulary and, except for a few occasional glimpses, neither did I\nmention in my description experiencing the infinitude of this spatially infinite, temporally eternal and\nperpetually forming and changing universe, whereas Richard has described his experience of an actual\nfreedom in such glowing terms like in one of my favourite excerpts from his journal –\n[Richard]: \"There is something precious in living itself. Something beyond compare. Something more\nvaluable than any \"King’s ransom\". It is not rare gemstones; it is not singular works of art; it is not the\n994\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nmuch-prized bags of money; it is not the treasured loving relationships; it is not the highly esteemed\nBlissful States Of ‘Being’ ... ... it is not any of these things usually considered precious. There is something\nultimately precious. It is the essential character of the infinitude of the universe … which is the life-giving\nfoundation of all that is apparent. That something precious is me as-I-am ... me as I actually am as distinct\nfrom ‘me’ as ‘I’ really am. I am the universe’s experience of itself. The limpid and lucid perfection and\npurity of being here now, as-I-am, is akin to the crystalline perfection and purity seen in a dew-drop\nhanging from the tip of a leaf in the early-morning sunshine; the sunrise strikes the transparent dew-drop\nwith its warming rays, highlighting the flawless correctness of the tear-drop shape with its bellied form.\nOne is left almost breathless with wonder at the immaculate simplicity so exemplified ... and everyone I\nhave spoken with has experienced this impeccable purity and perfection in some way or another at\nvarying stages in their life. Is it not impossible to conceive – and just too difficult to imagine – that this is\none’s essential character? One has to be daring enough to live it ... for it is both one’s audacious birth-\nright and adventurous destiny.\nWhen one lives the magical perfection of this purity twenty-four-hours-a-day; when one has ceased being\n‘I’ and is being genuine, one can see clearly that there is no separation between me and that something\nwhich is precious. The purity of life emerges from the perfection that wells up constantly due to an\nimmense stillness which is utterly immense in its scope and magnitude. This stillness of infinitude is that\nsomething which is precious. It is the life-giving foundation of all that is apparent. This stillness happens\nas me. This stillness is my essential disposition, for it is the principle character, the intrinsic basis of\neverything. It is this universe at its genesis. It is not, as it might commonly be supposed, at the centre of\neverything ... there is no centre here. This stillness, which is everywhere all at once, is the be all and end\nall of life itself. I am the universe experiencing itself as a sensate, reflective human being.\" Richard’s\nJournal, 1997, Article Twenty-five\nIn the early months of this year [2010] I had plenty of opportunity to read Richard’s words describing the\noutstanding quality of an actual freedom while I was updating the website, replacing all footnotes with\nthe new format of tool-tips and I became starkly aware of the vast gap of experiencing between his\ndescriptions and my own experience of myself and the world around me.\"\nAfter the abdication of the guardian I was one day ready to allow myself to fully (and permanently)\nexperience the spatial infinitude of the universe. Here is the description of what happened –\n[Vineeto]: \"The next significant event happened a week after my completion [the abdication of the\nguardian]. It began with an eerie sensation in the head as if my brain was being operated on whilst being\nfully conscious. After about 15 minutes or so there was a sensation as if my brain was being scattered\nthroughout the universe. When I recovered from the experience itself enough to find out what actually\nhappened, I noticed that I had lost my centre of reference (a discovery that left me quite disconcerted for\nabout 2 weeks). Richard reported that in the days before he was able to existentially sense me as being\nclose, very close, right in front of his eyes, so to speak, but that after this event he has been no longer able\n995\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nto sense me existentially. The direct result of losing the boundaries of my localized reference during this\n‘brain-scattering’ event is that I am permanently apperceptively aware of the infinitude of the universe as\ninfinite space, eternal time and perpetual matter.\" Private letter to Tarin, November 29, 2010\nI remember a similar profound disorientation (for a short period of time) after allowing to fully\nunderstand and experience the temporal infinitude of the universe.\nSo, lots of adventures and discoveries are still to come after becoming newly free.\" - Soh, 2019\n“Now it’s very clear that the whole universe is the total exertion of all conditions in spatial and temporal\ninfinitude.. each activity is the exertion of all the conditions in ten directions and three times.” - Soh, 2019\n“There are few conditions to experience maha as a ground [state] (Soh: means effortlessly experienced in all\nsituations as always already so)\n1. Mature in non-dual experience\n2. DO (dependent origination)\n3. Experience and understand that 'interconnectedness' is the universe itself\nThen 'self' and even non dual becomes quite irrelevant. In fact now presence is not understand as non-\ndual to me, but as dependent origination, where non-dual is already included” - John Tan, 2009\nIf Maha Total Exertion (+A) has become a ground state, effortlessly so and clear, you have to ask yourself\nis the taste of -A present?\n“Yes and very good. There is a very big difference between substantialist non-dual of One-Mind and what\nyou said. In this experience, there is no background reality. It is not about the background Awareness but\nrather the foreground aggregates that you are talking about - A thought. There is just aggregates that are\nlike foams, bubbles, ethereal having all the same taste without substantiality and implicitly non-dual. No\nsense of body, mind and the world, nothing actual or truly there.\nBefore, when insight of anatta first arose, you still risk the danger of seeing the physical as inherent and\ntruly existing. Therefore there is a period that you are lost, unsure and AF (Actual Freedom) seems\nappealing - a sign that you have not extended the insight of emptiness to phenomena though you kept\nsaying twofold emptiness.\nAt present you focus on the following:\n1. When there is no cold or heat (Soh: See glossary at the bottom of the article)\n2. Total exertion\n996\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nFor 1, it is not difficult to understand now but for 2, you have not directly or adequately replace the 'Self/self'\nwith the interdependence of whatever arises.” - John Tan, 06/12/2011 E-mail\n~ The Practice of No Cold or Heat vs Total Exertion\n“What you lack now is feel with the entire body mind until body-mind is entirely forgotten, deconstructed\nand enter into total exertion all things. There is neither you, body, mind, environment nor super awareness...\njust fully open up and experience the Beauty of this total exertion of suchness non dually. No body, mind,\nself can still remain at pure awareness level. The measurement is to total giving up so that the experience\nof how immensely is this web of interpenetration is experienced as this moment of arising is important.\nYou need to practice with the view in mind to see the interconnection, not non-conceptuality of whatever\narises.\nThere are two practices, one is feel the intensity of this moment of arise till there is no mind, body, self…\ndirectly right into the place where there is no heat or cold, the intensity of our luminous essence. The other\nis holding the view in mind till body, mind, self, universe is being deconstructed in this immense\ninterconnectedness. They are different, yet both practices are equally important. One is total non\nconceptuality, one is full integration of the view interconnectedness. In non conceptuality of in hearing, just\nsound...there is no mind, no self, no hearer, just this sound. This universe is filled with the arising sound...\nClear vivid and non-dual... you practice the intensity of luminous essence. But hearing sound, deep in you,\nyou see the empty nature of arise, you see the stick, the drum, the eardrums, the sound ... This requires\nview... And not non conceptuality. If you continue to see this perpetually, then the mind, body, universe\nconstruct will also be dissolved and experience turn maha and dimensionless. Get it?”\n\"Without concepts, experience is naturally present and luminous is not exactly true imo.\nWe can stop conceptualization or even have many episodes of sustained non-conceptual non-dual or no\nmind experiences, still intellectual obscurations of seeing entities, entity possessing characteristics, cause\nand effect, agent and movement... etc continue to haunt us. Non-analytical cessation is temporary.\nSo the freedom from conceptualization cannot simply be a stopping of \"conceptualization\", a clear insight\nthat sees through the emptiness of conventional constructs must arise.\nAlthough the insight results in non-conceptuality, it also recognizes the cause of obstructedness is\nignorance that obscures and blinds, not designations and constructs.\nWhen contemplating DO (though conceptual), not only does the sense of self not arise, it replaces self view.\nNon-conceptual resting is too a means to an end. The end is not a non-conceptual luminous state but the\ncomplete uprooting of ignorance.\n997\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nTherefore when Dogen rolls the boat in total exertion, there are concepts, designations and conventions\nbut there is no sense of self, no sense of boundaries, no sense of obstructedness between the sky, the boat,\nthe oar and the sea...all inter-penetrate beyond their conventional boundaries into the act of rolling.\" – John\nTan, 2020\nView must be fully integrated into your practice for you to understand what the maha experience is. Many\ndo not understand the implication of right view yet. You do not go non conceptual and realize the maha\nexperience of suchness.\nIt also requires to penetrate into DO by deeper investigation of the nature of experience. Where does sound\ngo? Is there a \"going, coming\", is there a \"here and there\" of sound, is there a voidness where sound return\nto? Then what does it mean by \"no going anywhere\" and seeing DO. Then we begin to understand the view\nof activities and actions and when we see everywhere the seamless integration and total exertions, then\nmaha experience will become more and more obvious and effortless. At this phase there is no self, no\ndual... All these are already implied... They are the content of emptiness.\nYou should look at few aspects:\n1. Seeing inherent object as a mere convention collating... If a practitioner keeps penetrating whatever\narises this way, experience will turn groundless and illusion–like\n2. Seeing clearly in non dual mode but deep in us realize that this is merely a dependent originated\nmanifestation, nothing ultimate and solidly real\n3. You see \"no going, no coming, no here, no there\" and penetrate deeply into the seamless\ninterpenetration of activities leading to the maha experience\nUntil this empty nature of whatever arises is intuited in our moment to moment of experience, you can\nthen feel the total exertion and self liberating aspect of experience.” - John Tan, 2012\n~ Non-Arisen Nature of Phenomena (-A)\nThis is not a matter of deconstructing physicality, objectivity, external universe, mind and body, etc.\n“I am referring to complete deconstruction into Primordial Purity as emptiness (-A).” – John Tan\n“Can the entire non-dual non conceptual experience be treated like AN IMPUTATION and emptiness and\nnon-arising is directly tasted as its nature? This is different from deconstructing ‘physicality’.” - John Tan,\n2013\nNote: the above two quotations seem to be a contradiction but it is not, as it refers to two complementary\naspects to the insight of emptiness, related to the freedom from elaboration and lack of self-nature as\n998\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nemptiness. See this article for more details: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2022/08/freedom-from-\nall-elaborations-and.html Freedom from All Elaborations and Freedom from Self-Nature\n“Yes, I think should add together as they represent the 2 different view of emptiness.\nFreedom from all elaborations and freedom from self-nature.\nYeah I included the two. One is freedom from all elaboration, one is spacious dream-like nature, lack of\nself-nature as emptiness.” - John Tan 2022\n(-A)\n30 years of practice and 23 years of kitchen life is like a passing thought.\nHow heavy is this thought?\nThe whereabouts of this thought?\nTaste the nature of this thought.\nIt never truly arises.\n- John Tan, 2013\n“If we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it arise, what is ‘thought’ like. 'Thought'\nwill reveal its nature is empty -- vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very important not to infer,\nthink or conceptualise but feel with our entire being this ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It seems to\nreside 'somewhere' but there is no way to locate it. It is just an impression of somewhere \"there\" but never\n\"there\". Similarly “here-ness” and “now-ness” are merely impressions formed by sensations, aggregates of\ncauses and conditions, nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like ‘selfness’.\nThis ungraspable and unlocatable empty nature is not only peculiar to ‘thought’. All experiences or\nsensations are like that -- vividly present yet insubstantial, un-graspable, spontaneous, un-locatable.\nIf we were to observe a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front us, the “redness” only appears to\n“belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species (dogs cannot\nperceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to\nlook into the atomic structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost\ncomplete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen,\nand hence is empty of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely\nluminous yet empty, mere appearances without inherent/objective existence.\nLikewise when standing in front of a burning fire pit, the entire phenomena of ‘fire’, the burning heat, the\nwhole sensation of ‘hotness’ that are so vividly present and seem so real but when examined they are also\nnot inherently “there” -- merely dependently manifest whenever conditions are there. It is amazing how\ndualistic and inherent views have caged seamless experience in a who-where-when construct.\n999\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAll experiences are empty. They are like sky flowers, like painting on the surface of a pond. There is no way\nto point to a moment of experience and say this is ‘in’ and that is ‘out’. All ‘in’ are as ‘out’; to awareness\nseamless experience is all there is. It is not the mirror or pond that is important but that process of illusion-\nlike phenomenon of the paint shimmering on the surface of the pond; like an illusion but not an illusion,\nlike a dream but not a dream. This is the ground of all experiences.\nYet this ‘ungraspability and unlocatabilty’ nature is not all there is; there is also this Maha, this great without\nboundaries feeling of 'interconnectedness'. When someone hits a bell, the person, the stick, the bell, the\nvibration of the air, the ears and then the magically appearance of sound -- ’Tongsss…re-sounding…’ is all a\nseamless one happening, one experience. When breathing, it is just this one whole entire breath; it is all\ncauses and conditions coming together to give rise to this entire sensation of breath as if the whole of\nuniverse is doing this breathing. The significance of this Maha experience is not in words; in my opinion,\nwithout this experience, there is no true experience of 'interconnectedness' and non-dual presence is\nincomplete.\nThe experience of our empty nature is a very different from that of non-dual oneness. ‘Distance’ for\nexample is overcome in non-dual oneness by seeing through the illusory aspect of subject/object division\nand resulted in a one non-dual presence. It is seeing all as just ‘This’ but experiencing Emptiness breaks the\nboundary through its empty ungraspable and unlocatable nature.\nThere is no need for a ‘where-place' or a ‘when-time' or a ‘who-I' when we penetrate deeply into this nature.\nWhen hearing sound, sound is neither ‘in here’ nor ‘out there’, it is where it is and gone! All centers and\nreference points dissolve with the wisdom that manifestation dependently originates and hence empty.\nThe experience creates an \"always right wherever and whenever is\" sensation. A sensation of home\neverywhere though nowhere can be called home. Experiencing the emptiness nature of presence, a sincere\npractitioner becomes clear that indeed the non-dual presence is leaving a subtle mark; seeing its nature as\nempty, the last mark that solidifies experiences dissolves. It feels cool because presence is made more\npresent and effortless. We then move from \"vivid non-dual presence\" into \"though vividly and non-dually\npresent, it is nothing real, empty!\".” - John Tan, 2009\n“Snap your fingers, hear the sound.\nClearly heard but where?\nTouch anything, feel them, feel the sensations dancing in zero dimension. Unlocatable, ungraspable.\nLook around, look at the radiance of the color.\nSo undoubtedly \"external\" yet they are as \"internal\"!\nLook at the scenery, clear, lurid and vivid.\n1000\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBut where? Outside? Inside?\nIn Soh's mind? In dog's mind, in everyone's mind?\nTotally present yet absence!\nAll experiences are like that, like magic, like illusion.\nSo why look into space?\nLook directly into the nature of experience.\nNeither external nor internal,\nNeither present nor absence,\nNeither come nor go.\nUnobstructable by being not here!\nIndestructible by being unreal!” - John Tan, 2019\n“Not bad however not exactly \"natural state\" yet but it is the beginning of the direct insight into \"natural\nstate\". To be fully \"natural\" and \"spontaneous\", both self and phenomena, arising and ceasing must all be\nde-constructed thoroughly.\nWhen sitting, there is no \"body\" and \"no one\" sitting. Only the sensation dancing. The \"butt\" that touches\nthe \"floor\" forms the sensation of \"hardness and firmness\" -- the earth element.\nNow, don't think but feel the sensation of \"hardness and firmness\", feel the earth element in anatta; so\nvividly and solidly present, now ask: where are all these sensations? So solidly and undeniably \"appears\"\nbut \"where\"?\nHappy anatta during CNY! ”\n- John Tan to someone who just realized anatta in 2021\n~ The Integration of Maha Total Exertion (+A) and Non-Arisen Nature of Phenomena (-A)\n“At some point, after getting familiarized with the realization and experience of +A and -A, during meditation\nor practice the experiential taste suddenly syncs into one. That is, the taste of total exertion where a given\nphenomenon is a seamless exertion with all other interconnected phenomenon, and the non-arising,\nillusory nature of presencing syncs into one.\nDependent arising thus non-arising, non-arising thus dependent arising.\nThis is to see the unity of the two truths from the perspective of experiential insight.\n1001\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWhen this is, that is. Neither this nor that arises. Dharma is - illusory, unborn, indestructible, and seamlessly\nconnected, great and boundless activity.”\n- Soh, 2019\n“Yes Angelo, total exertion!\nI like your description of walking down a lighted hallway.\nLike while walking in a shopping mall, there is no self, just the full fluxing sensations forming the the\nappearance of the “shopping mall”. Then when entering the car park, the entire fluxing sensations turn into\na “carpark”. The taste of this wondrous fluxing appearance is beyond description.\nAs for physicality and senses, they are simply conventional designations. In total exertion, all designated\nboundaries dissolved and the six senses seamlessly inter-permeate each other into one miraculous\nfunctioning. In the exertion of seeing for example, it is not only the eyes see; the ears see; the nose sees,\nthe colors see. The entire body-mind-universe marvelously arise as this moment of vivid scenery. In this\nmoment, there is no seer and no seeing, just the beautiful scenery.\nLook, appreciate and dwell deeply into it in non-dual and ask,\nWhere is this scenery?\nUnlike sound, taste, thoughts and smell that vanish like evanescent mist, the scenery is vividly and obviously\nthere, but where is it?\nPowerfully present, yet empty like reflection.\nIntegrate the two taste and happy journey!”\n- John Tan, 2019 (See: Angelo Gerangelo's Writings on Anatta and Total Exertion)\nIf either -A or +A is missing, one is still far from full integration. Many years ago, John Tan told Soh, “Your\nwritings are all full of illusions and -A. Missed all the +A. This forfeits the whole purpose of opening the\nheart and the ear… ...The moment is not only ungraspable and empty (-A), but alive and powerful, fully\nconnected and intimate with all things and all times (+A). That moment when the self is gone, everything\nalso becomes intimately connected.”\n“Dependent Formation, No Coming and Going, Release\n1002\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nJust like a movie, appearances are dependently originating as formation like burning flames and bubbles\nwithout anything coming or going, completely essenceless. Appearances are completely empty and non\narising by nature. Seeing this alone liberates. There is no persisting Essence or self/Self anywhere, only\ndependent formations. Nothing is there, void of substance yet appearing like flames and bubbles. As with\na movie, any sense of something or someone coming from here or going there is wrong. It is because we\nfail to see the nature of dharma (phenomena) as dependent formation that we conceive of phenomena as\nhaving essences, as having a life of their own, that could come and go, arise, abide and cease on its own.\nHas the burning flame came from somewhere, arise, abide, and cease, or is merely an empty dependent\nformation? You may not attribute some essence to characters in the movie coming from somewhere and\ngoing somewhere, but you attribute this to things and persons in “real life”. Rather see that all phenomena\nare like burning flame or bubble that manifest on conditions and cease upon cessation or conditions but\nwithout anything coming or going, arising or ceasing. If you try to find where they abide, where they go and\ncome from, nothing whatsoever can be found. Appearing but nothing “there”.\nDo you say the flame has some Essence that has gone somewhere else when ceased? Do you say some\nEssence has arrived from somewhere when fire starts burning? No, just dependent formations. All afflictive\nand non afflictive phenomena roll on in dependence without a persisting essence, agent, or medium. Yet\nbased on yesterday’s events, certain thoughts or actions take place today, as the continuity of the chain of\ndependencies. Still it is dependent formation, no self/Self involved.\nClinging and afflictions subside in actualizing this as there cannot be any sort of grasping at what is\ncompletely without Essence or self-existence. But this liberation does not come from the illusion-like\nexperience but from the complete release of any notion of Essence.. the taste is illusion like but it is the\nrelease of Essence that is liberating. Just like it is not the experience of PCE/pure consciousness experience\nor a state of no-mind (which can simply be peak experiences) that liberates but the release of self/Self from\nrealization of anatta that is liberating.\nSeeing this requires us to see the right relationship between experience, view and realization, and not\nskewing to one aspect.” - Soh, 2019\nOn the illusion-like taste of phenomena, it has been given many analogies by various Buddhist masters\nstarting from Buddha himself (see: Phena Sutta for instance).\n“Seeing everything like space, like a magical illusion,\nNeither meditating nor not meditating,\nNeither separate nor not separate:\nSuch is the Yogin's realization”\n~ Maitripa's Concise Summary of Mahamudra\n1003\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“Form is like a glob of foam;\nfeeling, a bubble;\nperception, a mirage;\nfabrications, a banana tree;\nconsciousness, a magic trick—\nthis has been taught\nby the Kinsman of the Sun.1\nHowever you observe them,\nappropriately examine them,\nthey’re empty, void\nto whoever sees them\nappropriately.\nBeginning with the body\nas taught by the One\nwith profound discernment:\nWhen abandoned by three things\n—life, warmth, & consciousness—\nform is rejected, cast aside.\nWhen bereft of these\nit lies thrown away,\nsenseless,\na meal for others.\nThat’s the way it goes:\nIt’s a magic trick,\nan idiot’s babbling.\nIt’s said to be\na murderer.2\nNo substance here\nis found.\nThus a monk, persistence aroused,\nshould view the aggregates\nby day & by night,\nmindful,\nalert;\nshould discard all fetters;\nshould make himself\nhis own refuge;\nshould live as if\nhis head were on fire—\nin hopes of the state\n1004\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nwith no falling away.”\n- Phena Sutta, https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN22_95.html\nAll conditioned phenomena\nAre like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows,\nLike dew and like lightning;\nOne should contemplate them in this way.\n- Diamond Sutra https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/06/the-diamond-of-perfect-wisdom-\nsutra.html\n“In the Udānavarga 2.18 it is clear the Buddha is addressing the nature of external phenomena:\nHe who has perceived that this body is (empty) as a vase, and who knows that all things (dharma) are as an\nillusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.

Dream: like a dream, objects perceived with the five senses are not there, but they appear\nthrough delusion\n2. Magical illusion: like a magic illusion, things are made to appear due to the temporary coming\ntogether of causes and conditions\n3. Hallucination or trompe-l'oeil: like a hallucination, things appear, yet there is nothing there\n4. Mirage: like a mirage, things appear, but they are not real\n5. Echo: like an echo, things can be perceived, but there is nothing there, either inside or outside\n6. City of gandharvas: like a city of gandharvas, there is neither a dwelling nor anyone to dwell\n7. Reflection: like a reflection, things appear, but have no reality of their own\n8.

However you contemplate\nthem, examining them carefully, they’re void and hollow when you look at them closely. Concerning this\nbody, he of vast wisdom has taught that when three things are given up, you’ll see this form discarded.\nVitality, warmth, and consciousness: when they leave the body, it lies there tossed aside, food for others,\nmindless.\n1006\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSuch is this process, this illusion, cooed over by fools. It’s said to be a killer, for no substance is found\nhere. An energetic mendicant should examine the aggregates like this, with situational awareness and\nmindfulness whether by day or by night.\nThey should give up all fetters, and make a refuge for themselves. They should live as though their head\nwas on fire, aspiring to the imperishable state.\nAnother from Udānavarga 2.18:\nHe who has perceived that this body is (empty) as a vase, and who knows that all things (dharma) are as\nan illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.\nHe who has perceived that this world is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does\nthus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death. He who has\nperceived that this body is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy\nthe chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.\nAnother, SA 265:\nMonks, it is just as if a master magician or the disciple of a master magician at a crossroads creates the\nmagical illusion of an elephant troop, a horse troop, a chariot troop, and an infantry troop, and a clear-\nsighted person carefully examines, attends to, and analyses it. At the time of carefully examining,\nattending to, and analysing it, he finds that there is nothing in it, nothing stable, nothing substantial, it has\nno solidity. Why is that? It is because there is nothing solid or substantial in a magical illusion.\nSome Mahāyāna examples, in the Bhadramāyākāra Sūtra, it is said:\nMaudgalyāyana, moreover, since the illusions of Bhadra the Magician are partial, his illusions are not true;\nbut the illusions of the Tathāgata are true, therefore, all phenomena are fully realized to be illusory.\nThe Samādhirāja states:\nAll existence is like an illusion, powerless, like foam that gathers and becomes hollow.\nAnd,\nThe primal nature of phenomena is empty, like an illusion, which tirthikas are unable to know.\nUnderstanding all phenomena to be similar to illusions, is not the domain of signs.\nThe Ārya-lalitavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra says:\nBecause of dwelling in the equivalence of all phenomena with illusions, mirages, dreams, water moons,\nechoes and double vision, the Dharma free of affliction is perfectly realized.\nThe Ārya-mañjuśrīvikurvāṇaparivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:\n1007\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nFurther, sister, the five aggregates are illusory. They do not exist. There is no arising of erroneous action.\nIt is conventionally designated through an error. Sister, awakening is like an illusion, it does not exist, it is\nconventionally designated through an error. Sister, though awakening is like an illusion, it does not exist,\nit is conventionally designated through an error. Therefore, sister, because illusions are the same, the\naggregates are the same. Because the aggregates are the same, illusion is the same. Since illusion is the\nsame, awakening is the same. Since awakening is the same, illusion is the same. Sister, therefore, I call\nyou \"awakened\".\nThe Ārya-ghanavyūha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra says:\nThe suchness of all phenomena arises through power of mutual relation, the yogins seeing in that way\nclearly see it as suchness. The perfected nature is the dharmatā of phenomena; all phenomena do not\narise as the substantial entities of the imputed: empty, insubstantial, beyond the extremes of existence\nand nonexistence, similar with illusions and dreams, like fairy castles, like opthalmia and like mirages.\nThe Acintyastavaḥ says:\nLike a dream, an illusion, [or] seeing two moons: Thus have You [The Buddha] seen the world, as a\ncreation not created as real. Like a son who is born, established, and dies in a dream, the world, You have\nsaid, is not really born, does not endure, and is not destroyed... According to cognition of truth,\n[however], You maintain that there is no annihilation or permanence. [You] assert that the entire world is\nempty of substance, like a mirage.\nThe Lokātītastava states:\nYou [The Buddha] have stated that all arising is like the arising of an illusion. Therefore You have fully\nunderstood that this world has arisen due to imagination. It is unreal, [and] not having originated it\ncannot be destroyed.\nThe Mahāyānaviṁśikā:\nThe object of knowledge in dream is not seen when one awakes. Similarly the world disappears to him\nwho is awakened from the darkness of ignorance. The creation of illusion is nothing but illusion. When\neverything is compound there is nothing which can be regarded as a real thing. Such is the nature of all\nthings. As the figments of a dream dissolve upon waking, so the confusion of Samsara fades away in\nenlightenment.\n——-\nInteresting that people are upvoting u/Sneezlebee’s inaccurate answer that “the Buddha never said\nphysical reality itself is an illusion.”\nAnd OP finds that “reassuring.” No offense but that inclination to seek a secure refuge or landing place\nshould be thoroughly investigated. That is how deep our conditioning is.\nLike the Ḍākārṇava Tantra says:\n1008\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nEveryone is confused by illusion; but the wise are liberated by illusion.\nSeeing that this world - this so-called “physical reality” - is an illusion, is the doorway to liberation. Reifying\nthis illusory reality as stable and real (vāstu) will seed the causes for the continual cycle of suffering.\nThere are two obscurations that prevent us from attaining buddhahood. These two obscurations must be\neliminated to attain buddhahood. The first, the afflictive obscuration, is the perception of a self. The\nsecond, the cognitive obscuration, is the perception of an real external physical reality. Buddhas have\neliminated both of these obscurations, they do not perceive a physical reality.\nFrom Rongzom:\nMoreover, the way [a buddha] knows and sees is not like holding [entities] to be substantial. He knows\nand sees [them] as an illusion. Likewise, the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra states:\nFor example, some magicians attempt to free a magically created [being by removing its magical power].\nSince they already know [that it is an illusion], they face no obstructions to [correctly perceiving] that\nillusion-[like being]. Likewise, the wise, who are fully awakened, perceive the three [realms of] existence to\nbe illusion-like.\nAlso, in the Pitāputrasamāgamasūtra it is stated:\nBecause a magician knows the magical apparition created [by him] to be an illusion, he is not confused by\nit. You, [too,] see the entire world ('gro ba: jagat) in this way. [I] pay homage and praise to one who sees\neverything [in this way].\nFurther, some say: The fully awakened one possesses the knowledge of the absolute, [namely], the so-\ncalled gnosis of knowing [phenomena] as [they actually] are, but does not possess the knowledge of the\nconventional, the so-called gnosis of knowing [phenomena] to the full extent. It is not that something\nknowable (mkhyen rgyu yod pa) is not known [by a buddha]. But since conventional knowable\n[phenomena] are non-existent, there is no gnosis of perceiving them [either]. How is it that conventional\n[phenomena] are non-existent? Conventional [phenomena] appear to ordinary beings as they are,\nnamely, caused [in their case] by defiled ignorance (nyon mongs pa can gyi ma rig pa). They appear to the\nthree [types of] nobles (i.e., śrāvaka saints, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas) as they are, namely,\ncaused [in their case] by undefiled ignorance (nyon mongs pa can ma ying pa'i ma rig pa). It is, for\nexample, like the appearance of strands of hair and [other] 'floaters' (rab rib: timira) to a [person]\nsuffering from an eye disease. [Immediately] after the Diamond-like Samadhi [has arisen in him], a\nbuddha discards [even undefiled] ignorance, and sees true reality, in that [he] does not see any\nphenomena. Therefore, these deceptive conventional [phenomena] do not exist in a buddha['s field of\nperception].\nAlso, Sneezlebee’s assessment that “consciousness dreaming the body” is a “new age” view is really not\nthe case. This is implied in buddhadharma, and stated explicitly in some systems, the Khandro Nyinthig\nsays:\n1009\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nTo sum it all up, ignorant attachment to dualistic appearances assembles the rtsal of gnosis (jñāna -\npristine consciousness) into the [four material] elements, and forms the body in actuality.”\nLongchenpa: Finding Rest in Illusion\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\n· odpron9umh14tfuat740 ·\nImportant book recommendation for post anatta contemplation\nJohn Tan: This book you must read and keep for life.

Every aspect of the five objects,\nsuch as form, included in the phenomena of the world and beings, are mere appearances with no true\nexistence. All the appearances which have appeared to both the pure perceptions of the Buddhas and the\nimpure perceptions of deluded beings are the percepts of wisdom and the mind. While the appearances\nare appearing to both perceptions, they are appearing with no inherent existence (Rang-bZhin), like a\nreflection in a mirror and rainbow rays in the sky. To the pure perception of wisdom the (appearances)\ntranscend the extremes of existing and non-existing as there are no stains of apprehender and\napprehended. As there is no creating, ceasing, and changing, all are free from the characteristics of\ncompounded phenomena, the appearances of uncompounded emptiness-form, and are totally free from\nconceptualizations. To the perception of the deluded mind, (the appearances) merely appear as the\nobject of apprehension of self (bDag-'Dzin), which have fallen into the extreme (concepts) of existing or\nnon-existing, are detached from the characteristics of uncompounded (nature), and have strengthened\nthe habituations of adventitious and circumstantial self-perceptions. So, here, one will understand that\nthe objects, the delusory appearances of the mind, are unreal. Various external appearances, such as\n1013\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nwhite and red, are merely the percepts of rigid habits, like a dream created by the drunkenness of\nignorant sleep. There is not the slightest existence (in them) as the object in the (true) meaning. Also,\nthose appearances are not mind from the very point of their arising, because their substantial\ncharacteristics, such as color, size, and distinctions, negate the character of the mind. At the same time,\nthey are not other than the mind, because, in addition to their being merely the delusory perceptions (of\nthe mind), no other object has ever been established as such. The appearances to the mind are just types\nof experience of rigid habits continuing from beginningless time. It is like dreaming last night about a\nmagic show one has seen yesterday. Therefore, one should think that whatever appears are appearances\nof non existence, and are without foundation, abiding place, natural existence, and recognizable (entity).\nThey are merely a clear appearance of the empty nature like a dream, magical display, mirage, echo,\nshadowy view (Mig-Yor), water-moon (reflection), miracle, and the city of smell-eaters (a spirit world).\nWhatever appears, self or others, enemies or friends, countries or towns, places or houses, food or drink\nor wealth, and whatever one does, eating or sleeping, walking or sitting, one should train in seeing them\nas unreal. One should devote oneself to this training in all its aspects: the preliminary, actual, and\nconcluding practices.\n(ii) The objects, if analyzed, are emptiness. If the appearances are examined from gross to subtle down to\natoms, they are partless and non-existent. So form is emptiness. (Likewise,) by examining color and\nrecognition of sound, it (will be found to be) emptiness. By examining the form and essence of smell, it\n(will be found to be) emptiness. By examining the aspects of taste, they (will be found to be) emptiness.\nEspecially, by examining the sources (sense-objects), the emptiness of touch will be reached. Although\nthey are different in appearance, they are the same in their nature in being emptiness, so the emptiness\nof various objects are not separate categories. Their nature, like pure space, transcends being either\nseparate or the same. So the nature of objective appearances is emptiness in its essence.\nThe Apprehender Has No Foundation and No Root\n(i) The consciousnesses are self-clarity without foundation.\n(There are eight consciousnesses.) The five sense-consciousnesses; arise as the five objects such as form,\nthe mind-consciousness cognizes the general impression (of the appearing objects) and designates them\nas the objects, the defiled mind-consciousness is the sense of negating, accepting, hating and disliking\n(etc.), the mind-consciousness arises after the six consciousnesses (five senses and universal ground\nconsciousness), ...and the consciousness of universal ground is self-clarity (Rang-gSal) and no thought and\nis unrelated to the objects: these are the eight or six consciousnesses. At the (very) time of (functioning of\nany of) those consciousnesses themselves, whatever consciousness it is, it is clear, vivid, and self-clarity\nwith no foundations. Although they appear clear, there is no substantial entity. They are appearing\nwithout existence, like clear space and a breeze with no dust. Their clarity is present naturally like the sky\nwithout clouds. Their movements are like wind, not in distinguishable substances. From the (very) time of\nappearing, (the consciousnesses) as the apprehenders are self-clarity and unrecognizable. Watch them\nwhen they are arising and when they are abiding. Relax naturally and watch the manner of appearing of\nthe apprehender. Thereby one will realize the apprehenders as having the nature of merely an\nappearance of clarity with no existence, emptiness with no bias, and self-clarity with no foundation.\n(ii) (The subject), if analyzed, is emptiness without root.\n1014\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBy analyzing (whether) the self-clear, baseless mind (exists) in the external appearances, inner physical\nbody, or intermediate movements, or if the entity of the self-dwelling mind itself (can be) recognized in\n(its) design, color, birth, cessation, and abiding, one will realize that its nature is non-existence, baseless\nand free from the extremes of either existence or non-existence. In this training the devotion to the Lama\nis the only important thing.\nLabels: Books and Websites Recommendations, Dzogchen, Longchenpa 0 comments | |”\nSomeone said all one has to do is contemplate on the illusoriness of phenomena and one realizes\nemptiness, but John Tan disagreed and said\n“5/21/2012 12:37 PM: John: Not exactly...that is experience...what is important is to realize what the\nYouTube about h2o (https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=Q80MfH7xPPE) then the willingness to\ndrop the inherent view becomes natural.

But get the view right.”\nEmptiness as Non-Conceptuality\nIt must be understood that Emptiness is not the same as “dry non-conceptuality”, which we define as merely\na state of the suspension of conceptual thinking. This is often the practice after a practitioner has a direct\ntaste of the luminous Presence, or non-dual awareness. The tendency will be to drop all thoughts to rest in\na state of naked awareness. However, this is not the same as the non-conceptuality of emptiness.\nEmptiness is non-conceptuality, but this refers to the emptying of false concepts from penetrative wisdom\ninto the twofold emptiness of self and phenomena.\nIt should be noted that when “the disease of non-conceptuality” is spoken earlier in this document, it is\nreferring to the aspect of coarse conceptual thinking and labelling. It is possible for example to suspend\ncoarse conceptual thoughts and still perception is divided into a subject and object, in fact, one may\nexperience oneself as a separate Witness of thoughts and perceptions. Or, even in a non-dual state, one\ncan still reify an ultimate nondual subjectivity, or the objectivity of PCE.\nAs John Tan wrote, “The lingo is different. Like I said, for us non-conceptuality is not non-dual [and] is not\nnon-inherent. For the Tibetan masters, conceptual construct implies duality and inherency and labeling.”\n1015\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“In the Bodhicittavivarana (may not be a text from the same Nagarjuna who composed\nMulamadhyamakakarika - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna#Works), Nagarjuna explains\nemptiness to be the absence of conceptualization.” - Soh\n“I think most Tibetan Masters understand that way [emptiness as the absence of conceptualization]” - John\nTan\n“When Tibetans use the word conceptual, it means dualistic, it means characteristics, it means inherent, it\nmeans names and labels” - John Tan\n“[conceptuality] refers to perceived, perceiver, characteristics and origination, substantive reality” – Soh\n“Actually the whole issue lies in how you understand mmk whether as:\n1. Freedom from self-nature\" or\n2. Freedom from elaborations/conceptualities\nSad to say if understood from 2 then one is only restricted to silence or mysticism beyond speech. If\nunderstood from 1, then it will include 2 (non-conceptual) as evident in ATR phases of insights, anatta into\nno-mind of pure empty appearance -A and total exertion of +A. This is because freedom from \"self nature\"\nwill trigger insights of non-locality, Intimacy, embodiedment and total participation as well. Why?\nBecause without self/essence? There can't be dual therefore non-dual and non-conceptual; there can't be\nlocality/time as well as seamless intimacy of everything.\nIf you contemplate deeply you will know.\nSoh: Even anatta insight is more of 1.. the 2 if divorced from 1 becomes disease of non conceptuality you\nwarned more than 10 years ago\nRight\nJohn Tan: Yes.” – Conversation in 2022\nConceptuality\nJohn Tan wrote:\nLing Yin One of the biggest issue about freedom from all elaborations/conceptualities is the idea of what\nthe Tibetan Buddhism meant by \"conceptualities\". They don't actually mean by what western thoughts or\nhow we commonly understand -- a symbolic layer over \"something\". It actually meant imputed\ndesignation that is closely linked to self-nature.\n1016\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSo when you hear \"conceptualities\" always link to self-nature. That is why whenever explanations are\nmade by Tibetan teachers, they always ended up explaining and relating to self-nature when they explain\n\"conceptualities\".\nEven Mipham or Longchenpa I realized they are actually talking about that. I just hope one day this can be\nmade clear by teachers as well as translators as it is extremely misleading to separate \"conceptualities\"\nfrom \"self-nature\" in these (Tibetan) teachings.\nLabels: Emptiness, Freedom from Elaborations 0 comments | |\n\"The process of eradicating avidyā (ignorance) is conceived… not as a mere stopping of thought, but as the\nactive realization of the opposite of what ignorance misconceives. Avidyā is not a mere absence of\nknowledge, but a specific misconception, and it must be removed by realization of its opposite. In this vein,\nTsongkhapa says that one cannot get rid of the misconception of 'inherent existence' merely by stopping\nconceptuality any more than one can get rid of the idea that there is a demon in a darkened cave merely\nby trying not to think about it.

I do not consider\ndeep karmic tendencies as \"conceptual\".\nFor the ineffable beyond speech, there is nothing that can be said as it is the termination of all words and\nthe way of leaping to that can be by koan or by way of negation and deconstruction.

Both will clear certain obscurations that are not easy to c.\nFor freedom of all elaborations is like insight of anatta extended to all phenomena where not only\nconceptual notion of self is deconstructed but also phenomena, events, cause and effect...etc. One comes\nface to face to primordial suchness (pure appearances). In order words, the full maturity of anatta\ntherefore it is most intuitive and direct to ATR people and why I like Mipham in the first place.\nBut I when I started studying Tsongkhapa I realized empty of self-nature is different. Both conceptual and\nnon-conceptual, imagined appearances and pure appearances share a single space-like taste of\nemptiness (essencelessness). Whereas for freedom from all elaborations, they are \"irreconcilable\".\nTherefore followers of Tsongkhapa, they will have no such issue about Andre first point (and there are\nother issues):\n\"It feels odd, right? How can conceptuality or lack thereof have anything to do with the way things arise or\nmanifest?\"\nY? Because it is precisely this essencelessness that manifestion is possible. It is because of corelessness\nthe dependent arising is possible.\nLike what I wrote to you and yin ling:\n1018\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nIn addition to having this taste, you may want to explore \"empty of self-nature\" from an experiential angle\nrather than analysis.\nBe in anatta and while in the bliss of non-dual, see how radically different is the music and the vivid\nscenery; how thought is markedly different from sensations and smell; how a \"shopping mall\" can\n\"transmute\" into a \"carpark\"?\nAsk urself how all these are even possible? So seamless and instantaneous is the \"morphing\", simply\nmiraculous!\nAsk urself again, how is this possible at all if there is essence? Let the insight of \"essencelessness\"\npermeates ur entire being and heal all ur clogged up energies.\nThen look at thoughts and conceptualities. See how malleable thoughts and conceptual ideas are and see\nhow they freely manifest. How are all these even possible if there is \"essence\"?\nNext look at dependent arising. How is it possible to even originate in dependence so seamlessly? Feel\nthe \"essencelessness\" and feel the \"magic\" and wonder. You must feel \"essencelessness\", not think\nessencelessness.\nThen you will understand the intent of Nagarjuna. There will be no arguments. You will realize that only\nbecause of \"essencelessness\" are all these possible. You will understand it is precisely that there is no\nself-nature, there is causal efficacies; because it is dream-like, there is all these vivid appearances and\nhappenings.\nAnyway that is just my opinion.\n[8:05 pm, 25/04/2022] John Tan: Don't go argue and over emphasize for each has their own path.\n[8:07 pm, 25/04/2022] John Tan: One is like horizontal breadth to all phenomena of anatta while the other\nis like vertical depth of anatta.\n-->>This can perhaps be summarized by saying that dependent arising and the 'aproximate ultimate'\n(emptiness as nisvabhava) are indeed synonymous (since they are conceptual equivalents), while the\nactual ultimate (emptiness as nisprapanca or 'freedom from elaborations') has no synonyms whatsoever,\nsince it is not a conceptual object at all.\nYes. Only spontaneous presence and natural perfection. There is not even knowingness or apprehension.\nLabels: Dependent Origination, Emptiness, John Tan, Mipham Rinpoche, Tsongkhapa |\n“The Reasoning of Dependent Arising\nThis is the reasoning analyzing all phenomena, the fourth of the four ways of realizing that the mind of\nself-awareness is without true existence. In this regard, it is said that the antidotes to ignorance are the 12\nbranches of dependent-arising. Naropa says:\n'Being an awareness,\nThe mind of self-awareness\nHas the nature of luminosity.\nBeing nonconceptual,\n1019\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nIt does not conceive of itself.'\nThe very nature of such a mind is non-conceptuality.\nLet us take, as an example, a person who has a mind of self-awareness which is an exalted wisdom. When\nthat person realizes that the mind is exalted wisdom, it is said that he or she ceases to look elsewhere for\nBuddha. However, the mind of self-awareness can be obstructed by temporary stains. The mind afflicted\nby conceptuality is like water, gold, and space, in this way: in their relative states, all these are subject to\ndistinctions of pure and impure, but their true nature is luminosity. In their true nature, even the slightest\nstain is utterly nonexistent.\nJust as outer phenomena do not exist, so inner phenomena do not exist; just as inner phenomena do not\nexist, so outer phenomena do not exist. It is said that sentient beings are not sentient beings; however, it\nis not the case that they do not exist. One must come to realize the ultimate nature free from the\nconventional nature.\nFurthermore, all phenomena, from forms through omniscient consciousnesses, are dependent-arisings;\ndependent-arisings are momentary phenomena; momentary phenomena are produced from conditions;\nthat which is produced from conditions is not produced inherently.\nAs the Buddha said:\n'That which is produced from conditions is not produced,\nBecause it is without inherent production.\nThat which depends on conditions is emptiness.\nOne who knows emptiness is aware.'\nThis is how one is to understand the true foundation of the mind. One who has such understanding is\nsaid to possess the realization that is not touched by the three great views*. There is no assertion*.\nAs Lord Jigten Sumgon says:\n'Finally, realize directly the Truth Body: such realization transcends the three great views; it is utterly free\nof viewing, object of view, and agent of view. This is a special feature of our system, not possessed by any\nother.'\nThose three great views are of course needed. But if you are not free from attachment to high status*,\nthen you will not realize the view; you will not get at the real view.\nThe real view is free of assertion.\nAs Lord Jigten Sumgon says:\n1020\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n'Since I have no assertion,\nI do not incur those faults.\nThe Conqueror said nothing to his disciples;\nThen he explained extensively\nThat which had been unsaid.'\nThus, the view must be accompanied by realization. Having realized the view, meditate on it.\n~ pg 77 - 79, Garland of Mahamudra Practices, translated by Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen Rinpoche and\nco-translated by Katherine Rogers\n===\n*The three great views:\nThe three great views are Madhyamika, Mahamudra, and the view known as Dzogchen in Tibetan.\n*There is no assertion:\nEach of the three great views explains phenomena and emptiness a little differently and therefore\ninvolves some assertion; and where there is assertion there is duality. With the faults of duality, the view\ncannot be realized --- that is, cannot be known unmistakenly and nonconceptually. The real view is\nwithout assertion. When one really realizes the true fact of the view of all phenomena, one can give it any\nname. In this system it is called mahamudra, but that is only a name, and the true nature is beyond all\nnames. It simply is, as fire is hot, and there is nothing to accept or reject.\n*Free from attachment to high status:\nA person attached to high status is one who would take pride, for example, in being Madhyamika, or in\nbeing a mahamudra practitioner. If you are not free from such pride, you cannot realize the ultimate\nview, which is free of assertion. One who does realize the view free of assertion is said to be untouched\nby any view; that is, untouched by any dualistic assertion.” - Garland of Mahamudra Practices by\nKhenchen Konchog Gyaltshen\n“Nāgārjuna is famous for arguing that his philosophy was not a view, and that he in fact did not take any\nposition (paksa) or thesis (pratijña) whatsoever since this would just be another form of clinging to some\nform of existence.[77][64] In his Vigrahavyavartani, Nāgārjuna states:\nIf I had any position, I thereby would be at fault. Since I have no position, I am not at fault at all. If there\nwere anything to be observed through direct perception and the other instances [of valid cognition], it\n1021\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nwould be something to be established or rejected. However, since no such thing exists, I cannot be\ncriticized.[78]\nLikewise in his Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning, Nāgārjuna says: \"By taking any standpoint whatsoever, you will\nbe snatched by the cunning snakes of the afflictions. Those whose minds have no standpoint, will not be\ncaught.\" [79] Randall Collins states that for Nāgārjuna, ultimate reality is simply the idea that \"no concepts\nare intelligible\", while Ferrer notes that Nagarjuna criticized those whose mind held any \"positions and\nbeliefs\", including the view of emptiness, as Nāgārjuna says: \"The Victorious Ones have announced that\nemptiness is the relinquishing of all views. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to\nbe incorrigible.\"[80][81] Aryadeva echoes this idea in his Four Hundred Verses:\n\"First, one puts an end to what is not meritorious. In the middle, one puts an end to identity. Later, one\nputs an end to all views. Those who understand this are skilled.\"[82]”\n“[5/3/19, 10:33:03 PM] Soh Wei Yu: it is freedom from conceptualization by seeing that growth and decay\nare not self-existent by its own side but but merely imputed.

Vedanta’s idea of world is illusory is not as penetrative.\nHow the mind reifies conventions in various ways on which self as a construct is most crucial imo.\nIf you start from phenomena and object, it may not be that obvious, direct and experiential.\n1022\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThen one has to really look into the dual purpose of how deconstruction takes place and why emptiness is\ntaught as in the chariot analogy. This part is not necessarily the intention of emptiness teaching but I find\nthat it can't be just a coincidence for it to be taught that way. Anyway it is an excellent semblance of\nappearance is like conceptually .\nThen you have to look into the depth of no agency.\nNo need to keep convincing ppl.\nRefine your understanding and experience. There are far deeper depths to explore.\nYou don't have to go too deep into madhyamaka but there are certain aspects you need to understand.\nThen you will clearly see that the entire purpose is to cease reifications and free one from extremes.\nHowever many can still land as affirmative negation. What you have to be clear is to understand the entire\npurpose is to see through conventionalities and free oneself from conceptualities naturally, not to affirm\nanything... their non-affirmative negation. Once the mind understand essence is just a view, mind can\nnever hold, then when one is introduced to presence, the understanding will be entirely different.\nI have told you many times there are 2 levels, one is mind level release and the other is presence. Both are\nequally important. In fact the mind level release and clear discernment of that level is very crucial.\nOtherwise you have all these I AM misconception everywhere.\nIf we do not understand the meaning of non-conceptualities properly, then we will end up [having] the non-\nconceptuality in I AM, one mind, dualistic mind...\nSo you must differentiate the non conceptualities that arise from seeing through reifications and the rest.\nIt is like heaven and earth sort of difference.\nSo both levels require the wisdom that sees through constructs, otherwise non-conceptuality is not the\nnon-conceptuality I am talk about and presence is the not presence I am talking about also.” – John Tan,\n2020\n“To me Experiencing an awareness without concept and gap between two moment of thought is not\nexperiencing emptiness. Experiencing the self-releasing of whatever arises directly is experiencing\nemptiness and awareness in this state is without ground, base, attachment, clear and luminous.\nDirectly experiencing the gap between two moment of thoughts do not require a practitioner to embrace\nthe \"view\" of emptiness.” – John Tan, 2011\n1023\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“Wonder why K sees \"things\" are only conceptual designations as an issue. In fact that is key to\nunderstanding prasangika madhyamaka and in fact only after insight of anatta can one fully accept this\nprofound insight. But it is not how Mr. J explains and understands.\nWe must accept that all are mere imputations but from the insight of anatta, not from the insight of\nsubstantialist view. \"Phenomena\" is understood differently from our general English usage, \"phenomenon\"\nin Buddhism in general is object possessing identifiable characteristic and therefore having essence that is\nfindable. However in Prasangika it is said that phenomena are merely names and imputations. But \"mere\"\nimputation in Prasangika cannot be understood apart from its dependencies. This dependency is key and\nis what dependent arising and emptiness are about.\nWhen Prasangika says that things or phenomena are just mere labels, names, designations or imputations,\nit is not as we understood in common English terminology, rather, it is to be understood from the\nperspective of dependent designations, not just designations. Without understanding this dependencies,\nwe are not understanding what is meant by \"mere designations\". That is, it is mere\nname/designation/imputation because the designated referent as an entity when sought can never be\nfound apart from its basis of designation. This basic understanding must be there and must go into our\ninmost mindstream. And only direct insight of anatta can understand the significance.\nTherefore the non-conceptuality is not simply non-conceptuality as in freedom from labeling but a freedom\nfrom the blinding spell of seeing things in terms of 4 extremes from reified designations. This extends to\nall phenomena be it conditioned or unconditioned phenomena. As for non-conceptuality, there are fierce\ndebates between Gorampa and Tsongkhapa. There is also Mipham's view of non-conceptuality but these\nmasters agree that the mode of non-conceptuality is a very specific and special mode of intuitive insight\nthat relates to freedom of extremes, not just imageless bare mode perception.” - John Tan, 2014\n“Malcolm wrote:\nApart from the Gelugpas, all Madhyamaka approaches, including Nāgārjuna's clearly underline the need\nto negate all four extremes in the ultimate, not merely one.\nBuddhaFollower wrote:\nNegation of all 4 extremes is done simply by understanding non-arising?\nIs that right?\nMalcolm:\nNo, not if you are an ordinary person. If you are an ordinary person, you must go through step by step\nand analyze all four extremes. Having ascertained through analysis that a phenomena existing through\nthe four extremes does exist in the relative, one then applies that analysis to the ultimate, finding that\nalso that there is nothing which can be found in the ultimate existing by way of the four extremes.

Not being affected and dissolve the grasping or\n2. Completely eliminates that layer of imputation/imagination/conceptualization or\n3. No longer see objectively independent reality out there. How does freedom relate to seeing through\n\"objectively independent reality\"?\n· Reply\n· 3d · Edited\n1029\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nMr. AA\nJohn Tan\n, you asked Mr. R, but let me explore it also.\nImputations are to be abandoned because they actively fabricate and distort experience, they add\nsymbolic and dualistic dimensions to the bare field of appearances. Conceptuality is a mere set of\nconventional meanings used for the sake of communication. However, in a realized mind, except for\nsheer communication, I'd say even concepts dissipate - there is no linguistic overlay established upon\nappearances. There's just the luminous insubstancial display. There is no notion of \"thingness\" and thus\nno subsequent notion of substance, function, name, etc.\nFirst the grasping dissolves, but as solidity and thingness are seen through, all imagination and\nconceptualization dissolve too. An antidote may initially be applied, but it too is eventually dropped.\nThe freedom that sees through \"objectively independent reality\" is freedom from a sense of separation,\nduality, constriction and limitation. Because \"a world out there\" necessarily implies \"a self in here\", and\nthat sense of embodiment (\"I am body\") and localization (\"I am here and not there or everywhere\") is\nconstricting and limiting. When seeing through solidity, duality and separation, an intimacy (no space) and\nimmediacy (no time) steps in, and experience is relieved both of internal splits (inner/outer,\nsubject/object, mind/matter) and external splits (this experience / the rest of the universe, this experience\n/ other experiences). No center, but also no edge.\n1\n· Reply\n· 2d\nJohn Tan\nYes André\n, I agree with most of what you said, just 3 points:\n1. Primordial state, original face.\nWhat does it mean to to be without the imagined and imputed? It is simply one's primordial state, always\nand already so despite non-recognition. So sometime the mental mind can't get around, it can't see the\nrelationship.\nSo the path can be directly pointing to one's original face or to rid from all imputed imagined artificialities.\nBut the direct leap out of the imputed layer is often not exhaustive and thorough, many blindspots and\nhindrances. Therefore a short cut can often turns out to be a longer cut.\n2. Unmade, natural and spontaneous\nI agree that without imputations, there is no boundaries. Therefore all experiences are open and spacious\nand without the layer of the imagined, whatever appears is pristine and pellucid, transparent and crystal.\nIn addition to that, purge of all imputed artificialities, whatever appears is also unmade and\nunconditioned, natural and spontaneous.\n3. Seeing through duality and seeing through inherency to me is not the same and has different\nexperiential tastes.\nWhen we say \"the lightning is flashing\", there are no two parts - \"lightning\" and \"flashing\", the flashing is\nthe lightning.\nWhen we say \"the mover and the movement\", there are no two parts - \"mover\" and \"movement\", the\nmover is the movement.\nSame for the anatta insight, hearer hearing sound. There are no 3 parts, no hearer hearing sound, the\nhearer is the hearing is the sound.\n1030\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThat is seeing through thingness, agency and action.\nBut seeing through duality like inner/outer, left/right, entry/exit, object/subject is different. When the line\nof demarcation that divides dissolved, experience turns non-dual but sense of \"thingness\" can still remain\nintact quite strongly imo.\nSo this teaching of exhausting \"thingness\" is quite unique, it is not just doing away with duality or\nconceptualities in bare attention or being naked in awareness or having pure conscious experience (pce).\nLast question:\nWhat if one does not go through the path of seeing through mental imputation and reification?\nAny other ways to free oneself from the sense of agency-action, duality and boundaries?\nGot to go, late for work. Thks for sharing!\n1\n· Reply\n· 2d · Edited\nMr. AA\nAny other ways..? I'm not sure. Contemplating conditionality perhaps? It's less conceptual and more\nexperiential.\nYes, seeing non-duality is not the same as seeing no-inherency. The former is more about seeing through\nthe characteristics of subject-object, while the latter seems to be more about seeing through all types of\ncharacteristics.\nWhat do you suggest to see through \"thingness\"? I may tend to fall into PCE's.\n1\n· Reply\n· 1d\nJohn Tan\nI think you have explored and are familiar with the different deconstruction methods and yes DO (general\ndependent origination) is an excellent tool for deconstruction. It deconstructs without ignoring diversities.\nIn DO, one feels the deep intimacy and connectedness with the diversities, yet everything dissolves into a\nseamless formation of a total situation. Everything includes the sense of self and others, hereness and\nnowness, time and space, mind and body, physical and materiality and so and and so forth.\nBut I am not looking at DO. In the Taoism YouTube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V3FknauoYo )\nthat Soh\nposted, Jason Gregory provides another perspective to look at the agency-action issue. The emphasis is\nmore on habitual repetition into elimination of the agent from the action/activity.\nBut I am not referring to that as well. I am looking more on the non-attachment aspect, the freedom from\ngain/loss, success/failure, pride and fear in any endeavour. Practicing that way, the gap between the\nagent and action will also be gradually reduced to none, into the flow of actionless action.\nAs for falling into PCEs, there is nothing wrong falling into PCEs imo; just how uncontrived and effortless,\nhow natural and spontaneous the PCEs are. More importantly, are the PCEs endowed with deep wisdoms\nthat sees through:\n1. self (anatta)\n2. phenomena (chariot analogy)\n1031\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n3. characteristics (redness of a flower).

Appears but not found.\nTo me over-emphasis of non-conceptualities (too early) is an extreme and can be a great disservice as it\n\"bypasses\" those valuable insights that see through reifications and semantic/meaning of\nconventionalities.\nBut seeing through \"thingness\" moderates this extremity, it is like the middle path between conceptual\nand non-conceptualities.\nEventually and gradually, everything too will be de-constructed; no thoughts and concepts, calmly and\nevenly into transparent pristine appearances in natural spontaneity.\n1\n· Reply\n· 1d · Edited\nMr. AA\nI don't understand why can't redness be in the mind - not intrinsically so, of course.\n· Reply\n· 20h\nGeovani Geo\nI guess its because \"redness\" would be another \"thing\".\n· Reply\n· 13h · Edited\nJohn Tan\nYes André\n, I am referring to intrinsically and inherently.\nThat said, you may also want to look deeper into point 4 and compare it with the de-construction of\n\"thingness/inherent-ness\" of my earlier message:\n1. The very idea of \"in\", the very idea of \"from\" or the idea of \"produce\" are all sematics of\nconventionalities. We have mistaken \"meanings\" of these conventions as undeniable \"reality\" but they too\nare imputed. The mind thinks surely even without labels and designations, there is still the actuality of\nbeing \"in\" something, somewhere but this is not true. \"In-ness\" too is a formation formed from \"mental\nconstructions + sensations\". They can similarly be de-constructed.\nIf a mind free from all these sematics of conventionalities or total exhaustion of conceptualities, what is\nexperience like?\nIt is not \"knowingness\" nor a \"not knowing mind\", but just liberating all sematics of conventions and\nsimply resting as mere clean, pure, pellucid sense of vivid radiance (in absorption)?\n2.

Such awareness is\nseeing through the luminosity of \"things\". But this is still a \"doing\", right? The \"problem\" with this is that\nthere is a subtle duality awareness/stuff-being-awared. Then some may come up with the notion that\nawareness is not other then what is being awared. That there is only awareness. And here, I guess, is\nwhere inherency comes in. Fundamentally, is there an awareness at all? Or such awareness was also jsut\na skillful means, a pointer?\n1033\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nIf there is not such inherent awareness, then what is here? Is there any kind of measurable dimension\nthat could be established? etc...\n· Reply\n· 1d\nJohn Tan\nAndré\n, what I am talking about is the phenomelogy of day to day mumdane experiences, nothing\ntranscendental.\nI'm merely looking at how mental constructs created by our language structures and social conventions\ndefine and shape our moment to moment of experiences.\nWhen we say our body is having such and such sensations, the mind really thinks in terms of\ncontainment. When we try to search for the referent we called \"body\", we realized there is no \"body\"\napart from the dancing and fluxing sensations. So again, there are no two parts -- body and sensations;\nwhat we designate as \"body\" is just these sensations.\nOnce the mind sees through this \"body construct\", the sense of \"in-ness\" also dissolves. Sensations are\nsimply present, no where, zero dimension. Same for \"self/Self\" as a background.\nJust this experiential taste of thorough deconstruction is enough to take up my whole life.\nAs a side note, in Taoism there is the art of \"sit and forget\" 坐忘. To sit and forget the \"body\" is difficult, to\nsee through mental constructs is much easier once we get a hang of it and it is more penetrating and\ninsightful.\nOk André, been chatting too much. Thks for the exchanges.\n4\n· Reply\n· 16h · Edited\nJohn Tan\nMr GG\nto me, to be without dual is not to subsume into one and although awareness is negated, it is not to say\nthere is nothing.\nNegating the Awareness/Presence (Absolute) is to not let Awareness remain at the abstract level. When\nsuch transpersonal Awareness that exists only in wonderland is negated, the vivid radiance of presence\nare fully tasted as the transient appearances; zero gap and zero distance between presence and moment\nto moment of ordinary experiences and we realize that \"presence\" has always only been a convention for\nthese vivid ordinary experiences.\nThen mundane activities -- hearing, sitting, standing, seeing and sensing, become pristine and vibrant,\nnatural and free.\n3\n· Reply\n· 15h · Edited\nMr GG\nJohn\n1034\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n, yes.

Tx!!\n· Reply\n· 5h” – A conversation with John Tan, 2020, Active/Inactive Mode of No-Self, Duration to Buddhahood, Etc\n“André A. Pais yes essencelessness as \"antidote\" for the mind in confusion. Since conventional things are\nempty, they are neither same nor different but merely designated as same or difference. So emptiness of\nthe conventional is ultimate. Hence look at the nature of the dream itself, not anything apart from the\ndreams. So to the gelug, the conventional and the emptiness of the conventional are enough, why the\nneed for the cessation of the conventional?\nThere are 2 parts imo:\n1. The empty nature of the conventional is primordially free from notions of sameness and difference. So\nno need to have another state other than realising the nature of the conventional.\n2. The implications and power of designations and its relationship with the mind.\nThe mind must clearly see both to willingly release and relief itself. Without this clear seeing, willingness\ndoes not arise and without this willingness, the mind can't let go.\nBut there is another part of the story. That relates to the unmade and unconditioned free from all\nconceptualities and notions that Geovani Geo promotes . That must be clearly differentiated from\n\"not thinking\" or simply being \"non-conceptual\", nor is it a neutral state that immobilizes one's\ndiscernment.\nThe unmade, is not lost in the conventional and not gained in the non-conceptual -- no entry nor exit\npoint. There is no training needed and no path to it; no ladder to climb and no goal to achieve, precisely\nas this is what natural spontaneity is not. Yet it is not a beyond state in wonderland, just the marvelous on\nspot appearances right in the relative and day to day mundane activities. In the realm of natural\nspontaneity, whatever seen, heard, smelled, sensed and tasted are all unique masterpieces of art, magic\nand miraculous beyond descriptions.\nBut this should not deny one from the conventional and there is no way to deny the conventional. In the\nconventional and conceptual world, everything is \"made\" and \"artificial\". Since they are conventional and\n\"created\", there is journey to travel, conventions to learn, goals to achieve and most importantly, one\nneeds to arise the wisdom, that can help us navigate, sort out and discern clearly the conventional and\nthe ultimate.\nSo my last question, if ultimately you have to re-enter the conventional after transcending of the\nconceptual, do you end up like what the gelug says? ” – John Tan, 2021\n1035\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWhat emptiness is NOT\n• Emptiness is not a substance\n• Emptiness is not a substratum or background\n• Emptiness is not light\n• Emptiness is not consciousness or awareness\n• Emptiness is not the Absolute\n• Emptiness does not exist on its own\n• Objects do not consist of emptiness\n• Objects do not arise from emptiness\n• Emptiness of the \"I\" does not negate the \"I\"\n• Emptiness is not the feeling that results when no objects are appearing to the mind\n• Meditating on emptiness does not consist of quieting the mind\n(Source: Non-Dual Emptiness Teaching, by Greg Goode)\nJohn Tan added:\nEmptiness is not a path of practice\nEmptiness is not a form of fruition\n“Right, because in recognition of dharmatā it is intimately known that phenomena have been non-arisen\nfrom the very beginning. Ergo, attempting to will phenomena to be empty is functioning through the\npresupposition that there is something which actually needs to become empty. In such an act, which is\nexecuted from the standpoint of mind, all that is accomplished is reification of a subject relating to an\nobject, which means one has constructed a fixed reference point. In the eyes of Atiyoga, the view is stupid\nbecause it fails to recognize uncontrived dharmatā, and so the individual attempts to discover dharmatā\nthrough contrived effort.\nFor example; Jigme Lingpa states:\n\"Here the external forms that are perceived are not designated as empty of self. When emptiness is made an\nintellectual object, the form and emptiness aspects of the object arise in the intellect. However since the\nperceived forms have no intrinsic characteristics, those forms should not mix with the intellect. Therefore the\nstatement, 'Emptiness is not other than form, nor form other than emptiness,' should be taken as an axiom\"\nHe also states that from the standpoint of vidya; \"appearances are not cut with the razor of emptiness\",\nrather, they are known to have been empty from the very beginning (although the definitive expression of\ntheir emptiness may not be ascertained until later in the path. Either way, the meditation of Dzogpa\nChenpo is resting in uncontrived dharmatā).\n\"In the gol shor tshar gcod seng ge'i ngar ro, Jigme Lingpa enumerates four mistaken approaches to emptiness,\n1036\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nwhich he calls the 'four ways of straying [shor sa bzhi].' These are borrowed from the Mahāmudrā tradition,\nwhere they are to be found at least as far back as Dagpo Tashi Namgyal (1512-87), who enumerates them in his\nLegshe Dawai Özer. They are: (i) straying into the condition where emptiness is an object of knowledge, (ii)\nstraying into taking emptiness as the path, (iii) straying into taking emptiness as an antidote, and (iv) straying\ninto taking emptiness as a seal.\"\n- Sam Van Schaik” – Kyle Dixon, 2014, https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?t=15714&start=380\n“The most common connotation of \"nonduality\" is \"oneness\" or \"singularity.\" Many teachings state that\neverything is actually awareness; those teachings are nondual in the \"oneness\" sense in which there are\nno two things.\nBut there is another sense of \"nonduality.\" Instead of nonduality as \"oneness,\" it's nonduality as \"free from\ndualistic extremes.\" This entails freedom from the pairs of metaphysical dualisms such as\nessentialism/nihilism, existence/non-existence, reification/annihilation, presence/absence, or\nintrinsicality/voidness, etc. These pairs are dualisms in this sense: if you experience things in the world in\nterms of one side of the pair, you will experience things in the world in terms of the other side as well. If\nsome things seem like they truly exist, then other things will seem like they truly don't exist. You will\nexperience your own self to truly exist, and fear that one day you will truly not exist. Emptiness teachings\nshow how none of these pairs make sense, and free you from experiencing yourself and the world in terms\nof these opposites. Emptiness teachings are nondual in this sense.\nFor those who encounter emptiness teachings after they've become familiar with awareness teachings, it's\nvery tempting to misread the emptiness teachings by substituting terms. That is, it's very easy to misread\nthe emptiness teachings by seeing \"emptiness\" on the page and thinking to yourself, \"awareness,\nconsciousness, I know what they're talking about.\"\nEarly in my own investigations I began with this substitution in mind. With this misreading, I found a lot in\nthe emptiness teachings to be quite INcomprehensible! So I started again, laying aside the notion that\n\"emptiness\" and \"awareness\" were equivalent. I tried to let the emptiness teachings speak for themselves.\nI came to find that they have a subtle beauty and power, a flavor quite different from the awareness\nteachings. Emptiness teachings do not speak of emptiness as a true nature that underlies or supports\nthings. Rather, it speaks of selves and things as essenceless and free. ”\n~ Greg Goode, Non-dual Emptiness Teachings\n“Emptiness and awareness are separate teachings. There are cases, such as Dzogchen and\nScott Kiloby’s Living Realization teachings, where they are combined. But this is not always done.\nWhat I find interesting is that either one of these paths, awareness, and emptiness, can function just fine\nwithout help from the other. Neither one needs the other. Neither one can be reduced to the other.\n1037\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nNeither one requires an external standard that reconciles them. They don’t need to be reconciled any\nmore than French and German need to be reconciled.”\n~ Greg Goode http://www.liberationunleashed.com/resources/articles/the-emptiness-teachings/\n“They [awareness and emptiness teachings] are separated as I said and require separate pointings.\nDependent arising and emptiness is not pointing at awareness but we have to apply this knowledge to\nunderstand the nature of awareness. This is what I realized.” - John Tan, 2019\n“Nondualism, as an ontological position, is foreign to all Buddhist teachings. Even the first verse of the rig\npa khyu byug points this \"The primal nature (prakṛti) of diversity is nondual.\" You cannot have a nondual\nnature of diversity if there is no diversity.\nThe nonbuddhist nondualism asserts that all phenomena are just one thing, \"one without a second,\" and\nthat all perception of diversity is a product of false consciousness. This ontological substance is called\nbrahman, or shiva, whatever.\nThe term \"nondual\" in Buddhadharma refers to an absence of a pair, such as being and nonbeing, subject\nand object, pure and impure. Such pairs are not established. In absence of establishing existence, for\nexample, there cannot be nonexistence. In absence of establishing a subject, there cannot be an object,\nand vice versa; and in absence of establishing purity, there cannot be impurity. But when we say these\npairs are not established, we are not asserting there is some foundation or basis which itself established.”\n- Acarya Malcolm Smith, 2019\n“Christian Krok Understanding “non-dual” in the Buddhist sense as pertaining to emptiness and non-\narising is key.\nIf the nature of phenomena is free from extremes it is free from dual extremes hence “non-dual.”\nAlso dharmins and their respective dharmatā are neither the same nor different, hence “non-dual.”\nAs mentioned non-Buddhist non-duality is ontological because it concerns a single nature that is free of\ndivision... while “non-dual” in the Buddhist sense is epistemic because it relates to an accurate knowledge\nof phenomena. If that knowledge is absent then duality is perceived.” - Kyle Dixon, 2019\n“Emptiness is not an Absolute. Unlike systems that teach an Ultimate Reality like Nirguna Brahman that is\nempty of all attributes except its own true existence as a changeless principle of consciousness, the\nemptiness of Prasangika Madhyamika does not establish emptiness to be inherently existing, let alone an\nAbsolute. As emptiness simply means that any given conventional self and phenomena are empty of\ninherent existence by its own side (the import being that ALL self/Self and phenomena are only\n1038\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nestablished via conventional imputation or dependent designation), it is merely a negation of the wrong\nway of understanding phenomena and not the positing of a certain position regarding how reality\ninherently exists as. Furthermore, emptiness too is empty: the emptiness of a cup depends on the\nconventional cup. Emptiness is not some singular inherently existing principle out of which all\nphenomena are made of or come from.\nUnder the system of Prasangika Madhyamika, nothing is left unscrutinized - be it emptiness, Awareness,\nConsciousness, Brahman, and so on. It demolishes all grounds and leaves no existents to cling on to.\nUnlike how the Vedantins mistakenly think: the Shunyata or Emptiness of Buddhism is not the via\nnegativa way to arrive at the same ground that adherents of a ‘via positiva’ approach takes.\nHere is a good article by Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche (try to read this article in its entirety):\nExcerpts: Madhyamika Buddhism Vis-a-vis Hindu Vedanta ,\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html\n\"...However, the Buddhist ultimate truth is the absence of any such satta, i.e., and ultimately existing thing\nor ultimate reality. The significance of Shunyata is the absence of any real, independent, unchanging\nexistence (svabhava) and that fact is the ultimate truth of Buddhism, which is diametrically opposite of\nthe ultimate truth of the Hindu Atman-Brahman. So Shunyata or emptiness can never be via negativa, a\nnegative way of describing the Atman-Brahman of Hinduism as Vinoba Bhave and such scholars would\nhave us believe. The meaning of Shunyata found in Sutra, Tantra, Dzogchen and Mahamudra is the same\nand officially accepted by all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism (except those who adhere to the Shentong\nview) and that is the Prasangic emptiness of Chandrakirti, i.e., the unfindability of any true existence or\nsimply unfindability (unupalabdhi).\n...\nBecause the same language structure (be it Pali or Sanskrit) and the same analogies are used to express\ntwo different paradigms, many Vedantins or scholars of Buddhism with Vedantic backgrounds have been\nfooled into thinking Buddhist Madhyamika is a re-interpretation of Hindu Vedanta. For example, many\nlike Vinova Bhave the guru revered by the late Prime minister of India Indira Gandhi, perceive Buddhism\nas a negative way to attain the same goal (via negativa), whereas Hindu Vedanta is the positive way (via\npositiva). Likes of Bhave and others argue that the Buddhists use negation, whereas the Vedantis use\naffirmation and therefore the Shunyata of Buddhism is a negative way of talking about the Brahman of\nthe Vedanta.\nThe issue here is not via negative or positive, but rather approaching two different goals based on two\ndifferent paradigms, or addressing two diametrically opposed answers to the burning issue of mankind\ndeveloped from diametrically opposed paradigms. In fact, the Buddha, after engaging in long years of\n1039\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nBrahmanic as well as Sramanic meditations, found the concept of Brahman (an ultimately real,\nunchanging, eternal substratum [paramartha satta] to this ephemeral transient world) inadequate to\nsolve the basic issue of humanity, i.e., suffering (dukkha ). He questioned the very existence of such an\neternal substratum and also declared that a search for such an imagined Brahman ( parikalpita atman)\nwas a form of escapism and, therefore, not really spiritual but “Spiritual Materialism”.\nSince the concept of Brahman, the truly existent (paramartha satta) is the very foundation of Hinduism\n(as a matter of fact some form of an eternal ultimate reality whether it is called God or Nature is the basis\nof all other religious systems). When Buddhism denies such an ultimate reality (paramartha satta) in any\nform, it cuts at the very jugular veins of Hinduism and all other Theistic systems. Therefore, it cannot be\nontologically, epistemologically, and soteriologically said that Buddhism reforms Hinduism.\nThe affirmation of a ground (asraya) which is really existent (paramartha satta) and the denial that such\nan existent ground (satta) can be found anywhere, within or without, immanent or transcendent, are two\ndiametrically opposed paradigms, not simply variation or reformations of each other. The Webster\nDictionary defines re-form as ‘to amend or improve by change of form or removal of faults or abuse.’ The\nexample I have given above of an eternal base without which Hinduism in its own language would be\ncalled atheistic (Nastik). Therefore, the denial (without any implied affirmation prasajya pratisheda) of\nsuch an eternally existing unchanging base by Buddhism cannot be said to be a reformation, but a\ndeconstruction of the very roots of the Hindu thesis. That is why Buddhism is not a reformation of\nHinduism but a paradigm shift from the foundations on which Hinduism is based.\nHindu scholastic polemics assert that without an ultimate eternal reality (pramartha satta), there can be\nno liberation from the changing, transient Samsara which is an illusion. Therefore, even though the\nBuddha denied such an ultimate reality, he could have meant only conceptually really existing\nreality/relative reality, not the eternal ultimate reality, which is beyond concepts. Otherwise there cannot\nbe liberation. The fault with this kind of thinking is that it is measuring the thesis of the Buddha (which is\nno thesis), or interpreting the Buddha from within the Hindu paradigm, within which, an eternal ultimate\nreality (paramartha satta) is a necessity for soteriological purpose, i.e., for liberation as Samsara itself is\nmerely an illusion (maya) and cannot liberate us. However the Buddha saw this as a necessary dead-end.\nSince according to the Buddha, there is no Brahman, such a concept being merely an acquired fabrication\n(parikalpana) learned from wrong (mithya ) scriptures, hankering after or searching for such a Brahman\nleads nowhere, let alone liberation. Hence, the Buddhist paradigm if understood correctly, does not\nrequire an eternally existing something or other for liberation.\nIn Buddhism liberation is not about realizing such a ground but rather letting go of all grounds, i.e.,\nrealizing the “groundlessness” of Samsara which is not really an illusion per se but “like an illusion”\n(mayavat). As Nagarjuna puts it aptly in his Magnum Opus, Mulamadhyamakakarika ‘sarva drishti\nprahanaya yah saddharmam adeshayet.’ That is ‘the Buddha taught out of compassion the true dharma\nfor the sake of letting go of all views.’ (Drishti Parikshya, Investigation of view, chapter 27 verse 30). In the\n1040\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nTheravadin Majjhima Nikaya, Dighanakha Sutta and the Aggivacchagotta Sutta , the Buddha himself says\nthat ‘all others leave one view only to hold on to another view but the Tathagata let goes all view and does\nnot grasp to any other view.’ The Phenopindopama Sutra states very clearly that the five aggregates\n( pancha skandha), which is the Samsara, is like a bubble, like foam, like an illusion. It does not say the five\naggregates are an illusion but “like an illusion”. In fact, according to Buddhism, holding on to any ground\nis ignorance and is called innate clinging to the concept of a truly existing self (sahaja atman graha).\nTherefore, in the Buddhist paradigm, it is not only ‘not necessary’ to have an eternal ground for liberation,\nbut in fact, the belief in such a ground itself is part of the dynamics of ignorance. We now move to\nanother major difference within the two paradigms...” - Soh, 2019\n“To me, I'm a non-sectarian, so I am quite free not having prejudice for/against Theravada, Mahayana or\nVajrayana. We get our experience and teaching to release, as well as to relief ourselves from our suffering\nfrom a great teaching.\nTo come to our understanding of what is the fundamental cause of our suffering, and the core teaching\nof Selflessness is not that straight forward. We experiment and test our paradigm to see if it works. It is a\nlife experience and journey.\nIn my experience and journey, there is essential two paths. First is taking and seeking comfort in the\nultimate and carrying it throughout, and the other, is looking into the fundamental core of suffering and\nunderstanding its nature. So there are basically these two - one relies on the essentialist practice that\nthey need to have an ultimate, and the other says no... there is no need to, you just have to understand\nthe nature of suffering. Therefore when we clearly see this, we realize that Buddhism is based on the\nlatter, and the whole development of Theravada and Mahayana is based on such a system. Otherwise\nthere is no difference from other (religions). As such it depends on an individual path and which core\nsystem one believes in.\nFor me, the essence view has in a certain sense proven to not be the way and I greatly appreciate the\nBuddha's path. To state otherwise would mean that Buddhism is using the view of an essence to solve\nsuffering, which isn't true for me.” - John Tan, 2015, “What is an Authentic Buddhist Teaching?”\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2016/07/what-is-authentic-buddhist-teaching.html\nRecognition of Appearances as One’s Empty Radiance Clarity\n“You have to distinguish between seeing \"inseparability\" of clarity and emptiness from seeing clarity\nalone. That is when Mipham is talking about clarity, he is referring to empty clarity which is not the same\nas seeing Clarity as ultimate. Like when I tell you awareness is natural and free, it does not mean there is\nanother extra awareness other than sound, thoughts, sensations, colors, smells… In other words, there is\nongoing awaring in the form of sound, sensations, hardness, softness, coldness, emotions… etc. No\n1041\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nawareness… As such we have the issue of saying it cannot be said to be clarity nor other than clarity. To\nrefine and have deeper insight of clarity, therefore requires a paradigm shift. Nothing is being\ntransformed from this to that. Rather it is under what condition, this arises. And understand dependent\narising is non-arisen to realize the nature of clarity/phenomena.” - John Tan, 2015\n“Actually IMO, anatta is the true direct short cut of tasting one's empty clarity. But best not to link to\nDzogchen.\nI prefer to use my own terms and deconstruction method like seeing through mental constructs and\ntraining the mind to see in terms of DO [dependent origination], emptiness and non-arisen of phenomena\nto further refine one's deconstruction practice.” – John Tan, 2020\nAs stated at the beginning and end of this guide, the 7 stages do not unfold in the same exact linear steps\nfor everyone. For some, it is the reverse. For some practitioners, they may have certain insights into\nemptiness and dependent origination but lack the direct realization of appearances as one’s radiance\nclarity. And hence for these people, John Tan said, “...empty clarity is highest teaching. To me [that] is peak\nof [stage] 5. Post 5 [i.e. stage 6] is [about] knowledge of Dependent Origination and emptiness, which I\nthink is more [of a crucial] key. Roaming in Conventional world in freedom requires deep wisdom that is\nnot covered in the insight of clarity.”. However as John also pointed out, lacking the insights into 5, the\nunderstanding of dependent origination and emptiness tends to be intellectual. For these people, a\nseparate pointing to recognise all appearances as one’s empty radiance clarity may be necessary.\n[1/8/23, 12:14:20 PM] John Tan: Yes I agree. Because many understand from essential view and thought\nthey understood freedom from all elaborations. If it contradicts DO [dependente origination], then the\nview is essential view like what Tsongkhapa said.\nMeans there is no contradiction between spontaneous presence and dependent arising.\nAlso when one deconstruct, there are 2 authentications; one relates to de-construction of conceptual\nmind and the other is recognizing and directly tasting the empty radiance.\n[1/8/23, 12:15:44 PM] John Tan: Whether, we deconstruct self, internality-externality, physicality, cause-\neffect, we must have this direct taste of radiance and relates to the actual taste.\n.....\n[27/8/23, 9:29:26 AM] John Tan:\nNot only that you cannot realize emptiness without the clarity, you cannot realize dependent origination\nwithout clarity, they are both talking about radiance and light.\n1042\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAnother important point is we do not realize that we are analysing and understanding from the\nperspective from essential view. We \"negate\" from the standpoint of an essential view; we understand\ndependent arising from an inherent view without realizing it. We do not understand from the perspective\nof light and radiance.\nThey understand \"illusion\" from an essential view and thought that because of illusoriness, it is\ninconsequential.\n.....\n[8/9/23, 2:26:14 PM] John Tan: I suggest you look into DO, emptiness and understand the non-\ncontradiction between free from all elaborations and DO-emptiness of the conventional.\nIt is not easy to understand functioning in the non-essential way of manifestations.\nEven if one is clear of how the mind confuses itself with essential view in terms reification of entities-\ncharacteristics, it does not mean one can understand how empty radiance functions in the non-essential\nway.\nThis requires not only stable insights but also very stable authentication of energy and radiance patterns -\n- that the natural expressions of empty radiance exhibits certain patterns.\n[8/9/23, 2:35:06 PM] John Tan: For example, you think it is so easy to come out the 12 afflictive chain of\nDO?\n[8/9/23, 2:36:49 PM] John Tan: This requires very stable insight and radiance experience and observe how\na mind in confusion sets the wheel of samsara in action.\n[8/9/23, 2:42:06 PM] John Tan: Do you think it is so easy to point out consciousness and phenomena are\nlike the 8 similes of illusions? Or despite vivid appearances, there is nothing that is \"there\" at all, no\n\"thingness\" can be found at all and because of this empty nature, whole of samsara as well of the\nimmense diversities of radiance can manifest? How skillful is it in that pointing? Yet we just simply read\npass such profound pointing. .....\n“Once you understand, then MMK becomes clear. Like sprout and plant, plant and tree; like growing and\ndecaying; every object, every phenomenon, every line of demarcation identified is empty.\nHaving this understanding, we look into our own mind. When we look into mind, there is no mind other\nthan the ongoing appearances. When you look into appearances, there is no appearances either, it is just\none's radiance clarity.\nTherefore without insight into emptiness, we do not know the nature of mind/phenomena; consequently,\nno true realization of clarity. Clarity is empty and anatta insight is the first taste of this knowledge of\n1043\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nemptiness. Applying this insight of emptiness on clarity and appearances, the relationship of emptiness,\nclarity and appearances is fully understood. Rest is just day to day authentication of this truth. There is\nno ending to it.”\n• John Tan, 2019\n“From anatta to the natural state of spontaneous perfection is essentially to understand the breadth and\ndepth of what hinders and is meant by being \"natural\". The journey is effectively how an immature mind\nthat is full of all sort of artificialities frees itself into its primordial natural condition that is boundless and\nfree.\nWhy are there stages? There are stages because it is based on a proliferated mind. The fragmented mind\ncreates stages as that is how it understands and works, it separates and re-connects what that has never\nbeen separated. Realizing the illusion of separation, there is no re-connection either. So the self is empty,\nthe other is empty, the line that demarcates them is also empty.\nAs for investigation into the nature of appearances, perhaps you can elaborate more on what do you\nmean by appearances?\nI think we must also separate direct knowledge of one's empty clarity from the relative conceptual\nknowledge of mind and how are they \"linked\". Can Madhyamaka bring about direct recognition of one’s\nradiance clarity? If not, what is the role of mmk (mulamadhyamakakarika)?\n...\nIn my previous message, I mentioned about anatta and spontaneous perfection as returning to one's\nnatural and authentic condition because I hope you can see it from another angle.\nTo some, in the seen, just the seen sounded like a perfect state of concentration through long period of\ntraining and practice. To me however, the taste of anatta is the birthright, primordial and natural\ncondition of one's clarity.\nSeeing is just seen, no seer; Hearing is just sound, no hearer. It is the gateway to realize that the mundane\nis precisely where one's natural radiance is fully expressed. Nothing hidden, nothing beyond and fully\nmanifested.\nWhat does freedom from reification entail? It is to get rid of all \"beyonds\", all \"backgrounds\", all\nconstructs so that we can recognize \"face to face\" of what's seen, heard, touched... etc as one's empty\nclarity, not to bring us to an unreachable la la land. So wherever and whenever I see dependent arising\nand emptiness, I see one's empty clarity.\n1044\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSome can realize directly one's empty clarity through seeing emptiness, just like case of the insight of\nanatta, but some can't. If this isn't obvious, then separate pointing is necessary.\nLastly the true practice is in ceaselessly meeting conditions and situations, without that, there is no\ngenuine actualization.\nGood luck!” - John Tan 2018\n...\n\"When one says mind or basis or clarity or presence, it is only conventional expression. If we mistaken\nthere is anything to grasp or anything beyond or ineffable, it is immediately mistaken. However if we just\nstop there it becomes nihilistic. Because the purpose is to allow one to clearly and fully realize, feel and\ntaste the moment to moment of manifestation. To clearly see and understand the nature of what is felt,\nseen, taste, heard and thought. It is not only no seer, but in the seen just the seen. However in the seen\njust the seen can be seen as a form of focus shamatha concentration. Therefore I always say it is the\nnatural state.\" - John Tan 2018\nJohn also wrote in 2007,\n\"The understanding 'of arising as yuan (conditions)' must be factored to all aspects of our lives. Applying\nthis insight to the six stages of my experiences, you must see them not as indications of stages at all. There\nare no higher or lower stages, all merely serves as conditions for ‘new insight’ to arise. A practitioner may\nstart from training himself to ‘witness’ the empty nature of phenomena (stage 6) yet still having a clear\ndistinction of observer and observed being dual; but the gradual loosening of ‘solidity’ of all internal or\nexternal phenomena having no inherent existence will slowly leads to the non-dual experience.\"\n\"Here the highlight must not only be the empty nature of ‘sound’ alone, that luminosity as ‘sound’ must\nsimilarly be emphasized. When we stripped-off the symbolic representation of ‘bird’, ‘chirping’, ‘outside’,\n‘eyes-organ’, ‘ears-organs’, ‘sensate reality’ and merely experience in bare, this is the meditative state of\nintuitively knowing that quality of being luminous in oneness. Oneness as there is nothing to divide when\ndevoid of these symbolic layering. The depth of the crystal clarity of that pure experience – ‘chirping’ is not\nwhat language can convey. The point here is not to bring about a scientific study on the topic of qualia but\nto have a direct feel of the full absorption in the delight of that clear-luminosity of ‘sound’. It is the ‘depth\nand degree’ of absorptive-clarity yet non-staying that is most important; not the symbolic understanding of\nmeanings.\n“[5:23 PM, 4/5/2020] John Tan: The mind has the habits of seeing whatever appears as entities and things.\nSo it first tells us that this habit and tendency must be overcome. Then it talks about the nature of mind\nwhich is quite different from my usage as I directly and literally translate \"nature\" from the Chinese\n1045\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\ncharacter 性 (Soh: Nature). So nature of mind to me is emptiness 空性 (Soh: Empty Nature) and not\n\"clarity\".\nSecond it spoke of we must realize and identify this \"nature of mind\" directly, so what it means here by\n\"nature of mind\" sounded to me like \"明心\" (Soh: Apprehending Mind) rather than 见性 (Soh: Seeing\nNature). Therefore when you read, you have to discern correctly.\nNext is what has directly experiencing mind (referred in the book as \"nature of mind\") got to do with\nmistaking things as true existence and mistaking there is Self/self? Why are things perceived as illusion\ngot to do with \"nature of mind (明心) (Soh: Apprehending Mind) here? This is the first question to ask. In\nfact post this experience of 明心 (Soh: Apprehending Mind), we become more attached to 心 (Soh: Mind).\nSo this part must be carefully addressed.\nSo how should we practice? That is, is 明心 (Soh: Apprehending Mind) the way and is that wrong\nemphasis? If it is then it becomes awareness teaching.\nSo there are three parts:\n1. 明心 (Soh: Apprehending Mind)\n2. 见性 (Soh: Seeing Nature) as 悟性空 (Soh: Realizing Empty Nature)\n3. Integrate the two\nThe integration is empty cognizance. yOYou can never find a constant something somewhere called\nCognizant. So what and where is this cognizant?\nWhy can't why does it seems so evasive?\nWhat has it got to do with non-dual experience?\n[5:58 PM, 4/5/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. no cognizance in and of itself besides manifestation and aggregates,\nthose aggregates are also empty, non arisen an illusionlike due to its essenceless nature.. not due to\nawareness\n[6:04 PM, 4/5/2020] John Tan: Yes. So anatta is the experiential insight of this and therefore the direct,\neffortless presencing of every moment. The view and teaching must make this clear.”\nIt should however be understood that recognition of all appearances as one’s empty-clarity is not the\ninsight of Stage 6. As John Tan said, “They [Gelugpas/Emptiness teachings] do not require a ground\nfoundational consciousness, do not seek presence, what do they rely on to release?\n1046\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSoh: The release of the sense of phenomena truly there that can be found when sought, existing with\nEssence, by itself or on its own side. The conventions are seen to be empty\nJohn Tan: So in phase 6, don't talk about presence. Talk about the general dependent origination into\nemptiness. In terms of experience, fully refine +A and -A.”\n“Purpose of DO and emptiness is not to subsume all into mind but to negate any sort of inherentness.\nThat is to realise primordial, unconditioned nature of whatever arises.\nKnowing mind (clarity) is not knowing the nature of mind and the nature of mind is not for knowing nor\ncan it be known, learned or studied, that is why it is purging of all views. It can however be expressed as a\nnegation of all inherent-ness. Free from all substantialities and extreme, there is just unconditioned\nexpression in natural spontaneity.\nLike the previous texts you posted about the \"one life\". I think I have discussed this with you before in\nour early conversations.\nWe must differentiate and discern experience free from a background and source.\nWhat happened when the background is gone? There is the non-doership aspect and the luminous clarity\naspect.\nAbscribing all as life is an extrapolation as I told you before. There is no need to create an alternate\nsource call \"one life\". The experienced as being lived by and expression of life is just an experience of\nnon-doership due to freedom from background source. However one must still be able to discern correct\nwhat is unconditioned expression and what is karmic habituation.” – John Tan, 2020\n“When you are free from all views, there is just natural spontaneity free from all elaborations. When\nengaged in the relative and conventional world, see everything as dependently originated, which is\nnaturally balanced and perfected.” – John Tan, 2021\n…\nJohn Tan wrote in 2012/2013:\n“In ignorance, there is hearer hearing sound.\nIn anatta, in hearing, only sound.\nYet sound has no true inherent nature (empty),\nIt is an activity and is that very activity called “hearing”.\nBoth “hearing and sound” are pointing to the same activity.\nOnly when seen to have true existence on either side does confusion arise.\nIn Madhyamaka Emptiness, reification is seen through.\nYet the experiential state of freedom from reification is not expounded.\n1047\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nHowever, one can have a taste of that freedom from arising insight of anatta since anatta is precisely the\nfreedom from reification of Self/self (First fold Emptiness).\nIn anatta, seeing is simply the full scenery, in hearing only sound…\nthus, always only lights, shape, colors, sounds, scents… in clean purity.\nEmptying the object further (second fold) is merely dissolving subtle bond of “externality” that creates the\nappearance of true existence of objects outside. When “externality” is deconstructed, it is effectively a\ndouble confirmation of anatta…\n…innerly coreless and outwardly empty, all appearances are still simply sound, lights, colors and rays\nIn thorough deconstruction, as there is no layer that reifies, there is no conceptuality. Therefore no\ncomplication, no confusion, no stains, no boundaries, no center, no sense of dual..\nno sense of activity… just self arising.\nAll collapse into a single sphere of natural presence and spontaneous simplicity.\nWhatever appears is\nneither here nor now,\nNeither in nor out,\nNeither arises nor ceases,\nIn the same space…\nnon-local, timeless and dimensionless\nSimply present…\nTo Mr. J:\nThe place where there is no earth, fire, wind, space water…\nis the place where the earth, fire, wind, space and water kills “You” and fully shines as its own radiance, a\ncomplete taste of itself and fully itself.\nLastly, it is interesting to get to know something about Dzogchen, however the jargons and tenets are far\nbeyond me.\nJust wrote due to a sudden spurt of interest, nothing intense.\nThanks for all the sharing and exchanges.\nGone!”\n“The knowing is precisely the known and vice versa.\nOnly in ignorance does the knowing appear to co-locate with the known.\nIf both are realized as mere conventions that arise in dependence of the other,\nThen the middle way that severs the extremes can be understood”\n…\n[9:28 AM, 4/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: I explained i am already way past the phase of i amness realisation in\nspiritual enlightenment\n1048\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nThere is no self within, awareness is just right there where everything is (something like that)\nI was very expressive in explaining:\nIn the seeing, just colors\nIn the hearing, just sound\nBest of all i am free\nThere is no center within and no circumference without\ni also had a plan to explain to him that while i do not see essence in phenomena it does not mean i\nsubsume everything into consciousness\nEverything is like a chariot so besides the functioning and aggregation of dependent arising on display an\n“it” essence cannot be found within or without it\nThat does not mean therefore everything exists only inside some consciousness or some subjectivity\nNor does an essence reside outside in objectivity to be found\nIt just means besides these empty dependent aggregation in function/appearance/operation an essence\ncannot be found\nSo experientially everything is just very vivid and yet essenceless like a mirage or reflection\n“[9:34 PM, 4/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: [quoted a few pages from The Fearless Lion’s Roar: Profound\nInstructions on Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, on the Four Strayings: “The straying point of emptiness’s\nhaving the character of a knowable object, The straying point of taking emptiness as the path, The\nstraying point of taking emptiness as a remedy, The straying point of superimposing emptiness.”] This\njust reminded me of what A wrote\n[9:34 PM, 4/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: From what A wrote he seems to take emptiness as a remedy\n[9:35 PM, 4/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: This seems intellectual.. rather than directly realising whatever appears\nas empty clarity\n[9:38 PM, 4/18/2020] John Tan: Yes. Whatever appears as empty clarity is the whole purpose the teaching\nimo. How do you understand this with DO and emptiness? How does it help?\n[10:10 PM, 4/18/2020] Soh Wei Yu: It’s like what i said about the chariot.. whatever appears does not exist\nin and of itself.. also doesn’t mean nonexistent.. but rather like chariot merely manifest and functions in\ndependence but ultimately unfindable. Phenomena may be reified as objectively existent before and even\nafter anatta... but if one realises all directly perceivable phenomena is of the nature of being like chariot,\n1049\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nessenceless and dependently originating, but not truly originating.. then whatever appears are vividly\nseen as a self luminous display of total exertion yet empty or free of the sense of existence and\nnonexistence, arising and ceasing, etc\n[10:13 PM, 4/18/2020] John Tan: Yes. From experience, there are 2 effects like I always tell you, one is\nfreeing the mind from essence and substance view, the other is the actual expression of the nature of\nwhatever appears.”\n“[1:00 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: However if post anatta and non-dual, it helps one to penetrate further.\nLike how it helps me to understand the nature of clarity. But having an intellectual understanding of\nemptiness. How to relook at phenomena and mind and meditate on them. You will breakthrough\nfurther. When you look at a sensation, hear a sound, taste or vision. When you know emptiness, you\nhave deeper understanding. When you go through mmk and understand more and more about chariot..\nYou see and directly authenticate more and more of mind and phenomena.\n[1:04 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: It will loosen the coventional grip on us and deepen our understanding.\n[1:05 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: Emptiness has another dimension if you practice diligently.\n[1:05 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: It is not just walking in park and appreciate space like openness in non-\ndual mode.\n[1:08 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: Now having non-dual experience or a state of no-mind does not mean\nfinality. We must also free ourselves from many more intellectual obscurations. other obscurations of\ncause. Like having non-dual or no-mind may not free on from the notion of self. Freeing one from the\nnotion of self, may not free one from the notion of cause. Freeing one from the notion of cause, may not\nfree one from the notion of existence. Freeing one from duality, may not free one from non-duality. The\ncolor you see is neither inside, nor outside. It is inside, it is also outside. It is private, it is also public.\nSo it is neither too.\n[1:14 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: So freedom from insight is different from a blank state. So in addition to\nwalking in a park, being anatta, borderless and open, non-dual and total exerted, you must also spend\ntime to free up further intellectual obscurations that blind us.\n[1:18 AM, 5/16/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. through mmk?\n[1:19 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: The chariot analogy is enough...but the diamond splitter, neither one nor\nmany...all these ways of ultimate analysis that see through essence can help also. But simple looking and\nunderstanding the chariot analogy helps me a lot...it depends on individual. Then authenticate it with\nyour actual experience in anatta.\n[1:23 AM, 5/16/2020] John Tan: To me it is not to help resolve that appearances are just one's empty\nclarity but helps to refine my insight on the nature... Our conventional knowledge has cage used into\n1050\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nseeing a separate, divided physical and mental world. The knowledge blinds and bind us to an assumed\nreality that is not easy to break.”\n“Clearing intellectual obscurity actually requires quite some shamata concentration that enables the mind\nto see clearly experience and how the conceptual mind process in a slow motion. It is like anatta but\nmore complex issues are seen clearly in real time.\n...\nOne can be free from subject and object division in experience, but one may not be free from mind-\nmatter duality. There is intellectual mind/matter duality block despite experience being non-dual and\nanatta. Freedom from duality in experience does not mean you are free from mind/matter duality and\nthe relationship between them.” – John Tan, 2020\n“[12:51 AM, 5/14/2020] John Tan: Yeah I read it. Reflection. Like chariot. Neither exist nor not exist.\nNeither cause nor uncaused. Neither here nor not here. Neither arise nor not arise.\nWhen you see that there is mind creating mental activities, you see deluded appearances as there is mind\nand there are mental activities. When you see through mind, you also see through mental activities. When\nyou see through them, there is natural and pure appearances. In Buddhism language, we say mind is\nempty and so are the mental activities. Like in the case of seer seeing the seen. Hearer hearing sound.\nNow what is important is the actual taste, emptiness is not enough, clarity also not enough, non-dual also\nnot enough. It is not only non-dual, it is also not just emptiness, it is also not just clarity. So most crucial is\nthe wisdom to penetrate all these and taste directly pure appearance. It is all these characteristics... vivid,\nclean, pure, luminous, non-dual appearances that cannot be be found anywhere. This of course is non-\nconceptual but non-conceptual is never the goal. So when hearing sound, that sound must be tasted fully\nthen the teaching becomes alive. You should not meddle in text but express in your own words the living\nexperiences.”\nSoh Wei Yu\nbadge icon\n[10:03 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: To me subject-action-object is just a structure to help articulate and make\nsense of the world. I do not see it that way. I see it as total exertion of appearance-conditions, not\nappearance and conditions.\n[10:10 PM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: You are referring to td unmanifest?\n[10:47 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Yes\n[10:49 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: If you see object separated from subject or see phenomena apart from\nmind, no matter how you deconstruct, it is just knowledge. you won't have direct taste of anything.\n1051\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n[10:52 PM, 7/27/2020] Soh Wei Yu: But not all conditions are appearing right, some are simply intuited or\ninferred even when unseen.. so they are merely conventional\n[10:53 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Of course, there is no way to know all conditions involved.\n[10:54 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: It is simply to say appearance do not just manifest.\n[10:56 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: There is also the experience of spaciousness when you go through the\nprocess of deconstructing both subject and object...the experience is like mind body drop.\n[11:04 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: When you say, the car is empty but you are sitting inside it...what do you\nmean?\n[11:05 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: It is same as no wind is blowing...\n[11:05 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Or lightning flashing\n[11:07 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Or spring goes, summer comes...\n[11:09 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Means you apply the same insight to everything\n[11:09 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Only only the self...\n[11:10 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Even movement\n[11:13 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: So your mind is perpetually seeing through constructs, so what happens?\n[11:16 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: Tell me when you say car is empty yet you are sitting on it. you see through\nthe cosntruct, then what happened?\n[11:16 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: When you see through the wind that is blowing...what happened?\n[11:16 PM, 7/27/2020] John Tan: When you see through summer or weather?

Learn the terms not how you know it\nbut how the author is expressing it. Meaning they are saying something very specific.\n1\nGeovani Geo\nAuthor\nAlbert Hong, there is something \"new\" in dealing with these issues anew. We all know the basics,\nbut in a ping-pong dialogue, without copying and pasting, the dynamism may bring in \"something\"\ndifferent, not seen before.

There are different kinds of communication, not jsut one.\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nEven to express it as “allowing manifestation” implies a container of manifestation. There is no\ncontainer. Manifestation is dharmakaya, thats all. That is anatta, then there are two aspects of it\nexpressed in the two stanzas.\n2\nAlbert Hong\nSoh Wei Yu the problem is this deep tendency to reify.\nIt isn't particularly clear that one can make a distinction say between movement and stillness.\nPeople say manifestation arises from space. Or movement arises from stillness.\nIt isn't clear that there is a holding onto stillness and dualizing it from motion.\nIf there are two things then that is dualism pure and simple.\n1054\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAnd yet if we merge that stillness and movement into a single formless substance then we fall into\nMonism and inherent view again.\nThere is a deep tendency for the mind to desire wholeness or oneness. It is very alluring and\nbeautiful to the mind.\n4\n•\nAlbert Hong\nin seeing, no seer. in hearing, no hear. if we just contemplate that then you'd instantly get that\nthere is no extra witness, or space, or container, or self.\n2\no\nChristine Walsh\nAlbert Hong I contemplated just that for years and did not instantly get it. Just sayin'...\n1\n•\nGeovani Geo\nAuthor\nYea.. this is the kind of subtlety that is interesting do converse about. There is a point here that is\nvery difficult to express. Its about that wich is naturally not ever absent. But expressed in this way\nit seems to be something. But it is not! Take 3D-space as an analogy. Is there a thing called space?\nNo. It is originally there, right? The same line of pointing can be extended to the Dharmakaya.\no\nAlbert Hong\nGeovani Geo from what I understand. space is just the luminosity extending infinitely everywhere\nall the time. literally the motion of luminosity creates space. but it also creates all the elements and\nall appearance as well. Yet there is no space as a referent. Nor is there luminosity as a referent.\nNothing can be pinned down as a thing. But we can understand things as endless relations in a\nconventional/nominal way.\nBut people who practice have this experience of a space and then there is arising of stuff from that\nspace. And that experience has within it a series of assumptions.\n1055\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\no\nJenny Jennings Foerst\nAlbert Hong People cannot profitably skip the totalizing-Space phase, but it is only a phase, if one\nkeeps practicing. Luminosity more likely to be recognized if Space phase comes first. I know you\nknow, just mentioning for others.\n1\n•\nJenny Jennings Foerst\nSpace is, yes, a set of assumptions, a construct. So is time, yet time also seems to keep going, so\nthe \"beyond\" of that construct is especially tricky in that \"beyond-ness\" is what is in question. So\nimmediacy, but time travel is possible, too.\n•\nAlbert Hong\nI've heard teachings on the distinction between a presentation verses a representation. And it's a\nuseful way to understand appearance. Appearance or Form is exactly itself. Exactly a presentation\nof itself. It isn't a representation like say a still life painting of an orange. There is the actual orange\n(referent) and the symbol/representation of the orange. This the traditional finger pointing to the\nmoon analogy. But this is also incorrect because there is only ever presentation.\nSo even the painting of the orange, which isn't the actual orange is itself a presentation of itself.\nAnd the orange is as well.\nWhen we focus on lets say the presence. then it isn't clear that presence isn't a thing but the very\npresentation of form.\nAnd form is nothing but constant activity. So form is forming. Presence is presencing. They aren't\ndistinct.\nBut when we reify presence. Then it seems presence is something and everything else is\nsoemthing else. Then we have to naturally unify everything with this presence.\nBut that is incorrect because everything is already exactly itself as forming/presencing.\n6\n•\nAlbert Hong\nSo there is no need to emphasize presence as a thing. or even as something special. because it is\nexactly the forms.\n1056\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n•\nAlbert Hong\nIf you reify a background. Lets say an absence of a background. Then you make that a reference\npoint in relationship to everything else.\nSo it feels and is experienced as an emanationist theory of sorts. Something arises from nothing.\nEven if it seems non dualistic. You are making a distinction in experience between the two.\nsomething and nothing. arising and non arising.\n1\n•\nGeovani Geo\nAuthor\nYes, that is right.\n•\nGeovani Geo\nAuthor\nMovement and stillness cannot be separated. Existence and no-existence neither.\n•\nGeovani Geo\nAuthor\n\"Yet there is no space as a referent. Nor is there luminosity as a referent.\"\nThis is what I meant when used space as an analogy. Space is not something. To say its there\nmakes no sense jsut as to say it is not. Both make it a thing.\no\nAlbert Hong\nIn how people use language when speaking about spiritual or meditative experience, it is common.\nHow people use language is also how they shape their perception, which shapes their\nresponses/actions. It\n1\n•\nAlbert Hong\n1057\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nIt is a whole package. So reification of space, of nothingness, of a container, of something formless\nas distinct from something else.\nIt is very common for meditators.\n•\nAlbert Hong\nMore common then that is the Monist variant of taking formless presence as the single source of\neverything.\nPretty much all the conversation on here. Is nothing but the endless distinctions between IAM,\nONE MIND and NO MIND.\nAnd how Anatta is a distinct realization.\n1\nMr. RDT\nAlbert Hong very true Al. You can often see where the people are at by how they express\nthemsleves.\n•\nAlbert Hong\nMr. RDT yeah. language is how we shape everything. Nama-Rupa. Name and form are the same.\n•\nMr. RDT\nAlbert Hong true. If people dont want to release their clinging they will often make argument along\nthe lines of \"this is (my) experience\" or \"I know this from experience\". I mean of course you do. Our\nview shapes our world.\n•\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nJT： “What Albert said about representation and presentation is very apt. There is a big difference\nin talking about:\n1. freedom from all elaborations/conceptualities -- representation and\n1058\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n2. freedom from all elaborations/conceptualities from without self-nature perspective --\npresentation.”\n2\n•\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nReminded of what i wrote in 2012\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../buddha-dharma-dream...\nBuddha-Dharma: A Dream in a Dream\n(Above: Ted Biringer's book)\nLike always, Ted Biringer have interesting and well written postings.\nJust like to add a short comment:\nDogen here relates nyo (“like”), to ze (“this”), evoking the familiar Zen association nyoze (“like this,”\n“thusness”). He goes on to draw the implication that “like this” signifies not mere resemblance but\nthe nondual identity of symbol and symbolized. He thus rejects any dualistic notion of metaphor\nor simile (hiyi), whereby an image points to, represents, or approximates something other than\nitself. Rather, for Dogen, the symbol itself is the very presence of total dynamism, i.e., it presents.\nHee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, note 8, p.251\nI could think of one example: people liken “Buddha-nature” to be “like the moon”.\nIn actuality, the very appearance of the moon is buddha-nature, it is not that there is some hidden\nthing called buddha-nature which merely resembles the moon. The moon is buddha-nature, the\nbuddha-nature is the moon, the nondual identity of symbol and symbolized. Or as Dogen says, the\nmoon-face buddha and sun-face buddha, the whole body is the whole moon. There is nothing\nhidden or latent about it, there is no hidden noumenon in which phenomenon or symbols can\n“point to” or “hint at”. The symbol, e.g. the moon, is itself the very presence of total dynamism.\nFurthermore, manifestation does not 'come from' Buddha-nature, nor does Buddha-nature\n'contains' manifestation, Buddha-nature is empty of a self but conventionally imputed on the\n\"myriad forms\". Likewise for Truth, Awareness, etc.\nIn fact everything is like this.\nScent of a flower is not scent of “a flower”, the scent does not represent or approximate something\nother than itself but is a complete reality (well not exactly a 'reality' but rather a whole and\ncomplete manifestation/appearance which is empty and unreal) in itself: the scent IS the flower,\nwheel of a car is not wheel of “a car”, the car IS the wheel. Wheel cannot be said to \"come from a\ncar\" or \"be contained by a car\". The word “car” is a mere imputation, not a true reality that can be\nestablished. “Self” and aggregates are likewise.\n1059\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nSeen in such manner, all constructs are deconstructed and what's left is just the shimmering\n\"dream-like\" (coreless, empty, illusory), luminous appearances which is all there is, but not to be\nconfused with a dreamy state.\nAnyway this is Ted's new post:\nhttp://dogenandtheshobogenzo.blogspot.sg/.../buddha...\nFriday, June 01, 2012\nBuddha-Dharma: A Dream in a Dream\nOn the True Nature of the Self...\nThe final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else.\nThe exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly.\nWallace Stevens\nThe appearance of buddhas and ancestors in the world, being prior to the emergence of any\nincipient sign, has nothing to do with old, narrow opinions. This accounts for the virtues of\nbuddha-ancestors, as of going beyond the Buddha. Unconcerned with time, the life-span [of\nbuddha-ancestors] is neither prolonged nor momentary, as it is far from the comprehension of\nordinary minds.\nThe ever turning wheel of the Dharma is also a principle prior to the emergence of any incipient\nsign; as such, it is an eternal paragon with immeasurably great merit. [Buddha-ancestors] expound\nthis as a dream in a dream. Because they see verification within verification, it is known as\nexpounding a dream in a dream.\nThe place where a dream is expounded in a dream is indeed the land and assembly of buddha-\nancestors. The buddha-land and buddha-assembly, the ancestral way and ancestral seat, are all\nverification founded upon verification, hence all are the expounding of a dream in a dream. Upon\nencountering their utterances and discourses, do not think that these are not of the buddha-\nassembly; they are the Buddha’s turning the wheel of the Dharma. Because this wheel of the\nDharma turns in all directions, the great oceans and Mt. Sumeru, the lands and buddhas are all\nrealized. Such is expounding a dream in a dream, which is prior to all dreams.\nThe entire world, crystal-clear everywhere, is a dream; and a dream is all grasses [things] clear and\nbright. To doubt the dream state is itself to dream; all perplexity is a dream as well. At this very\nmoment, [all are] grasses of the “dream state,” grasses “in” [a dream], grasses“expounding” [a\ndream], and so on. Even as we study this, the very roots and stalks, leaves and branches, flowers\nand fruits, lights and hues [of our perception] are all a great dream. Never mistake this, however,\nfor a dreamy state.\nDogen, Shobogenzo, Muchu-setsumu (Expounding a dream in a dream), Trans.

Only it hurts.\nJoseph Campbell, The Power of Myth (with Bill Moyers)\nDogen here relates nyo (“like”), to ze (“this”), evoking the familiar Zen association nyoze (“like this,”\n“thusness”). He goes on to draw the implication that “like this” signifies not mere resemblance but\nthe nondual identity of symbol and symbolized. He thus rejects any dualistic notion of metaphor\n1060\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nor simile (hiyi), whereby an image points to, represents, or approximates something other than\nitself. Rather, for Dogen, the symbol itself is the very presence of total dynamism, i.e., it presents.\nHee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, note 8, p.251\nIf the new empirical results are taken seriously, then people throughout our culture have to\nrethink some of their most cherished beliefs about what science and philosophy are and consider\ntheir values from a new perspective...\nIf conceptual metaphors are real, then all literalist and objective views of meaning and knowledge\nare false. We can no longer pretend to build an account of concepts and knowledge on objective,\nliteral foundations.

But in\nlight of the understanding of emptiness, we can now delineate four levels of The Place Where There is No\nHeat and Cold.\n1) No cold and heat as either nirodha samapatti or nirvikalpa samadhi (forms of non\nanalytical cessation)\nNirodha Samapatti and Nirvikalpa Samadhi are different, but both belong to the category of non-\nanalytical cessations. In Kevala Nirvikalpa Samadhi, all sensory input and mental concepts are shut, only a\nformless Awareness remains. With training in meditative absorption, one can abide in Nirvikalpa Samadhi\n‘at will’ in the I AM phase, and if the I AM Presence remains uninterrupted even in daily living it is\nconsidered ‘Sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi’ (although some explanations of Sahaja implies it is the realization\nof One Mind). In my understanding, I AM realization fits the criteria for Sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi since\nthere is no longer the sense that the I AM can be lost after Self-Realization, even amidst the chaos of daily\nlife. The formless absorption in Nirvikalpa Samadhi merely serves to intensify the experience of I AM by\nshutting off other sensory input and concepts, but one’s realization of Self remains unshaken even\nwithout entering into a special state of samadhi after the I AM realization.\nWhereas, in Nirodha Samapatti (an attainment discussed in the Pali Suttas and Theravada Buddhism at\nlength), as well as MCTB Fruition/Burmese Style cessation, as well as John Tan Stage 3 (Entering into\nNothingness), even consciousness is shut and any form of awareness of 'anything' is experienced only\nafter emerging from that state. However, both are temporary forms of absorption and does not entail the\nliberation from one’s afflictions and causes of affliction (known as taints, kleshas, etc).\nThese samadhi states - Nirodha Samapatti, Nirvikalpa samadhi, Fruitions, John Tan Stage 3, etc are\nvarious forms of non-analytical cessations.\n1063\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nWhat is the difference between analytical and non-analytical cessation? Analytical cessation (i.e. Nirvana)\nrefers to the permanent cessation of the emotional afflictions, primarily passion, aggression and delusion,\nand their latent tendencies giving rise to these afflictions through the release and cessation of ignorance\nthrough prajna wisdom (the realization and actualization of anatta and emptiness).\nHere’s an excerpt from https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Cessation\n“Cessation is of two kinds:\nanalytical (Skt. pratisaṃkhyā-nirodha; Tib. སོ་སོར་བརྟགས་པའི་འགོག་པ་, sosor takpé gokpa, Wyl. so sor brtags pa'i 'gog\npa) and\nnon-analytical (Skt. apratisaṃkhyā-nirodha; Tib. བརྟགས་མིན་འགོག་པ་, tak min gokpa, Wyl. brtags min 'gog pa).\nIn his commentary to Mipham Rinpoche’s Khenjuk, Khenpo Nüden writes:\nAnalytical cessation\nThis is the unconditioned aspect of the permanent elimination of destructive emotions and other factors\nto be eliminated, through the force of developing realization of the undefiling path, such as the wisdom of\ndiscernment, within the mind.\nNon-analytical cessation\nThis does not refer to the ceasing of latent habitual tendencies as a result of analysis and investigation,\nbut rather to the absence of a given thing in a particular place due to an incompleteness of necessary\ncauses and conditions, as in the case of horns on a horse’s head, for instance. Another example which is\nmentioned in the commentaries is the fact that other types of consciousness do not arise when the eye-\nconsciousness is distracted by a visual form. This also includes all the various forms of non-existence (or\nabsence), such as the absence of a vase in a particular place.”\n2) No cold and heat as cold and heat is subsumed into Pure Subjectivity\nIn systems such as Advaita Vedanta, the objectivity of all phenomena are deconstructed and subsumed\ninto the Pure Subjectivity of pure consciousness. However, Pure Consciousness remains inherently\nexisting and unchanging substratum and substance of everything, just like gold is the substance of\nnecklace. In Advaita, “The world is illusory, Brahman alone is real, Brahman is the world.” - Shankara. The\nworld as a superimposition of name and form is an illusion, Brahman (pure consciousness) alone is real\nas its true source and substratum, and Brahman is finally revealed to be the only substance of reality/the\nworld (the universe as Self is real). This is different from anatta as in 3). This process of deconstructing\nobjectivity and finally the collapse of the Witness into one seamless awareness results in the realization of\nOne Mind (see John Tan Stage 4).\n3) No cold and heat as where cold and heat kills you and manifests its own radiance in anatta\n1064\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAs John Tan wrote in 2013 to Mr. J, “The place where there is no earth, fire, wind, space, water… is the\nplace where the earth, fire, wind, space and water kills “You” and fully shines as its own radiance, a\ncomplete taste of itself and fully itself.” This will only become an effortless state after realization of anatta\n(John Tan Stage 5). Also see the Glossary section for “The Place Where There Is No Cold or Heat”.\n4) No cold and heat where cold and heat are thoroughly deconstructed by realizing its non-arising\nThere is no cold and heat as ‘cold’ and ‘heat’ are completely devoid of essence, empty of existing\n[inherently] by its own side. Cold and heat are mere names, empty of substantive essence. When\nsearched for, no ‘cold’ or ‘heat’ could be found to exist by its own essence.\n“Here, O Sariputra,\nall dharmas are marked with emptiness ;\nthey are not produced or stopped, not defiled or immaculate, not deficient or complete.\nTherefore, O Sariputra,\nin emptiness there is no form nor feeling, nor perception, nor impulse, nor consciousness ;\nNo eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind ; No forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables or objects of mind ;\nNo sight-organ element, and so forth, until we come to :\nNo mind-consciousness element ; There is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, and so forth, until we\ncome to : There is no decay and death, no extinction of decay and death. There is no suffering, no\norigination, no stopping, no path.\nThere is no cognition, no attainment and no non-attainment.”\n- Heart Sutra https://www.dharmanet.org/HeartSutra.htm\n\"Myriad Objects\nPreston Putzel\nVinnana anidassana would be Anatta equipoise I’m pretty sure.\nEquivalent to seeing Dependent Arising in the reverse order (with the cessation of ignorance....etc)\nAlso the same as the cessation of contact/phassa nirodha.\nSekhas access it intermittently but deviate from it due to residual/habitual self-clinging.\nArahants would never deviate from it, as I understand.\n· Reply\n· 3h\"\nMyriad Objects\nYes.\nMalcolm wrote:\nThe view is self-originated pristine consciousness, free from the extreme of the dualism of an\napprehended object and an apprehending subject.\n1065\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n— Self-Liberated Vidyā Tantra\nsrivijaya wrote:\nBrilliant quote.\nNot unlike Viññanam anidassanam from the Kevatta sutta:\nConsciousness without feature, without end, luminous all around\nhttp://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html\nMalcolm wrote:\nIt has precisely the same meaning.\nhttps://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=23141...\nAlso, John Tan, 2014:\n\"It is also important that Buddha relates a description similar to consciousness without features in Bahiya\nsutta. This is what I told Mr. J about allowing the five elements to \"kill you\" when he asked me about how I\nunderstand consciousness without features.\"\n\"Consciousness without features. See how yor answer.\nWe must know that Buddha told the bhikkhu the way the question is phrased is invalid and must be\nunderstood not as a cessation of the 4 elements without remainder.\nBut I believe Stian is not seeing that way.\nTherefore cessation/nirodha should be understood from the perspective of \"no footing\", the release\nwithout ground of the elements.\nAnd a consciousness that is so is luminous without feature\nWhere the place without heat and cold\nNot exactly no-mind but the featureless quality of groundlessness...that is you must understand the\nfeatureless quality in the experience.\"\n\"Just realized that kevatta consciousness without features is not the cessation of the 4 elements but the 4\nelements having no footing.\nYes\nVery often we say if there is no subject, how can there be object.

In fact, all sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touch,\nsensations, thoughts are no longer experienced in terms of reified self and phenomena but as the display\nof pure wisdom. The entire environment becomes pure land, as I wrote in the preface of AtR guide. Or as\nthe Vajrayana (and even Zen) teachers say, \"All appearances are the mandala of the deities, all sounds are\nthe mandala of mantra, and all thoughts are the mandala of enlightened mind. The nature of all apparent\nand existing things—of this entire world and all its beings—is the great mandala of the manifest ground,\nour basic state.\"\nThat being said, if one truly realizes I AM and deepens one's samadhi, it can be incredibly blissful, not\ndepressing at all. For example Eckhart Tolle and Ramana Maharshi just sat in parks and caves in Nirvikalpa\nSamadhi all the time absorbed in the transcendent bliss of formless Beingness after their initial Self-\nRealization. It is however directed only to the Mind sense door, unlike after nondual anatta -- all six senses\nbecomes pure and luminous, nondual perfection. Hence the practice at the I AM stage is still dissociative.\nThe I AM phase is blissful but not liberating, in fact even up to non-dual it cannot be said to be liberating\nfrom Buddhadharma POV. It can lead to even greater grasping. The passion for consciousness, the\nidentification involved (even towards an ultimate identity) is what hinders the experience of liberation.\nAnatta is the beginning of the experience of liberation and further refined with twofold emptiness.\nAfter nondual and especially anatta, one's path is total openness and integration, non dissociative. One\nexperiences Buddha-nature in all senses and manifestations and all actions are totally exerted and\nactualized.\nHowever having pure vision of all appearances is post anatta and emptiness realization. One should know\nthat while not operating in pure vision, all phenomena experienced is simply samsara and not a source of\nhappiness at all. They are appearances misperceived into phenomena -- objects with characteristics, and\n(mis)appropriated in terms of I, me, and mine, in terms of agent and action, perceiver and perceived,\nposessor and possessed. Whereas in truth all such conditioned phenomena are impermanent,\nunsatisfactory and non-self. If one seeks to find any happiness in terms of any conditioned and\nappropriated phenomena ('my cars', 'my billion dollars', 'my relationship', 'my ....'), one can never find any.\nSamsara is full of painful conditions, sickness, getting old, death, losing of loved ones and possessions,\n1067\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nsuffering happening all around in life, perhaps made more apparent by the pandemic recently, and\nespecially if you live in poverty in a third world country. Be it a beggar or a billionaire, we are all equals in\nthe face of death, which comes in a blink of an eye - with nothing we came and with nothing we shall depart.\nBut not only are these painful conditions suffering: even pleasant experiences and phenomena are\nsuffering, because according to Buddha they are the dukkha or suffering of impermanence. All conditioned\nphenomena, even pleasant ones, are ultimately transient and fleeting, subject to death, decay and\ncessation and of the nature of suffering. Your money, your youth, your beauty, your health, your\nrelationships, your human life, very soon they will be all gone. All conditioned phenomena are fleeting and\ntransient like a bubble, so how can they be any true source of happiness and refuge? The Diamond Sutra\nstates, \"A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp, An illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble, A dream, a\nlightning’s flash, a thunder cloud— This is the way one should see the conditioned.\" To think otherwise is\nto suffer from delusion, to falsely imagine that somehow finding the right things in samsara will finally offer\nus real fulfillment, which will ultimately only disappoint. It is a sign of true wisdom and maturity to finally\nrealize that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, suffering, non-self and are not fit for clinging.\nSamsara is only suffering.\n· Reply · 31m · Edited\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nAs someone posted before, \"Garab Dorje Rinpoche said that, \"Even with 5 Wisdoms, the Buddha was\nunable to find happiness in Samsara.\"\nThe Buddha himself said, \"\"Bhikkhus, all is burning. And what is the all that is burning?\n\"The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning, also whatever\nis felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact for its\nindispensable condition, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire\nof hate, with the fire of delusion. I say it is burning with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, with\nlamentations, with pains, with griefs, with despairs.\"\nNirvana is the sole happiness and bliss, which the scriptures explain is not a feeling of perpetually blissful\nsensation, but merely the cessation or absence of suffering. But this is not implying that liberation is a state\nof dissociation which I shall explain further.\nIn a sense perhaps Buddhism sounds even more 'depressing' (although it really isn't -- only perhaps to\nthose inclined towards theistic doctrine) than ACIM because it goes further than saying God doesn't create\nthe world or even know about it, it questions the existence of God itself. Buddha didn't believe in a God or\ncreator and in fact repudiates such an idea, and neither do I believe in a creator, so you can say that I am\natheist (I've heard Kyle Dixon and Acharya Malcolm state the same). Buddhists simply have a totally distinct\nparadigm, one that doesn't need a God (and so do some other Indian teachings like Samkhya and Jainism,\n1068\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nalthough Buddhism also differs from their view in many other areas). The question of suffering (why would\na benevolent God create suffering?) -- a question that the Buddha similarly raised to repudiate the whole\nnotion of a creator God -- simply does not apply to Buddhadharma at all since we in fact, being atheists,\nreject a creator God and assert that the suffering of sentient beings dependently originates based on\nignorance, afflictions and karma without any real agent/agency (whether external or internal). This is\nhowever not a hopeless situation because nirvana is the end of that suffering and there is a path to end\nthat suffering. And if you go further into the teachings of dependent origination and emptiness, then the\nvery notion of a world as existing or non-existing vanishes. All phenomena are fundamentally empty and\nnon-arisen and non-originating.\n(Staying near Sāvatthī … Then Ven. Kaccāna Gotta approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having\nbowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: “Lord, ‘Right view, right\nview,’ it is said. To what extent is there right view?”\n“By & large, Kaccāna, this world1 is supported by [takes as its object] a polarity, that of existence & non-\nexistence. But when one sees the origination2 of the world as it has come to be with right discernment,\n‘non-existence’ with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world\nas it has come to be with right discernment, ‘existence’ with reference to the world does not occur to one.3)\nThe view of Buddhadharma is nondual, free of subject and object, existence or non-existence. Heart Sutra\nsaid, \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.\" Nagarjuna said: \"25:20: nirvāṇasya ca yā koṭiḥ koṭiḥ\nThe limit of nirvana is also the limit [of samsara]\nna tayor antaraṁ kiñcit susūkśmam api vidyate |\nthere’s not the slightest detail at all found between them.\"\nNirvana is samsara rightly seen, which is not to say that samsara and nirvana are indistinguishable. As Kyle\nDixon said, \"This pointer simply means don’t look for liberation elsewhere, but samsara is not literally\nnirvana. The latter is a complete knowledge of the former.\"\nIf all conditioned phenomena are suffering, how can a Buddha be free of suffering while alive? The answer\nis simple - by apperceiving the true nature of all phenomena to be empty and non-arisen, a Buddha ceases\nto perceive conditioned phenomena. A Buddha ceases to appropriate phenomena in terms of I, me, and\nmine, and also ceases to reify phenomena in terms of characteristics. A Buddha ceases all tendencies\ntowards craving, anger, delusion.\nThe Buddha said in Kalaka Sutta, \"Thus, monks, the Tathāgata, when seeing what is to be seen, doesn’t\nsuppose an (object as) seen. He doesn’t suppose an unseen. He doesn’t suppose an (object) to-be-seen. He\ndoesn’t suppose a seer...\" - https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN4_24.html\n\"That saṁsāra is nirvāṇa is a major tenet of Mahāyāna philosophy. \"Nothing of saṁsāra is different from\n1069\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nnirvāṇa, nothing of nirvāṇa is different from saṁsāra.

So Nāgārjuna also distinguishes them: \"That which, taken as causal or\ndependent, is the process of being born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence,\ndeclared to be nirvāṇa.\" [2] There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world may be\nexperienced in two different ways. Saṁsāra is the \"relative\" world as usually experienced, in which \"I\"\ndualistically perceive \"it\" as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time. Nirvāṇa is the\nworld as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which,\nMādhyamika insists, cannot be characterized (Chandrakīrti: \"Nirvāṇa or Reality is that which is absolved of\nall thought-construction\"), but which Yogācāra nevertheless sometimes calls \"Mind\" or \"Buddhanature,\"\nand so forth.\" – Zen teacher David Loy,\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180327153119/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm\nAs Kyle Dixon wrote,\n\"To “exist” involves certain criteria that are undesirable in the sense that existent phenomena are\nconditioned by nature, and thus arise and cease.\nBuddhas have fully integrated with a complete, non-conceptual experiential knowledge of the nature of\napparently conditioned phenomena, thus for a Buddha, conditioned phenomena no longer appear,\nbecause they were rooted in delusion. Buddhas are completely free of delusion.\nTherefore to address your question, since Buddhas do not conceive of or perceive conditioned phenomena,\nthey do not conceive or perceive of existence in appearances.\nThis does not mean they are inert and unconscious, they are indeed conscious and awake, but they see\nappearances like a dream. We would not say the tiger who attacks you in a dream actually “exists.” The tiger\ndoes appear, but it is not a substantial entity. The same goes for all phenomena of even our waking,\nconsensus reality. A Buddha sees all phenomena like a dream, and does not see phenomena as substantial\nentities that “exist.”\nA Buddha himself or herself also cannot be said to “exist” for this same reason, but they appear\nnevertheless.\"\nAN 4:24 Kāḷaka Sutta | At Kāḷaka’s Park\nDHAMMATALKS.ORG\n· Reply · Remove Preview · 30m · Edited” – Soh, 2021\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/AwakeningToReality/posts/5752308824810500/\n1070\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\n“In the actual natural state objects no longer appear to be external.

Sems and sems\nbyung are both arrested and the luminosity of your nature, zangtal, becomes the prevailing modality of\nconsciousness.\nThat state is massively different in expression when compared to our relative condition.\nIt just seems to me that you are asserting that our relative condition, with functioning mind [sems] and\nmental factors [sems byung] which perceive objects is the natural state, but it is not the natural state, it is\navidyā.\nThus, when a beginners trekchö practice is referred to as being in the “natural state” it is just a nominal\nnatural state, not the actual awakened natural state.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\nWrong Understanding of Emptiness as Nihilism (Everything Doesn’t Exist):\nIn response to someone, Soh explained that emptiness does not mean non-existence of\nphenomena/suffering, “Denying suffering and asserting that there is no end to suffering is nihilism. If you\nrealize emptiness, you also see dependent arising and the four noble truths. Then you realize that four\nnoble truths is the right view, that there is suffering, cause of suffering, the end of suffering and the path\nto end suffering, but all these are seen via dependent origination and not via the false view of essence, self,\nor agency. Meaning, you do not see suffering as existing in and of itself independent of the conditions that\ngive rise to suffering. Nor do you think suffering arise merely via the agency of a Self or controller. Although\nsuffering appears, it is both empty/non-arisen and dependently originating, and without self/Self/agent.\nThen, you discern clearly the causes and conditions for the arising of suffering and also the remedy. If you\ninterpret emptiness in terms of nihilism and non-existence, then the antidote has turned into a poison and\nthere is no cure.”\n\"There never was a self. One must re-orientate oneself that it is functionality and action that give rise to\n[the sense of a] self/entity rather than [a real] agent giving rise to action. Therefore from anatta, we see\nDependent Origination, cause and conditions, action, karma... unlike [the misunderstanding of] no-self\ntherefore no dependent origination and causality. The former is non-substantialist view, the later is using\nsubstantialist self view to understand anatta (no-self).\" - John Tan, 2015\n\"Seeing afflictive Dependent Origination is enlightened view because one sees Dependent Origination.\nThere is no [insight into] afflictive Dependent Origination for sentient beings, there is [the conceiving of a]\nSelf/self... they do not see Dependent Origination.\" - John Tan, 2014\n“Non-arising [anutpāda] is a synonym for emptiness [śūnyatā] and is the heart of Madhyamaka.\nNihilism [ucceda] is the negation of convention, the negation of appearance, or the reification of non-\nexistence [abhāva].\n1071\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nNon-arising is not equivalent to any of those positions.\nIn his Madhyamakālaṃkāra, Śantarakṣita states:\n\"Therefore, the tathāgatas have said\n‘All phenomena do not arise’ because this conforms with the ultimate. This ‘ultimate.’ in reality, is free\nfrom all proliferation. Because there is no arising and so on, nonarising and so on isn't possible, because\nits entity has been negated.\"\n- Kyle Dixon\n“In the passages above, the Abhidharma opponent is saying that if Nagarjuna is right about \"emptiness,\"\nthen the very practices that make Buddhism soteriologically efficacious will be destroyed. That is, if it is true\nthat the Four Noble Truths are \"empty,\" then there is no such thing as the Buddha, the Dharma, and the\nSangha, no such thing as impermanence, \"non-self,\" and nirvana, and the practices that supposedly lead\nto liberation will be destroyed. Nagarjuna responds to the opponent by saying that he has misunderstood\n\"emptiness\":\nWe say that this understanding of yours\nOf emptiness and purpose of emptiness\nAnd of the significance of emptiness is incorrect.\nAs a consequence you are harmed by it.\n(Garfield 1995, p.68)\nBecause the opponent has taken \"emptiness\" to signify the nonexistence of the Four Noble Truths, he is\n\"harmed by it\"-in other words, he sees \"emptiness\" as destructive. But his reason for thinking of\n\"emptiness\" in this way is that he thinks that a \"correct\" meditation on causality, the aggregates, and the\nFour Noble Truths is necessary for liberation.\nNagarjuna responds to this assumption by reversing the tables and saying, in effect, that it is not\n\"emptiness\" that destroys practice, but the very idea that such things as causality, the aggregates, and the\nFour Noble Truths are \"inherent,\" essential, or necessary:\nIf you perceive the existence of all things\nIn terms of svabhava,\nThen this perception of all things\nWill be without the perception of causes and conditions.\nEffects and causes\nAnd agent and action\nAnd conditions and arising and ceasing\n1072\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nAnd effects will be rendered impossible.\n(Garfield 1995, p.69)\nP.572\nNagarjuna goes on to say that the reason essences militate against causal conditions, arising, ceasing,\nagency, and so forth is that the idea of essence entails independence, and if things are by nature\nindependent then it is impossible for them to interact causally. If this is true then there is no \"dependent\narising,\" and without \"dependent arising\" it is impossible to make sense of the ability to cultivate a virtuous\nlife. In other words, without the process of change the whole idea of cultivating the \"fruits\" of a Buddhist\nlife is rendered nonsensical. Nagarjuna responds by saying that Buddhist praxis must be \"empty\" if we are\nto make any sense of the Four Noble Truths:\nIf dependent arising is denied,\nEmptiness itself is rejected.\nThis would contradict\nAll of the worldly conventions.\nIf emptiness is rejected,\nNo action will be appropriate.\nThere would be action which did not begin,\nAnd there would be agent without action.\nIf there is svabhava, the whole world\nWill be unarising, unceasing,\nAnd static. The entire phenomenal world\nWould be immutable.\nIf it (the world) were not empty,\nThen action would be without profit.\nThe act of ending suffering and\nAbandoning misery and defilement would not exist.\n(Garfield 1995, p.72)” - How Experiential Realization Helps in Liberation\nChandrakirti:\n\"If you regard things as existent by virtue of (a reified) intrinsic reality, you thereby regard them as bereft\nof causes and conditions. And thereby you are condemning effects, causes, agents, actions, activities,\noriginations, cessations, and even fruitional goals. Whatever is relativity we proclaim that emptiness.\nNothing whatsoever is found which is not relativistically originated. Therefore, nothing whatsoever is\n1073\nSTAGE 6: The Nature of Presence is Empty (“Sunyata / Secondfold Emptiness”)\nfound which is not empty. So if all things were not empty, there would be no origination and no\ndestruction.”\n“EMPTINESS DEVIATING TO THE BASIC NATURE\nTimeless Deviation to the Nature of Knowables The meditation of inseparable phenomena and emptiness\nis called “emptiness endowed with the supreme aspect.” Not knowing how emptiness and\ninterdependence abide in nonduality, you decide that emptiness is a nothingness that has never existed\nand that is not influenced at all by qualities or defects. Then you underestimate the cause and effect of\nvirtue and vice, or else lapse exclusively into the nature of all things being originally pure, primordially\nfree, and so forth. Bearing such emptiness, the relative level of interdependence is not mastered. In this\nrespect, this is what is known as mahamudra: one’s basic nature is unoriginated and, since it is neither\nexistent nor nonexistent, eternal nor nil, true nor false, nor any other such aspects, it has no existence\nwhatsoever. Nonetheless, its unceasing radiance arises as the relative level of all kinds of\ninterdependence, so it is known as emptiness having the core of interdependence and interdependence\nhaving the nature of emptiness. Therefore, emptiness does not stray to the nature of knowables. In the\nFundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way it is said: Anything that doesn’t arise dependently Is a phenomenon\nthat has no existence. Therefore anything that is not empty Is a phenomenon that has no existence. And as said\nin the Commentary on Bodhichitta: It is taught that the relative plane is emptiness, And emptiness alone is the\nrelative plane.” – The Royal Seal of Mahamudra, Volume 2, Khamtrul Rinpoche\n“level 7\nkrodha\n· 6h\n“We can’t say there’s non-existence because there’s still cognizance (wisdom)... but this cognizance has no\nsubstantial existence or basis, it’s empty”\n[Krodha/Kyle Dixon:] That lack of substantial existence actually lends to the Dzogchen teachings and\nluminaries often referring to such things as med par gsal snang “clearly apparent non-existent” or “non-\nexistent clear appearance.”\nThus don’t be timid to say these things are ultimately non-existent, the fact that we acknowledge that they\nappear means we avoid nihilism.\nFor example, Longchenpa in the chos dbyings mdzod auto-commentary:\nThough there is nothing established as internal or external, the reflected appearances are understood through\nthe eight examples of illusion. Though designated as dharmatā, dharmin, and so on, a great, clear appearance\nthat does not exist is asserted in this tradition of the Great Perfection.\n5\n1074\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously\nPerfected\nNon-dual luminosity, anatta, empty nature, are spontaneously manifesting, self-arising and emerging\nnaturally and every actualized sight, sound, form, experience blossoms into lotus (wisdom) on its own\nwithout dualistic effort.\n“After cycles and cycles of refining our practice and insights, we will come to this realization:\nAnatta is a seal, not a stage.\nAwareness has always been non-dual.\nAppearances have always been Non-arising.\nAll phenomena are ‘interconnected’ and by nature Maha.\nAll are always and already so.\nOnly dualistic and inherent views are obscuring these experiential facts and therefore what is really needed\nis simply to experience whatever arises openly and unreservedly (See section \"On Spontaneous Perfection\").\nHowever this does not denote the end of practice; practice simply moves to become dynamic and\nconditions-manifestation based. The ground and the path of practice become indistinguishable.” - John Tan,\n2009\n“Spontaneous perfection to me refers to the 3 tastes of my practice (Soh: Anatta, +A and -A) that I mentioned\nare spontaneously perfected. It is just effortless and ongoing expression from there on. Practice just take\nanother form as I stated in the article - practice-enlightenment.” - John Tan, 2013\n“If we want to fully realize the inexpressible, be willing to give up all centers and point of references that\nmanifests in the form of ‘who’, ‘when’ and ‘where’. Just give up the entire sense of self then instantly all\nthings are spontaneously perfected.” - John Tan, 2009\n“John TanMonday, February 10, 2014 at 1:45pm UTC+08\nLongchenpa is not talking about no realization. He is talking about realization is not the cause of liberation.\nFor phenomena has always been in the state of nirvana, how can realization cause freedom. But many will\ntake it that no realization is needed. But for one that realizes 2 folds [twofold emptiness], this view that\nrealization is needed or realization causes freedom must be abandoned. For it hinders natural perfection.\nThat is why after 2 folds, this view of perfection is important. So one must turn the view into natural\nperfection after 2 folds.”\n1075\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n“John TanFriday, December 26, 2014 at 12:24pm UTC+08\nwe can talk and talk and talk...but without seeing essencelessness from top to bottom, left to right...the\nunconditioned release and the spontaneous perfection will not dawn as actual taste....it is not necessary to\ndo analysis like in the mmk but it does help a lot especially in this modern age where the mind is so\nsophisticated...lol....it is the recognition of the \"essencelessness\" that is most crucial, once we clearly see by\nway of analysis or by way of direct insight of the relationships between essencelessness, freedom, grasping,\nnatural manifestation and spontaneity....and continue to authenticate the truth in activities… when non-\ndual essencelessness as it is dawn...everything and every action will be free, perfect and unmade.”\n“John TanFriday, January 2, 2015 at 11:21am UTC+08\nAfter certain phase, a practitioner must turn the view towards natural perfection but people don't like to\nhear that.

It sounds logical therefore all the more it should be pointed out correctly.

If it is realized that though manifestation\nappears, it never was truly there so even \"disappearance\" too is illusion.\nTherefore I like \"mere designation\" so much because it completely brings out this taste.\nBut all these are just -A. Next is to look at +A. It is exactly the same again but this round non-conceptual\nappearance and dependent arising is brought to be seen and understood at the conventional level.\nSo it is understanding the nature of experience… not just directly experiencing awareness.\nAfter this practice is no practice… just complete non-dual releasing… natural and spontaneous. When\nessencelessness is thoroughly seen through, the way of practice can only be spontaneous presence and\nnatural perfection.

Pais\nJohn Tan\nI wonder exactly what the difference is between DO and spontaneous presence. In a way, DO seems\nmore intellectual, inferential and more into the aproximate ultimate (emptiness as negation). That's been\npart of my difficulty with the term \"total exertion\" - it seems to invite a conceptualization of a whole web of\ncausality that arises as \"this moment.\"\nOn the other hand, lately DO (and by extension total exertion) is taking the shape of \"vivid radiance,\" or\n\"spontaneous clarity.\" DO means that there is clarity (origination), but it is spontaneous (dependent and\nthus empty - initially as negation, but finally as non-referentiality, beyond notions and \"pure\").\nI've been trying to connect the dots between \"nature of mind\" - which feels rather sujective and \"in here\"\n- and the whole Madhyamaka enterprise of emptiness and DO - which feels rather objective and \"out there.\"\nWhen investigating the nature of mind, one usually tries to look within, kind of turning the attention\n1078\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nbackwards; when investigating DO, one may knock on a table, drop a pen, etc., checking the inexorable \"law\nof causality\" - when this is, that is.\nBut what's coming up to me is that the \"nature of mind\" - as inseparable clarity and\nemptiness/unobstructedness - is nothing but the dependently arisen nature of experience/appearances.\nFrom the openness and referencelessness of mind, vivid appearances \"naturally\" manifest - and this is\nnothing but DO (\"naturally\" paradoxically means \"when conditions are present\").\nMadhyamaka, when stressing the union of the two truths as inseparable union of appearance and\nemptiness, seems to be opening the same door that Mahamudra and Dzogchen seem to be opening with\nthe nature of mind as inseparable emptiness, clarity and responsiveness/ expression/ compassion.\nThis is what I was trying to convey in a recent post in AtR:\nThe two truths meet everywhere.\n.\n- Dependent origination refutes\nboth extreme views of is and is-not.\n- Appearance and emptiness are united\nas the scent that is experience.\n- Clarity and limitlessness are inseparable\nas the nature of mind.\n.\nMind as clarity is nothing\nbut experience as appearingness.\nExperience as emptiness is nothing\nbut limitlessness as mind.\n.\nClarity-appearance is nothing but origination.\nEmpty-limitlessness is nothing but dependency.\nThe diving into the nature of mind is nothing\nbut the embracing of dependent origination.\n.\nA feather slowly floats its way towards the ground;\nThe breeze makes the trees sway;\nA sound suddenly pierces the silence;\nThat itself is the nature of mind.\n.\nThe very pulsing of dependent origination\nis the primordial face of the Tathāgata.\nLike blood and veins and heart\n- the two truths meet everywhere.\n·\nReply\n1079\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n· 2h\nAndré A. Pais\nStian Gudmundsen Høiland\n·\nReply\n· 2h\nJohn Tan\nAndré A. Pais\nTo me when spontaneous presence is expressed conventionally, it is expressed as dependent origination\nand emptiness.\nI m glad that you have understood total exertion this way. In seeing for examples, it is not only the eyes\nthat sees, the ears, the hairs, the entire body-mind-enviroment are fully exerted and participating into the\nact of seeing. How is this possible if eyes, ears, nose, environment...everything are truly established and\nnot merely conventional? If their conventionalities are not seen through, going beyond their designated\nboundaries into just the \"seen\" as the \"lurid scenery\" will just be another experience, not an insight.\nAlthough integration of two truth is crucial, I think the difference must still be made on spontaneous\npresence from freedom of conceptual notions and DO and emptiness before integration. At least until\ncertain experiential insights arise:\nOne is the supreme purity that relinquishes both pure and impurity, freedom from both notions. Without\ngoing through this process, it is difficult to \"see\" how notions create \"things\" and \"existence\".\nWhen we affirm \"internality\", we are in fact affirming \"externality\" at the same time. This is what the mind\ncan't see easily. Surely the mind thinks \" 'internal and private and in here' are still undeniably true even\nwithout designated conceptual constructs\". This undeniable conviction of \"in here\" is real and\n\"undeniably exist\" WITHOUT conceptual constructs is the \"inherentness\" that must be deconstructed. For\nwithout \"externality\", how does the sense of \"internality\" arise? If they are dependent, how could they\nexist truly? This is clearly elucidated in Mipham commentary on Shantarakahita's Madhyamakalankara,\n71a and 72b:\n71a\nProduction and the rest have no reality,\nThus non-production and the rest are equally impossible.\n72b\nEven \"non-production,\" entertained conceptually,\nIs relative and is not ultimate.\nWhen how conceptual notions create confusions aren't clear, distinguishing mere appearances from\nadded imputation on mere appearance will not be easy for the mind. Like why is the plant growing\ninstead of decaying? At which point exactly is it growing or decaying? Same applies to cause and effect.\nSimilar to analogy of the plant that grows and decays, the designated (Soh: designating?) consciousness\ndetermines that a cause has ceased and effect has come into \"existence\".\n1080\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nThis emphasis of the thorough understanding of conceptual notions to be negated instead of creating\n\"inherent existence\" on top of the conventional is why Mipham said Tsongkhapa emptiness is notional\nemptiness. We do not empty the \"inherent existence\" of the vase, the entire conventional notion of \"vase\"\nis the \"inherent existence\" to be emptied, there is no \"extra\" inherent existence of something to be\nemptied. You can't retain the conventionality of vase and talk about emptiness. So essentially it is freeing\nentirely from conceptual thoughts; however unlike mere suppression of thoughts or non-analytical\ncessation, the uprooting is deep, thorough and imbued with prajna.\nBut does freedom from conceptualities deny vivid appearances, deny regularities? No -- that is why it is\ndependent origination and emptiness. However after going through the process and back relooking at\nconventionalities, we do not see inherentness, agencies initiating actions, existence and non-existence\nand separations in the vivid non-dual display of causal functioning.\nNext is the freedom from all notions will lead one into another taste -- unmade, unconditioned, natural\nspontaneity in contrast to artificially man-made mind constructs.\nOnce natural clarity, supreme purity, unconditioned natural spontaneity are realized via seeing through\nconventionalities, then I think integrating the two truth will be more fruitful.\n7\n• Like\n• ·\nReply\n• · 3w\n• ·\nEdited\n• ·\nJohn Tan\nAndré A.

Spontaneous\nperfection is not about the path we adopt, it is that ultimate and thorough insight that allows us to willingly,\nfearlessly and unreservedly open to whatever that arises; for whatever arises is always [in its nature] to\nliberate itself when experienced as non-dual and empty awareness.” - John Tan, 2009\n1085\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n“Knowing mind (clarity) is not knowing the nature of mind and the nature of mind is not for knowing nor\ncan it be known, learned or studied, that is why it is purging of all views. It can however be expressed as a\nnegation of all inherent-ness. Free from all substantialities and extremes, there is just unconditioned\nexpression in natural spontaneity. Like the previous texts you posted about the \"one life\". I think I have\ndiscussed this with you before in our early conversations.\nWe must differentiate and discern experience free from a background and source. What happened when\nthe background is gone? There is the non-doership aspect and the luminous clarity aspect. Ascribing all as\nlife is an extrapolation as I told you before. There is no need to create an alternate source call \"one life\".\nThe experience as being lived by and expression of life is just an experience of non-doership due to freedom\nfrom background source. However one must still be able to discern correct what is unconditioned\nexpression and what is karmic habituation.” - John Tan, 2019\n“[5:27 PM, 12/30/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Was meditating outside\n[5:28 PM, 12/30/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Then I reached a state where mind body was dropped and tranquilized\nand numb.. then suddenly i entered a blissful state and suddenly it became very clearly apparent that the\nunion of appearance and dependent arising is spontaneous presence.. the whole universe is spontaneously\npresencing and wonderful without a trace of self.. no effort or practice is required just complete dying to\nspontaneous presencing\n[5:29 PM, 12/30/2019] Soh Wei Yu: Union of empty appearance and dependent arising*\n[5:30 PM, 12/30/2019] John Tan: Very good\n[5:33 PM, 12/30/2019] John Tan: The term \"dependent arising\" understood from direct experience as the\nmanifestation of appearances.

It is not a resting point or\nanything in particular because resting points are not spontaneous, nor is it some kind of affirmative\nnegation because no inherent entities are affirmed.\nThis is not spoken in Madhyamika, but I think Dzogchen and Mahamudra speaks of it.\nArcaya Malcolm pointed out in December last year that Lhundrup (spontaneous presence) is the hidden\nmeaning of prajnaparamita.\nAlso:\n“Trekcho is to simply acknowledge that one's innate essence is empty. Togal is to recognize that the natural\ndisplay is spontaneously present. They are not our creation; they are not produced by practice. There is no\nimagining of anything in either Trekcho or Togal.”\n“To accomplish a deity, you must know the nature of the deity you are trying to accomplish. This is called\n'identifying the deity to be accomplished'. The names, colors and attributes may differ, but a deity is actually\nthe unity of primordial purity and spontaneous pres- ence. In this way, development and completion are\nalso contained within Trekcho and Togal.”\n- Vajra Speech\nJohn Tan told me on October last year\n“Actually there are two words that can fully expressed when conceptual constructs are seen through. If\nyou can tell me, that will be good. Rest to me is nonsense...lol\nAlways non-conceptual here and there... headache. Better to keep quiet and continue your practice, less\nengagement in all these.”\nLater I discovered that the two words are precisely spontaneous presence which John confirmed. I also\nshowed John those passages above which he liked.”\n\"Has awareness stood out? There is no concentration needed. When six entries and exits are pure and\nprimordial, the unconditioned stands shining, relaxed and uncontrived, luminous yet empty. The purpose\nof going through the 7 phases of perception shift is for this... Whatever arises is free and uncontrived, that\nis the supreme path. Whatever arises has never left their nirvanic state... ... your current mode of practice\n1087\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n[after those experiential insights] should be as direct and uncontrived as possible. When you see nothing\nbehind and magical appearances are too empty, awareness is naturally lucid and free. Views and all\nelaborations dissolved, mind-body forgotten... just unobstructed awareness. Awareness natural and\nuncontrived is supreme goal. Relax and do nothing, Open and boundless, Spontaneous and free, Whatever\narises is fine and liberated, This is the supreme path. Top/bottom, inside/outside, Always without center\nand empty (2-fold emptiness), Then view is fully actualized and all experiences are great liberation.\" - John\nTan, 2012\n“There's absolutely no need to attempt to bring anything whatsoever, presence, witnessing, whatever, into\nsleep or any states (waking, dreaming, and deep sleep). Any dualistic effort is a form of doing. Bringing in a\nwatcher is karma. All dharmas, all phenomena, are fundamentally quiescent as nirvana, fundamentally\nnon-arising and naturally manifesting as one's own state of radiance. Therefore true practice is resting in\nthe natural, spontaneous perfection of luminosity and emptiness. Practice becomes dynamic rather than\ntechnique-bound as the spontaneous unfolding or self-arising of all displays, activities, sounds, colors,\nsensations, gets auto-actualized as the wisdom of luminous-emptiness. Everything arises as the state of\nmeditation, which is non-meditation. Yet this requires anatta and emptiness insight as prerequisite.” - Soh,\n2018\nIn the words of Ch’an Master Hsiang-yen: “At one stroke I forgot all my knowledge!

But that is very high attainment...lol. easy to say, need aeons of life of 修为 [cultivation]。\nNatural state is non-practice.

However 99.9% of\nus are not there… lol” - John Tan, 2019\nJohn Tan advised me to study Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching. (However, not many good English translations are\navailable, though he commented before that John Chalmers’ and Richard Wilhelm’s translations are quite\ngood)\n“It is important to note here that spontaneous perfection is the result of deeply penetrating into the non-\ndual luminosity, anatta, and empty/non-arising nature of mind/phenomena as always already so, by nature\nso, spontaneously perfected. If one thinks that one can skip Phases 1 to 6 and enter straight into 7, they\nare almost certainly, 99.999% of the case deluded, are stuck in the lower stages thinking those are final,\nmissing some crucial elements of insight (how many countless people I’ve seen that are stuck at I AM or\n1088\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nOne Mind thinking that is spontaneous perfection!), or have the calibre of very rare types of saints and\nsages that belong to the realm of legends and fairy tales.” - Soh, 2019\n“Spontaneous perfection is not about negating dependent origination. In fact dependent origination and\nemptiness must be realised.\nIf there is the slightest sense that there is an experiencer and something to be experienced (luminosity,\nnondual, anatta, emptiness), then one has not realised and actualised spontaneous perfection. If there is\nthe slightest dualistic effort it is not spontaneous perfection. However that does not mean you cannot\npractice concentration and mindfulness after spontaneous perfection, rather, you no longer practice\ndualistically in order to experience something separate from yourself in the past or future. It does not mean\nthat there’s no need for practice or no need for right effort, but practice becomes dynamic actualization.\nFor example - the lightning just flashed and the thunder roars. If I try to recapture that lightning flash and\nattempt to experience more of it, more of its radiance and emptiness, then I have split myself off from the\nimmediate experience, I have established an experiencer and experience, a meditator and object of\nmeditation. This is different from practice-enlightenment where each activity is the total exertion of all\nexistence-time but instantly cast off without a trace. This practice actualization transcends meditator and\nmeditation, it transcends dualistic practice where one imagines oneself to be a subjective experiencer\naiming to attain an objective experience in the far off future. In practice actualization the immediate is the\nultimate.\nAfter realizing anatta, you see that there is no beyond. Nothing beyond this breath that is the total exertion\nof the cosmos. Nothing to attain, no beyond, only the utter perfection and completion of this actualized-\nform, where each step, each breath is none other than the utter perfection actualized in its immediacy.\nAwakening/buddha-nature/etc is not in some distant imaginary future, it is this actualized-form in its utter\nperfection.\nAny attempt to be more nondual, be more “anatta” or be more “empty” is already the propensities of\nignorance in action, and the lack of the deep realization and actualization that anatta is always already so,\nand that all dharmas are already fundamentally quiescent and non-arising in nirvana. The slightest attempt\nto bridge an imaginary gap is already a sign of ignorance. The slightest attempt to capture an experience is\nalready a sign of ignorance that imputes intrinsic phenomena and characteristics.\nI wrote yesterday:\nI do not experience an inherently existing physical universe, nor do I experience an inherently existing\nawareness/Self/Brahman. I experience a fourth alternative (to the normal, spiritual/metaphysical, physical).\nMy direct experience is without a who, where, or when, and yet there is not just blankness or nothing. I\nthink spontaneous presencing is a good term. That spontaneous and seamless presencing is not generated\n1089\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nby a self/Self and yet is not ‘inherently there in and of itself’, rather it is spontaneously presencing via total\nexertion (conventionally expressed as dependent origination or conditionality), empty and luminous. It is\nnot some self-existing metaphysical presence, Absolute or Being, nor is spontaneous presencing a formless\nentity - whatever arises is spontaneous presencing, always seen, heard, tasted and experienced. What that\nis not seen, not heard and not experienced, is merely our conceptual idea of what “Presence” is. Neither is\nspontaneous presencing an inherently existing universe, nor is spontaneous presence manifesting\ncauselessly/randomly/by chance, rather that spontaneous presencing is none other than the Maha\n(great/boundless) total exertion of the seamless conditions of the three times and ten directions, however\nit is not a linear causality where cause and effect are strictly separate with an actor (cause) and acted-upon\n(effect). As Dogen said, “Cause is not before and effect is not after.” and John Tan wrote in 2013, “Do you\nfeel being caused or effected? It is just a single flow. Now when we see one, the 10000 things arise”. You\ncan say what I experience (there is no ‘I’) is a spontaneous presencing that is none other than a seamlessly\ninterdependent, radiant and empty universe.” - Soh, 2019\nSoh:\n“https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=38591&p=608447#p608447\nMalcolm:\nI doubt very much that Karl is an annihilationist. You have really misunderstood his point, quite grievously.\nWhat he and the karmapas are implying is that there never were sentient beings to begin with. This is not\ncontroversial. Haribhadra, a Madhyamaka, points out than when one realizes buddhahood, one realizes\ntoo there was never a time when one was not a buddha. This insight does not depend on the Buddhanature\ndoctrine at all, since it is straight out of the PP Sutras. Moreover, it is commonly stated that from the point\nof the view of the result, Buddhas only perceive other Buddhas, they do not perceive sentient beings,\nbecause to perceive obscurations would equal being obscured. Buddhas have no obscurations, hence they\ndo not perceive them, ergo, they have no perception of sentient beings at all. Thus is another reason why\nHaribhadra points out that the path is entirely illusory from beginning to end, including the attainment of\nbuddhahood.\nSoh: sounds like what andre would say\nalso reminds me of my insight where i saw there are no buddhas vs sentient beings, or stages at all.. only\nspontaneous perfection. in terms of ultimate\n[11:30 pm, 17/11/2021] John Tan: Actually in ultimate view, there is not any form of apprehension,\nspontaneous perfection has no perception.\n[11:31 pm, 17/11/2021] John Tan: But if it is expressed this way it will be misunderstood as nihilistic.\noic..\nHave you ever wondered why instantaneous and sudden enlightenment is possible?\n1090\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nthe nature of mind is always so.. thats why realisation is sudden\nYes”\n….\nAlso by Malcolm: I did. I know Karl. I am sure Karl is quite sure he exists, conventionally speaking, and is\nequally confident he will realize buddhahood eventually, that his rosary of moments of empty clarity, the\nall-basis, will continue through the state of Vajradharahood, once his adventitious obscurations are\neliminated. What he is talking about is the consequences, as he sees it, of the point of view of Karmapa III\nand VIII. But as I outline above, this is not the radical departure you imagine it to be.\nYour idea is the radical misunderstanding of what he is saying.\n~ Possible Dangers and Sidetracks\n~Thinking one is there when one isn’t. As explained earlier, you need complete maturity of non-dual, anatta\nand emptiness wisdom, without which all notions of ‘spontaneous perfection’ simply leads to swimming in\na sea of delusion, laziness and apathy, letting one’s habitual tendencies and delusions run amok\n“spontaneously”, leading nowhere. Many people talk about spontaneous perfection even at Stage 1 or even\nprior to Stage 1. This only causes great harm to themselves and others.\n~Nihilistic misinterpretation of spontaneous perfection: thinking that there is no practice after spontaneous\nperfection, a wrong understanding of non-doing. The correct understanding should be practice-\nenlightenment. It is not an excuse for laziness and inactivity or letting our habitual and karmic propensities\nrun wild, mistaking that as a form of “spontaneity”. (Spontaneity is rather referring to the non-arising, empty\nnature and non-dual luminosity being ‘spontaneously perfected’ by its own accord in all manifest and\nactualized forms as there is no more trace of doubt that all arising are by nature so). Worse still, some\npeople fall into the extremes of nihilism, thinking that “my lust is spontaneously perfected, my anger is\nspontaneously perfected, my malice and violence and other unwholesome behaviours are spontaneously\nperfected” and so on, thinking that because all manners of afflictions are already spontaneously perfected,\nthere is no need for practice at all.\nIt is important to understand that all vehicles and teachings of Buddhadharma, from Theravada to Zen to\nDzogchen and Mahamudra is about liberation from sufferings and emotional afflictions, even if the exact\nmeans, method and approaches may differ somewhat. The actualization of the spontaneous perfection of\nwisdom will lead to the self-liberation of afflictions. The 84,000 dharma doors taught by Buddha are only\nfor the sole purpose of the pacification and liberation of the three poisons of passion, aggression and\ndelusion. If one does not experience this liberation, all notions of spontaneous perfection or emptiness or\nanatta is merely intellectual and conceptual (it does not mean that once anatta is initially realized all\nafflictions are immediately 100% gone all the time, but it should be the beginning of experiencing liberation\n1091\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nin real-time). A wrong and nihilistic grasp of spontaneous perfection and emptiness is not only useless, it is\nworse than useless and often causes great harm and prevents progress. I have heard of people saying\n“earthly desires are enlightenment” as if they should be celebrated. I’m sorry, but this is plain wrong, no\nmatter who said it or which master said it.\n“Tregchö and thögal involve a great deal of intent and involve structured retreats.\nKeep that [Mr. J] nonsense out of this group. Thanks.\n…\nMany people fail to understand that to get to a point of non-striving in Dzogpachenpo, a great deal of effort\nmust occur in order to get to that point.\nThe view of Dzogchen is simple in theory, but difficult in practice due to the presence of habitual tendencies\nwhich obstruct even the beginner’s ability to remain in equipoise.\nThis is why for example, Jean-Luc Achard compares retreat to wetting a cloth. If we only wet a cloth\nsometimes it will dry quickly, no water is retained, however if you wet the cloth a great deal, and often, it\nwill remain wet. The same principle applies to a Dzogchen practitioner, which is why retreat is indispensable\nfor serious practitioners.\nTregchö retreats are meant to “wet the cloth” greatly so that it will not dry once the practitioner leaves\nretreat to engage his or her three doors and sense consciousnesses more actively in daily life.\nPeople who believe Tregchö involves no effort and no striving, and believe they have understood its\nmeaning without extended practice should seek a qualified teacher and learn properly in order to bring\nsome clarity to their understanding.” - Kyle Dixon, 2019, Nonsectarian Dzogchen Atiyoga & Mahamudra\n“We still have to meditate, but this meditation becomes directionless (or more accurately, aimlessness and\nwishlessness -- one of the three doors of liberation) and without subject-object (I'm here, trying to get 'there')\nbut immediate practice-enlightenment or instant actualization in every encounter or activity, sitting, walking,\nworking, encountering people. This effort is not the same as the dualistic effort of trying to attain a result\nin the future, or trying to sustain a subject/object structure by bringing in a dualistic form of watching.\nThere can and should be effort and focus in practice, but this effort and focus is applied in a way that\ncompletely dissolves the subject/object structure rather than retain or strengthen it, for example when\nbeing mindful of the breathing, the breathing is its own attention and awareness, there is no dualistic\nattempt to 'shine the spotlight of awareness on an object or a subject'. Effort and focus, and effortlessness\nbecomes one. This is why Dogen's teachings are very useful here to counteract the nihilism of the wrongful\n1092\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nunderstanding of non-action. The kind of \"doing\" or \"action\" we should be rid of is not \"don't have to make\nany effort\" but \"not being affected by results/gain/loss\", for it is the attachment to the results that are\nkarmic. Each step, each breath, becomes the ends rather than the means -- it is the actualization of\nenlightenment/Buddha-nature rather than a means to get enlightenment in the future.\nAnd this, also happens to be true non-meditation and non-action, beyond the sense of there being a\nmeditator-meditation and actor-action.” - Soh, 2018\n\"People that have gone into the nihilistic understanding of 'non-doing' ended up in a mess. You see that\nthose having right understanding of 'non-doing' are free, yet you see discipline, focus and peace in them.\nLike just sitting and walking... ...in whatever they endeavor.

Its just that it's not possible to\ndivide them\".\nThis being so, know that the undividedness of practice and enlightenment is itself the Buddha ancestors.\nA walk with Dogen into our time xxv\nThe Essential Dogen: Writings of the Great Zen Master\"\n“Practice after anatta, emptiness, spontaneous perfection\n1093\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nI think some discussions came up recently relating to spontaneous perfection and practice, and I have\ncommented similar things before but I will say it again.\nEven after anatta, emptiness, where everything is tasted as nondual luminosity that is empty like reflections,\nall spontaneously perfected without effort and action, it does not contradict the importance of practice but\npractice becomes dynamic actualization or practice-enlightenment. Practices are no longer done in order\nto achieve a future goal because the very act of practicing is the actualization of the spontaneous perfection\nin the here and now (only conventionally speaking - there is no here and now to be found). The act of\nbreathing, that very breath itself, the chanting itself, the whatever practice you do becomes the total\nexertion of spontaneously perfected empty presencing... the practice brings forth the simultaneous\nqualities of shamatha and vipashyana and mind is at peace, still, attentive and sharp and focused not in a\ncontrived way but in a natural state of no mind. Whatever practices that are done, are done for shamatha\nand vipashyana for this is the sole means of liberation, even if the object of meditation or non-meditation\nis simply resting as the nature of mind.\nSpontaneous perfection and non meditation thus is not the same as the nihilistic understanding of non\naction and non meditation as if literally one should not meditate or do any practices whatsoever. That\nbecomes neo advaita teaching and unfortunately it seems that many people (the likes of Mr. J) interpret\ndzogchen and kunjed gyalpo that way turning it into something no different from neo-advaita. Such people\nwill reason that a wild untamed mind is of no harm to some inherently perfect awareness like the clouds\nnever hinder the sky, which in turns reifies a background awareness, negates the influence of karmic\npropensities and importance of practices and view, etc. Their inherently existing awareness is so ultimate\nand absolute that it is never touched, affected, harmed nor improved by karmic traces nor actions and\nefforts (hence they reason, why the need for practices?), but they will never understand that brahman is\nnot more ultimate and cosmic than a single breath or act of sitting, that there is no mirror besides ongoing\nreflections, an empty presencing no where to reside (Residing as an unstained background or all subsuming\nground is just more effort, not true effortlessness). Hence Just sitting, eating, shitting, sleeping becomes\nboth ground and path, and not even a trace of subject and object, meditator and object of meditation arise\nin that moment of actualization. It is not that there is no practice and enlightenment but they are undivided.\nThis is why I find the soto zen emphasis on practice-enlightenment a useful antidote to such nihilistic neo-\nadvaitic view.\nJohn tan also recently wrote, “It is how it is presented. It is important to bring across the point that\nrealization is uncaused or \"not made\". But the methods are effective tools and provide the necessary\nconditions.”\nEven if you are a 10th bhumi or 12th bhumi on the verge of full Buddhahood (which is to say the least, very\nunlikely), practice is important. Heck, even the Buddha himself practices and goes for months long retreats\nregularly focusing on anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) according to his own words and all the\narahants do likewise even though they have “done what is to be done”. The buddha and arahants continue\n1094\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nto benefit from practice and meditation. Their practice is practice-enlightenment, an actualization of true\nnature, not practicing for enlightenment. “\n“Edmond Cigale interesting.

Many wrongly\nconclude that because there is no-self, there is nothing to do and nothing to practice. This is precisely using\n\"self view\" to understand \"anatta\" despite having the insight.\nIt does not mean because there is no-self, there is nothing to practice; rather it is because there is no self,\nthere is only ignorance and the chain of afflicted activities. Practice therefore is about overcoming\nignorance and these chain of afflictive activities. There is no agent but there is attention. Therefore practice\nis about wisdom, vipassana, mindfulness and concentration. If there is no mastery over these practices,\n1098\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nthere is no liberation. So one should not bullshit and psycho ourselves into the wrong path of no-practice\nand waste the invaluable insight of anatta. That said, there is the passive mode of practice of choiceness\nawareness, but one should not misunderstand it as the \"default way\" and such practice can hardly be\nconsidered \"mastery\" of anything, much less liberation.\"\n....\n\"People that have gone into the nihilistic understanding of 'non-doing' ended up in a mess. You see those\nhaving right understanding of 'non-doing' are free, yet you see discipline, focus and peace in them.\nLike just sitting and walking... ...in whatever they endeavor. Fully anatta.\"\n....\nIn my opinion many of our great aspirations and high views turn empty talks easily. After the direct insight\nof anatta, it opens the gate that allows one to experience effortlessly all sensations that arise without duality,\nwithout fear, without doership and without ownership. Many are unable to see the \"Whys\" and \"Hows\" of\n\"directness\" so don't waste your insights that have given the opportunity in this life.

They\nare completely unrelated.\nSession Start: Thursday, 25 February, 2010\n(9:00 PM) Thusness: anyway your answer in newbuddhist forum is no good.\n(9:00 PM) Thusness: you got to have a clearer picture of what is pure subjectivity and you must not be\nconfused with subjective and objective reality. that is, are you skewed towards subjective reality or are\nyou skewed towards objective reality. if beyond these 2 extremes, what is it...and what is the purpose of\nhaving right view of experiential reality? Buddhism is concerned with experiential reality. many only\nunderstand in terms of concepts...the article you posted in buddhism forum by Mr. J expresses it well.\nThat is, he understands it directly. You are still unable to integrate non-dual experience and DO into your\nview.\n(9:13 PM) AEN: oic.. what does Mr. J understand directly.. D.O? i don’t really understand what you mean by\nnot confused with subjective and objective reality\n(9:31 PM) Thusness: you are misunderstanding 'objective reality' with experiential reality. like the 'body' is\njust a mental construct that once seem so real, objective reality too must be treated as a mental construct\nno different from the case of the 'body'\n(9:34 PM) AEN: oic..\n(9:34 PM) Thusness: however when you do that, you might mistaken it as pure subjectivity. therefore you\nmust practice and continue to refine your understanding till you completely purified all these tendencies\nto treat things as truly existing as in first 'mental constructs', then presence.\n(9:37 PM) AEN: 'then presence'?\n(9:37 PM) Thusness: what you have expressed so far cannot show clarity that you have integrate your\nviews into just one whole field of experiential reality.\n(9:38 PM) AEN: like what david carse said 'what all this is is All That Is, pure Being Consciousness Bliss\nOutpouring; it is your perception of it as a physical world that is maya, illusion.' however the article of Mr.\nJ does but the view isn't clear.\n(9:38 PM) AEN: oic. you mean Mr. J talks about dependent origination?\n(9:38 PM) Thusness: nope... but he manage to understand from his realization and direct experience to\nresolve all into One Mind.\n(9:39 PM) AEN: icic.. its like what david loy said rite: That samsara is nirvana is a major tenet of Mahayana\nphilosophy. \"Nothing of samsara is different from nirvana, nothing of nirvana is different from samsara.\n1100\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nThat which is the limit of nirvana is also the limit of samsara; there is not the slightest difference between\nthe two.\" [1] And yet there must be some difference between them, for otherwise no distinction would\nhave been made and there would be no need for two words to describe the same state. So Nagarjuna\nalso distinguishes them: \"That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of being born and\npassing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared to be nirvana.\" [2] There is only\none reality -- this world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Samsara is\nthe \"relative\" world as usually experienced, in which \"I\" dualistically perceive \"it\" as a collection of objects\nwhich interact causally in space and time. Nirvana is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it\nincorporates both subject and object into a whole which, Madhyamika insists, cannot be characterized\n(Chandrakirti: \"Nirvana or Reality is that which is absolved of all thought-construction\"), but which\nYogacara nevertheless sometimes calls \"Mind\" or \"Buddhanature,\" and so forth.\n(9:43 PM) Thusness: one taste in both essence and nature of all arising. but even at that phase, it is not\nOne Reality as in Identical reality. or a truly existing 'One Whole Reality'. this is what a practitioner after\ngoing through One Mind or the Advaita Vedanta experience will conclude\n(9:46 PM) Thusness: what is the truth of this 'One Whole Reality' that a practitioner after maturing non-\ndual experience? Even a practitioner after maturing this state will not be able to sync his view with this\nexperience. because he is using a dualistic expression and not a DO view.\n(9:48 PM) AEN: oic..\n(9:49 PM) Thusness: this is the same as one that experience the pure presence of \"Iness\" and say that this\n\"I\" is the same \"I\" in you as in him and me. in non-dual state, the practitioner will still fall into the same\ntrap -- the one whole reality. Get it?\n(9:52 PM) AEN: hmm.. but what you mean by *but even at that phase, it is not One Reality as in Identical\nreality or a truly existing 'One Whole Reality'\n- you mean at that level there is some understanding of emptiness\n(9:52 PM) Thusness: no. what is the 'One Reality' that David Carse is talking about? is this a Subjective\nReality or an Objective Reality?\n(9:54 PM) AEN: neither\n(9:55 PM) Thusness: an integration where there is no distinction that can be found between the subject-\nobject-ive reality, as an integrated whole?\n(9:56 PM) AEN: yah.. just oneness?\n(9:56 PM) Thusness: is there such a 'Oneness Reality'? When we fall into this trap after non-dual\nexperience, we are falling into the same trap as claiming that the 'I' in you is the same 'I' in me after the\nexperience of \"I AMness\". so neither subjective nor objective nor the integration of both nor the\ninteraction of both. we think in such a way because of our 'inherent view'...that is why I said experience is\nnot enough, you need the right view. so after this phase of One Mind, don't get over excited, refine the\nview (anatta and DO). also understand why this is important to end suffering\n(10:06 PM) AEN: oic.. how is it important to end suffering?\n(10:07 PM) Thusness: why are you asking me?

so don't just talk about self-liberation as if you\nhave reached tat state. you got to know what it meant\n(11:44 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:44 PM) Thusness: when you say that, you are not discussing... so what is liberation when your mind is\ndualistic? how do you understand it?\n(11:44 PM) AEN: by disassociation?\n(11:45 PM) Thusness: through disassociation...yes. you always want to dis-associate. when you are non-\ndual what happen? when anatta what happened? when there is no source behind, what is there to dis-\nassociate? so what is it like? and what is meant by self-liberation in this sense? it does not mean you are\nalready liberated as like what you expressed...\n(11:46 PM) Thusness: sound liberates. what does that mean? it just mean that do not attempt to think\nliberation in terms of dis-association. if you are not dis-associating, then how? it is the way a practitioner\n'understand practice' after maturing his experiential insight of anatta into the natural state. it does not\nmean nothing to do, or it already liberates\nno.... it does not mean that\n(11:50 PM) AEN: oic.. does it mean that without disassociating nor grasping, phenomena itself arise and\nsubside on itself\n(11:53 PM) Thusness: phenomena is also arising and subsiding\n(11:53 PM) Thusness: is always\nso don't talk about that\n(11:53 PM) AEN: icic\n1102\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n(11:53 PM) Thusness: just write what i told you. it is not that there is nothing to do as in the case of the\nadvaita\n(11:54 PM) AEN: oic\n(11:55 PM) Thusness: don't talk as if you already know what self-liberation is. but say when the mind is\ndualistic, how it perceives liberation. and when non-dual, how he perceives it to be? when anatta, what is\nit like if there is no source, how is one to dis-associate? what is liberation like when a person experientially\nand truly realized that? how by resting in a dualistic and inherent view mistake 'dis-association' as the\npath. you posted an article in the past that spoke briefly about it\n(11:58 PM) AEN: at sgforums?\n(11:59 PM) Thusness: yeah...forgot his name...in your blog too\n(12:00 AM) AEN: djhampa?\ni don’t remember posting his post in my blog lhe\n(12:02 AM) Thusness: nope\n(12:03 AM) Thusness: Dr. John Welwood (Soh: Reflection and Presence: The Dialectic of Awakening, a good\nread https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/11/reflection-and-presence-dialectic-of.html )\n(12:03 AM) AEN: ooh icic\n(12:05 AM) Thusness: you must understand what i told you above. what is meant by dualistic and inherent\nview and its power to shape our experience. so you know what is the relationship with the right view?\n(12:08 AM) AEN: and liberation?\n(12:08 AM) Thusness: yes\n(12:09 AM) AEN: yeah.. better understand now.\n(12:13 AM) Thusness: so what is the meaning of 'always and already so'? and what is practice like?\n(12:16 AM) AEN: back sorry.. someone called me, wrong number. always and already so means awareness\nisnt separated and is actually everything arising moment to moment, so practice is just experiencing\neverything without dualistic and inherent view?\n(12:17 AM) Thusness: what has that got to do with self liberation?\n(12:17 AM) AEN: it does not require disassociating, just experiencing everything as it is without dualistic\nand inherent view?\n(12:18 AM) Thusness: are you able to do that?\n(12:18 AM) AEN: no\n(12:18 AM) Thusness: why?\n(12:18 AM) AEN: bcos i still have dualistic and inherent views\n(12:18 AM) Thusness: yes. therefore you must know that because we see with such views, without such\nviews, that is liberation. that is why right view is important. if 'dualistic and inherent' view is dissolved\nfrom the deepest depth of our consciousness, that already is liberation. therefore practice is to meet\nconditions and see whether inherent and dualistic view arise. if it arises, then how could there be no\nsuffering\n(12:21 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:21 AM) Thusness: therefore ignorance is the cause of suffering. it is the wrong view that shapes the\nexperience. that experience with the wrong view is what that causes psychological and spiritual pain\n1103\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n(12:22 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:22 AM) Thusness: any moment you have that experience it is always so. so practice is dynamic to see\nsuch tendencies arise\n(12:23 AM) AEN: icic..\n(12:24 AM) Thusness: because a practitioner mature his non-dual and anatta experience, his practice is\ndynamic as he realizes that all arising already so and always is so -- luminous and empty but we mistaken\nit as dualistic and inherent. it is the deeply rooted wrong view that shape and distort experience that\ncauses all problems. get it?\n(12:25 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:25 AM) Thusness: it is not negative feelings is already liberated...all sort of nonsense. did i teach you\nthat\nlike what Mr. J said? ignorance of seeing separation and inherent existence causes all these problems, and\nnegative feelings arise because of that. so at that moment when you see that it is non-dual and empty, it\nliberates. if you do not experience that at the moment, how can you be liberated. when you try to get rid\nof the anger, you can't...either you are split or there is something inherent in you. so when you see the\n'nature and essence' of any arising be it negative emotions or whatever as empty and luminous, it\nliberates. You see it with your entire body/mind/soul therefore it liberates. if you din see it, no. get it?\n(12:34 AM) Thusness: you must see the nature and essence of all arising as so.\n(12:37 AM) AEN: oic..\n(12:39 AM) Thusness: therefore when Mr. J said, negative emotion is liberation, he is having inherent view.\ncoz he sees awareness as the substance, and think that since it is it, it is liberation and yet feeling pain. so\nthat is confusion due to desync of view and experience with no clarity of insight. not knowing what causes\nthe pain\n(12:40 AM) Thusness: so understand ignorance. understand how inherent and dualistic view causes the\nproblem\n(12:43 AM) AEN: icic.. you mean there is no pain when one experience self liberation?\n(12:44 AM) Thusness: of course there is pain if there is pain. it is the all of what the sensations are\n(12:44 AM) AEN: what you mean\n(12:45 AM) Thusness: you mean when you taste sour you don't know that it is sour?\n(12:45 AM) AEN: i know\n(12:45 AM) Thusness: then when there is those sensations that arise due to the conditions, you deny\nthose sensations? whatever that you have dissolved, it isn't there. whatever conditions that contribute to\nthe arising, has to arise\n(12:47 AM) AEN: oic.. but you said negative emotion is liberation is wrong view?\n(12:50 AM) Thusness: only when you resolve that this pristine awareness is luminous yet empty, that is\nliberation\n(12:50 AM) Thusness: not seeing pristine awareness as inherent and dual\n1104\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nExcerpts from Original Enlightenment and Original Nature is a wrong view / How did Ignorance originate\netc\n2009:\n(7:34 PM) AEN: icic.. http://www.zenforuminternational.org/viewtopic.php?f=8...\n(7:37 PM) AEN: namdrol says there cant be original enlightenment as that wld be the hindu teaching\nor atman (Namdrol = acarya malcolm smith)\n(7:38 PM) Thusness: yes because they see non-dual as enlightenment\n(7:38 PM) AEN: oic\n(7:39 PM) Thusness: you mean e-sangha ban them? lol\n(7:40 PM) AEN: yeah... alot of zen teachers and even moderators were banned during a period of time and\ne-sangha even received lawsuits thread etc\n(7:40 PM) Thusness: by the way, that is also not hindu teachings\n(7:40 PM) AEN: and members\nthere were also other issues i think... some don’t believe in rebirth etc... and some other things\n(7:40 PM) AEN: im not exactly sure what happened\n(7:40 PM) Thusness: that is neo-advaita teaching\n(7:40 PM) AEN: oic\n(7:41 PM) Thusness: because we are already enlightened so why practice?\n(7:41 PM) Thusness: yet this will arise another insight\nso this is also necessary\n(7:42 PM) Thusness: first of all if this is not true, how is it that so many practitioners are claiming that?\n(7:42 PM) AEN: they have the view of an inherent consciousness?\n(7:43 PM) Thusness: there must be certain experience or incomplete realization that led practitioners to\nsuch a conclusion. it too is a koan. if one stops at One Mind, it will most likely end up concluding that way.\nyet it is also important that you come to the same conclusion.\njust like I AMness\n(7:49 PM) AEN: icic.. the original enlightenment is realised at non dual ?\n(7:49 PM) Thusness: yes\n(7:50 PM) AEN: icic\n(7:50 PM) Thusness: i think i told you we do not have a perfect nature right? we have a dependent\noriginated nature\n(7:50 PM) AEN: oic.. but at the same time its spontaneously perfected?\n(7:51 PM) Thusness: however it is also important that you arrive at the same conclusion as those zen\npractitioners\n(7:51 PM) AEN: oic\n(7:52 PM) Thusness: that is different. i have already told you many times not to talk about spontaneous\narising, liberation or perfection\n(7:52 PM) AEN: icic..\n1105\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n(7:53 PM) Thusness: only after the direct insight of anatta and DO can you talk about that. this I have\nemphasized many times to you and written many times\n(7:54 PM) AEN: oic..\n(7:55 PM) Thusness: this is because after the insight of anatta and DO, you are already purified and clear\nof the wrong understanding. ignorance is the cause of suffering, when it dissolves, you are naturally and\nspontaneously perfected\n(7:58 PM) AEN: icic.. but even when there is ignorance, our nature is spontaneously perfected right, just\nnot realised?\n(7:59 PM) Thusness: nope..\n(7:59 PM) AEN: oic what you mean\n(7:59 PM) Thusness: to me yes, to you no. for i know what it meant\n...\nLikewise that view is rejected in the text that Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith was explaining:\nThe Basis as Naturally Perfect 2.1.1.1.1 Nevertheless, first, the assertion of the basis as naturally perfect is\nconfirmed by understanding the four wheels: [Thesis] Naturally perfect reality is unfragmented and\nwhole. [Refutation] The refutation states that this assertion that the basis is naturally perfect is defective.\nIf it is claimed that at the time of the cause [the basis] is naturally perfect, the result also will be naturally\nperfect, [15b] like the example of butter already being naturally perfect in milk. In the same way, is the\ncause established\nor not established in the result? If it is established, the result becomes a cause. Since a result is then\npointless, the cause (deluded sentient beings) would then turn into the result (buddhas). In that case,\nthere would be no need for anyone to make effort. If the cause is not established in the result, the\nassertion of the natural perfection [of the basis] is defective. Further, if it is said, “[The basis] is\nestablished at the time of the cause, but it is not established at the time of the result,” then natural\nperfection would alternate and become a view that falls into the extremes of existence and nonexistence.\nIf it is said, “Because [the basis] is naturally perfect, it isn’t anything at all,” then this is no different than\nthe Cittamātra assertion that the dependent nature is ultimate. The Six Dimensions Tantra states: Since\nthe cause and result are different, [the basis] too is not naturally\nperfect. Likewise, if the cause and result were the same, effort would be meaningless. The two replies to\nthe objection can be inferred. Here they will not be mentioned. Since the essence is pure from the\nbeginning, saṃsāra is not established. [16a] Since the nature arises as a diversity, nirvāṇa is not\nestablished. Since the essence and nature are nondual, they are present as an intrinsic nature 64 that has\nnever experienced delusion.\n- Buddhahood in This Life, Dzogchen book/text by Vimalamitra translated by Acarya Malcolm Smith\n.....\n1106\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nAnother interesting post I saw by Arcaya Malcolm recently:\n\"Another interesting thing they do is try to show is that Dogen had a change of heart and rejected hongaku\nand BNI late in his life.\nNoriaki cites this example, from the Shōbōgenzō shizen bhikkhu, as presented in Pruning the Bodhi Tree,\npg. 123:\nSome people say that, because the enlightenment of the Buddhas and Tathagatas encompass the whole world,\neven a speck of dust manifests that enlightenment. Because that enlightenment encompasses both subject and\nthe object, mountains, rivers, earth, sun, moon, stars, and the four illusions and three poisons express it as well.\nTo see mountains and rivers is to see the Tathagathas, and the four illusions and three poisons are the Buddha-\ndharma. To see a speck of dust is to see the dharma-dhatu and each spontaneous act is a manifestation of\nsupreme enlightenment.

That has no\nbeginning nor end. To visualize a purest state from start is a dualistic view. But it is not appropriate for\nyou to answer this question yet. For it contradicts with many claims of those masters that focus on\nluminosity and have not understood their empty nature.\n(11:26 PM) AEN: icic.. the poster follows korean zen, i tink zen master seung sahn etc\n(11:29 PM) Thusness: Getting 'lost' and becoming dualistic is natural when we develop those\nconditions that make us 'lost'. Being attached to our luminosity is one of the factor. The assumption that\nthere is a purest state and we will not become dualistic is itself a dualistic view.\n(11:32 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:32 PM) Thusness: Luminous yet empty, this is our nature.

When DO replaces the dualistic\nframework, we will understand naturally. Because your views is still very much inherent/dualistic, you find\nit hard to understand. Therefore whatever said is quickly distorted. let DO re-orientate you and practice\n'dropping'\n(11:54 PM) AEN: icic.. ok\n(11:56 PM) Thusness: It takes many many years to re-orientate urself and you have to undergo\nthose phases I told you.\n(11:56 PM) AEN: oic.. which phases\n(11:57 PM) Thusness: the six stages. In which 5 and 6 are most important. 5 is the great stability.\nYou become non conceptual and experience directly. Now you must practice 'dropping' and go non-\nconceptual. But non-conceptuality should not be the object of practice, it must be natural. It comes\nnaturally after the arising of anatta insight. And after that, give up all thoughts can (and?) continue to\n'drop' till anatta is most clear and vivid. Till you become fully non-dual and non-conceptual. You must\npractice dropping, it is safer.\n(12:04 AM) AEN: wat do you mean by it is safer\n(12:05 AM) Thusness: If you don't want to experience side effects, then learn 'dropping'\n(12:05 AM) AEN: icic.. what kind of side effects\n(12:06 AM) Thusness: Give up and let go\n(12:06 AM) AEN: oic.. when i meditate i can let go completely, and enter into an almost thoughtless\nstate... but daily life v hard rite?\n(12:06 AM) Thusness: Till you are open to all sensations naturally, vividly and effortlessly\n(12:07 AM) Thusness: Difficult to tell you now lah\n(12:08 AM) Thusness: You must summarize and be conceptually equipped with the right views first.\nBut these views are provisional. but because we are so caught up in looking for meanings, we want to\nexpand these views more then necessary. Then it becomes dangerous. It must go hand in hand with real\nexperience. It can take few decades of practice b4 true insight dawns\n1108\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\n(12:13 AM) AEN: oic... true insight as in prajna wisdom?\n(12:19 AM) Thusness: Yes\n~ Questions about Spontaneous Perfection\nSomeone asked: \"Like someone asked in another post about crazy wisdom, can't a guru perform some\nunskillful action and call it not his doing, it's just happening and asking his disciple to surrender/accept to\nwhat is. That it is spontaneously perfect and that is is just seeing/hearing?\"\nSoh replied: “Actually surrendering is unrelated to spontaneous perfection. Surrendering requires the\nsense of a self, and a higher power, and is the path that leads to impersonality -- one of the four aspects of\nI AM. If one is still practicing surrendering, one has not even realized anatta yet, but it is a path of practice\nin the earlier stages of practice. In anatta there is in seeing just colors, in hearing just sounds, there is no\nhearer or seer, no self/Self at all and nothing to surrender to.\nSpontaneous perfection just means everything is fundamentally in quiescence nirvana, non-arising, and\nluminous by nature, already anatta and empty, and effortlessly so. This must be realized and actualized\notherwise it is just a bunch of fanciful intellectual words, completely useless and detrimental in fact.\nSpontaneous perfection has absolutely nothing to do with labelling something as 'perfect', which is just\nanother delusion because now you are imputing some inherently existing characteristic of 'perfection' to\nsome truly existing 'self' or 'phenomena' or worse, some imagined ontological and metaphysical 'perfect\nnature' (and you will impute that until you get to stage 5, as stage 1 to 4 all have varying delusions of an\ninherently existing perfect nature), and all notions of inherently existing characteristics are delusions. So\nbefore stable 5 and 6, any notion of 'spontaneous perfection' is just going to add fuel to the fire of delusions.\nThis is why you cannot skip Stages 1 to 7. You cannot, for example, go straight to Stage 7. Nobody can do\nthat, except for a few people that are in the realm of myths and legends. So Stage 7 is basically useless for\na beginner unless they have already very deep insights into 5 and 6 and then they can breakthrough to 7,\notherwise it is going to be very harmful to emphasize on that point as it will certainly be misunderstood, so\nit's basically meaningless. Spontaneous perfection means the nature of anatta and emptiness, as realized\nin Stage 5 and 6, are spontaneously perfected in all manifestations, as the nature of all manifestations or\ndisplay are already anatta, empty and non-arisen from the beginning. So if 5 and 6 are not realized, well\nthen, what the hell are you even talking about?\nHence, emphasis should rather be placed on giving rise to the correct insights, and then spontaneous\nperfection will come on its own when the conditions are right.\nWhen actualized, there will not be unskillful actions driven by afflictions, as afflictions are liberated. This is\nwhy I am not into crazy wisdom (I am very cynical of any gurus of any traditions that act in ways that are\ninterpreted as ‘crazy wisdom’, to me ‘craziness’ is just a sign of immaturity and ignorance and should not\nbe given excuses. And why do we need to put gurus on a pedestal in the first place??? Why do people want\n1109\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nto be blind sheep of some figure? All the abuse and corruption going on just makes me lose confidence in\ninstitutionalised religions and partly explains my distaste for the whole guru system and my anti-\nauthoritarian inclinations. End of rant), as wisdom liberates afflictions and actions driven by afflictions. And\nanyone who still acts in an abusive and harmful manner to other fellow human beings are simply acting\nout of personal immaturity, and immaturity of their own insights and practice, regardless of whatever\ninsights they’ve had.”\nSoh, 2019: “I am not a fan of guru devotion. I personally think it is unnecessary and causes all kinds of abuse\nlike what we saw in andrew cohen and mooji. Even papaji is not without his own scandal.\nTo me, the job of the guru is to point, that is all. When the student realises their own nature it is their own\ndirect seeing, not an act of faith or devotion. I do not advocate for any sort of blind devotion whatsoever,\nin fact I am quite against it. I am anti authoritarian. My attitude on this matter is probably closer to the two\nkrishnamurties than certain forms of traditional buddhism.\nAnd even the job of the guru is not restricted to gurus these days\nhttps://greg-goode.com/article/from-the-age-of-the-guru-to-the-age-of-the-friend/\nif someone can point out I AM then just call it what it is - someone who can point out I AM.\nThere is no need to worship such a person.

Another example is Adi da samraj, who taught complete surrender to guru as\nthe method to attain his realization (which by the way, is only at the level of one mind, not anatta or\nemptiness).

Eisai's reply to Dogen's question was: \"No Buddha is conscious of its existence [that is, of this\nEssential-nature], while cats and oxen [that is the grossly deluded] are aware of it.\" In other words, Buddhas,\nprecisely because they are Buddhas, no longer think of having or not having a Perfect-nature; only the\ndeluded think in such terms. At these words Dogen had an inner realization which dissolved his deep-\nseated doubt.\"-- Yasutani-roshi's Introductory Lectures on Zen Training\nAlso see: Original Enlightenment and Original Nature is a wrong view / How did Ignorance originate etc\nThere is a conversation with John Tan and Soh where John refuted notions of a perfect nature in 2007 and\n2009: No Buddha is Conscious of its Existence [of having a Perfect-nature]\n“Spontaneous arising cannot be taught first. You cannot tell people things just happen by itself. You cannot\ntell people to practise this way. Only after certain stage, when a person has seen non-duality, experienced\nthe luminosity, experienced the passing and dissolving away, you can tell them. Because it is leading\ntowards that already. But before that, if you tell them, they are being controlled by the momentum, merely\nswapped away only. It is very dangerous to tell people to just relax. Why does a person say that? Because\nthey failed to see the strength of what I call, pre-consciousness, the strength of propensities. You see what\nI mean? When you tell or teach a person “just relax lah, just let everything manifest.” You can’t. A person\nthat does this probably turns to being ultimate slacker. Didn’t do anything. {laugh}\nRather than practising, he is digging his own grave you know, enhancing the momentum. Why spontaneous\narising is for a person that is understood (reality)... especially that he has gone through non-duality. He can\n“do” spontaneous arising. He can practise spontaneous arising. Why is this so? Because once a person\nenters into non-duality, the bond of the Self is already gone. A big chunk of the bond, the Self-propensities\nare already gone. And when this self propensities is gone, the energy turning against itself is being released,\nand work for itself. It does not die, you know. It is just released and then works for itself, rather than turning\nagainst itself. So only a person that has understood and experienced non-duality, it is better for him to\npenetrate spontaneous arising, to practice this way. Because can see.. {inaudible} there is no need to\nrespond anything. Do you get what I mean? But if let’s say you do not see it, like I said that everything is the\nMind, but you did not see that everything is the Mind then you start to say “don’t need to do anything”, you\n1114\nSTAGE 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected\nare letting your momentum take [over]…” - John Tan, 2007, Transcript of Lankavatara Sutra with Thusness\n2007\nIt is very common and easy for someone without the realizations to mimic the expressions of naturalness\nand spontaneity, but such mimicry is never the real thing but a fabricated version that is ironically not\n‘natural’. It’s absolutely useless to “try” to “be spontaneous” and mimic the zen expressions of\nspontaneity and naturalness without giving rise to the proper experiential insights, kensho, and\nsatori. It is important to understand that mimicry will not get you there, just like trying to mimic or train a\nstate of being emotionless is not the same as overcoming the emotional afflictions (see next chapter), for\nthe insights and actualization and causal conditions for such a liberation are not addressed. This is why we\nhave to focus on emphasizing on the causes - the insights and wisdom that leads to “naturalness”,\n“spontaneous perfection”, “freedom from emotional afflictions” rather than mimic the states and deceive\nourselves, thinking we are getting there where in fact we are simply training a pretense-state, a contrived\nstate.\n“as to buddhadharma, no effort is necessary. You have only to be ordinary, with nothing to do—\ndefecating, urinating, wearing clothes, eating food, and lying down when tired.”\n(Record of Linji, tr Sasaki, p 11-12)\n'I neither desire heavenly realms,\nNor want blessings in this world.\nWhen hungry, eat;\nTired, sleep.\nFools laugh at me,\nBut the wise know its wisdom.\nIt’s not being stupid –\nIt’s what we originally are.'\n(Enjoying the Way by Nanyue Mingzan, aka Lazy Zan)\n'You get up in the morning, dress, wash your face, and so on; you call these miscellaneous thoughts, but\nall that is necessary is that there be no perceiver or perceived when you perceive—no hearer or heard\nwhen you hear, no thinker or thought when you think. Buddhism is very easy and very economical; it\nspares effort, but you yourself waste energy and make your own hardships.'\n(Foyan Qingyuan, in Instant Zen, p 70)\n“Yes Zen is about ordinary experience, yet you must understand what is meant by ordinary mind. :) The\nordinary mind is the mind of anatta. If we pretend to be ordinary and try to 'look' for expression of\nordinariness then we are deluded. If we fail to realize that true ordinariness comes from the realization of\nanatta and mistaken the finger for the moon, we are deluded. Without the insight of anatta, how could we\never understand the essence of being natural, effortless and ordinary? This is what Buddhism meant by\nordinary.\nYet I have seen people going after 'ordinariness', trying to be 'nothing special', attempting to look for\nexpression of ordinariness. That is why for (Soh: I believe he meant certain misguided/deluded) zen\n1115\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\npractitioners, they will not understand the seven phases of experience. They are caught up by 'forms', by\nthe stages of the ox herding and missed the insight. :)\nUnless practitioners realize clearly how these insights lead to the ordinary and natural state, there is no\nmeaning in looking for 'sweep floor and washing dishes' or 'chop wood carry water'. This is the next disease\nof Zen. These practitioners are actively looking for such expressions. They do not have the wisdom to\ndiscern. What you have to awaken is the insights into our empty yet luminous nature, then talk about\nordinariness and the natural state. That is why I told you, don't talk about natural state or spontaneous\narising. However people just like to talk about that. Once you realized anatta, ordinariness and the natural\nstate mean something very different. You can breathe hard, you can breathe soft, yet both are considered\nnatural and ordinary. You can take a deep breath or short breath, still as non-dual, natural and ordinary.\nSincere practitioners can take many years to come to this natural state even after the initial glimpse of\ninsight of anatta.” - John Tan, 2009\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\nThusness, 2005~2007:\nCk: John, how to practise vipassana in daily life?\nThusness: Just observe every sensation, until one day you are able to experience \"emptiness as form\".\nThen it becomes effortless. Truthz you cannot imagine the bliss when one clearly experiences that. But\nthere is no point to over stress anything.\nCk: Thusness, just observe every sensation... give me an example?\nThusness: When you breath, you don't have to care about what is the right way of breathing, whether\nyou breath hard or soft, smooth or fine...just experience as much clarity as you can...just that\nexperience...regardless of what it is like. Same for all other experiences.\nCk: What about sound? How is it?\nThusness: When you hear, just the sound...the totality of the sound. There is no how but just to do away\nwith all arbitrary thoughts. Hear the sound as clear as you can.\nCk: Then what about thoughts? Thoughts are very sticky.\nThusness: Thoughts seldom arise if the practice is correct. If it arises, then not to chase after its meaning.\nNot to answer yourself what it means, not to dwell on 'what'...then you will resort to just the moment of\nawareness.\nCk: When I try to be just openly aware, I notice that I jump from sense to sense. Like one moment\nhearing, then touch, etc.\nThusness: That is ok. Our nature is so.\n1116\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\nCk: What’s the right way to do it?\nThusness: Don't think that you should concentrate. Your only duty is to sense with as much clarity as\npossible.\nCk: And for all the sensations, I don’t dwell in the 'what'?\nThusness: Your mind is looking for a way, a method. But what that is needed is only the clarity. However\nbecause our mind is so molded and affected by our habitual propensities, it becomes difficult what that is\ndirect and simple. Just stop asking 'how', 'what', 'why'. And submerge into the moment. And experience. I\nprefer you to describe. Not to ask how, what, why, when, where and who. Only this is necessary.\nCk: Ok.\nThusness: If you practise immediately, you will understand. If you entertain who, what, where, when and\nhow, you create more propensities and dull your own luminosity.\nCk: By the way, I shuffle self-inquiry, observing sensations and thoughts, being aware... It’s ok, right?\nThusness: Yes.\nCk: Means start work i'll have even more propensities...\nThusness: That is when you do not understand what awareness is, but it is true to a certain extent.\n.....\n(10:07 PM) Thusness: tell me what you think is awareness? in your own words\n(10:07 PM) Thusness: just say\n(10:08 PM) AEN: just the knowingness, the sensation or thoughts etc\n(10:09 PM) Thusness: look at the skin of your hands\n(10:09 PM) AEN: ok\n(10:09 PM) Thusness: looks real?\n(10:09 PM) AEN: yea\n(10:09 PM) Thusness: touch it… feel it as much as you can\n(10:10 PM) Thusness: can you don't think of a background\n(10:10 PM) AEN: yea\n(10:10 PM) Thusness: and know that, that is awareness?\n(10:10 PM) AEN: ya\n(10:10 PM) Thusness: that is all.\n.....\n[22:37] <^john^> so far what do you understand about awareness?\n[22:38] hmm like you say lor... awareness is never lost\n1117\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\n[22:39] <^john^> what is awareness right now? when you say thought arises, is thought awareness?\n[22:41] Soh: thought is not awareness, but there is awareness of thought\n[22:41] <^john^> so what is thought? and where is awareness? same like taste, is the taste awareness?\n[22:45] Soh: i think you cant define awareness to a 'thing' Razz\n[22:45] <^john^> so is taste or thought a thing? :) you practice meditation now right? :)\n[22:47] Soh: never practise for quite some time. taste or thought is not a thing\n[22:49] <^john^> so do you think awareness is a party behind thinking thought or experiencing taste? :)\nlol\n[22:49] Soh: no\n[22:49] <^john^> taste is not a thing, then what is it?\n[22:50] Soh: just the awareness\n[22:50] <^john^> experience this awareness with totality. :)\n.....\n(12:21 AM) Thusness: what is the role of insight meditation? why bare attention? why naked awareness?\nwhen insight meditation is taught and buddha said when hearing jsut the sound...this and that… what\nbuddha wanted is to experience directly what awareness is, the arising, the ceasing, the clarity, the non-\ndual nature. in DO\n(12:24 AM) AEN_____: icic..\n(12:24 AM) Thusness: not to note it with thought or place any conclusion on any experience. \"this is\nimpermanence\" is not about noting and place any conclusion about an phenomenon arising. but\nexperience impermanence directly, not in words\n(12:26 AM) AEN_____: icic.. yea\n(12:26 AM) Thusness: be impermanence and know what is it really… see what clarity is, not what it should\nbe. it is luminous and yet empty...experience it directly...it is so.\n(12:27 AM) AEN_____: icic..\n(12:27 AM) Thusness: break the solidity until there is no holding simply thus. don't watch...there is no\nwatcher...there is just momentary manifestation and that is already luminosity and emptiness\n(12:31 AM) AEN: but in conventional saying we say often say watching\n(12:31 AM) AEN: easier to understand\n(12:31 AM) Thusness: yeah but i am not talking about conventional or ultimate. if it is just a form of\nexpression there is nothing wrong with it. but the fact is we are really experiencing it as if there is a\nwatcher...that is the problem.\n.....\n2007:\n1118\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\n(10:03 PM) Thusness: lately i have been experiencing more vividly \"Emptiness as form\". insight\nmeditation (vipassana) like what buddha taught is very important. when seeing, just the seen. when\nhearing, just the heard\n(10:04 PM) AEN: oic isn't this non duality\n(10:04 PM) Thusness: yeah… but the depth of clarity. it is difficult for me to tell you. just train\nyourself into that.. if you didn’t, your life will be wasted. even with all the things i tell you. :) after non\nduality, you must experience until at least this level, \"Emptiness as form\"\n(10:06 PM) AEN: btw emptiness as form is not form as emptiness? it's like the dharma dan\nheart sutra model\n(10:06 PM) AEN: first is form as form, then emptiness is emptiness, then form is emptiness,\nthen emptiness is form ?\n(10:06 PM) Thusness: just the manifestation until tremendous clarity.\n(10:06 PM) Thusness: no need… just non-dual and the depth of non-duality\n\"14/06/2006\nReply part 1:\nIs Absorption not aware of other things? This is difficult to say. Although many articles and books about\nmindfulness seem to suggest that it is so, this is not necessarily true when we progress towards the more\nsubtle experience. Clarity can come a time where it is so clear that it is an absorption, it is a sort of\nInsight-Absorption but It is different from absorption derived from concentration. It is clarity absorption\nwhere it touches the heart of 'things', that is itself. For example being taste itself, it is absorbed yet\ncompletely clear. This is truly blissful and beyond description. I have not come across any book touching\nthis yet and I hope Toni's new book can write something about it. :)\nReply part 2:\nThe AMness can be said to be a form of absorption where the object of concentration is the Self. It can be\na question \"Who am I\" that leads one to the experience of the subject-object becoming one. Till a point\nthe practitioner simply experiences a pure sense of existence. However such mode of experience has no\nunderstanding of its luminous clarity and its nature as anatta. The key point about mindful awareness is\nthere is no keeping of the mind on anything and by not resting on anything, it fuses into everything;\ntherefore it cannot be concentrated; rather it is to relax into nothingness empty of self, empty of any\nartificial doing so that the natural luminosity can take its own course. There is no focusing, there is only\nallowing the mirror bright clarity to shine with it natural radiance. In essence there is no one there, only\nthe phenomenon arising and ceasing telling their stories.\" - John Tan, 2006\n…\n1119\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\n2007:\n(10:50 PM) Thusness:\nat the more refine level of non dual experience, when the sense of self is gone to a great level, there is\nabsolutely nothing but only everything...what does that mean? many though said so but is still not there\neven he is already at the level of non dual.\n(10:51 PM) AEN:\nnot where?\n(10:51 PM) Thusness:\nhe must feel completely nothing and only the 'concreteness', 'solidness', realness... must feel the\n'solidness' and that is things.... that is awareness\n(10:51 PM) AEN:\nOic. Thusness says:\nmany though said so but is still not there even he is already at the level of non dual. --> huh not where?\n(10:52 PM) Thusness:\nthere are different level of non-dual experience. feeling crystal clarity and 'no one there' is the same as\nonly the solidness, hardness, sound, vividness, realness. that 'sense of self' must be completely gone. :)\nyou must remember this.\n(10:55 PM) AEN:\noic.. this is like mindfulness rite\n(10:56 PM) Thusness:\nso now you know why buddha teach mindfulness? and why advaita din. :) this is important. it is the direct\nway. you c, the teaching and the practice is in line.\n(10:57 PM) AEN:\noic..\n(10:57 PM) Thusness:\nso non-dual as in no-self. into impermanence and just the manifestation and DO and authenticate this\nwith insight meditation. however it is taught wrongly. :P\n(10:58 PM) AEN:\nicic\n(10:58 PM) Thusness:\nbut when one experience deeper and understand better, why buddha taught and said those things will\nbecome clear. you will realise that advaita always tok about the Self. but when a person tat is enlightened,\nhe doesn't like to use this word. Self is a by-product. it is the production of thought.\n(11:00 PM) Thusness:\neven if you call it Brahman, it is still sinking back to a source. but when one gets clearer and clearer, and\nknow more about manifestation. there is only arising and ceasing of phenomenon according to\nconditions. that is dharmakaya. it is understood in crystal clarity.\n(11:02 PM) Thusness:\njust understand that there is no self until it sinks to the inmost consciousness. and know the different\nlayers of consciousness but do not think that it is different type of consciousness\nSession Start: Monday, April 13, 2009\n1120\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\n(8:54 PM) AEN: s4bnw: Let's do some inference. The direct path provides a direct way of realising\nour buddha nature, which is in effect, directly helping one to progress faster, spiritually-wise compared to\nthose who take the gradual path, which means they take more time and more round-about way to see\nbuddha nature, isn't it?\n(9:44 PM) Thusness: yes\n(9:45 PM) Thusness: in general yes. it also depends on a practitioner dedication. Buddha said b4 if one\ncan be fully vipassanic for 7 days, one can reach full enlightenment right? if a person can have that sort of\ncrystal clarity like \"I AMness\" in all arising sensations for day and night 7 days, I believe he will reach\nenlightenment\n(9:48 PM) AEN: oic..\n(9:50 PM) Thusness: like I hear sound, till it becomes \"I AMness\", crystal clarity...till it burns away all\nlabels, all divisions, just crystal clear SOUND. If all whatever arises can have that sort of clarity,\npristineness, then I can't imagine...if the concentration is that great. :)\n(9:51 PM) Thusness: actually it is crystal clarity and effortlessness. to me it can only be done when a\npractitioner already penetrate the deepest nature of non dual awareness. That is why he knows why and\nhow deep within him.\n(9:52 PM) Thusness: it is this non-dual clarity\n(9:52 PM) AEN: icic..\n(9:55 PM) AEN: btw then gradual path is what\nYou mean what you said is direct path?\n(9:55 PM) Thusness: gradual\nthen it is the same. like do vipassana till one is able to do that.\n(9:55 PM) AEN: oic..\n(9:56 PM) Thusness: realisation is only one knows the how and why... but that is already quite a deep\nrealisation\n(9:56 PM) Thusness: after stabilizing non-dual then one knows why\nwhy buddha taught vipassana. that crystal clear mirror presence yet empty.\n(9:58 PM) AEN: icic..\n(10:00 PM) Thusness: actually if we can have the fullest and effortless experience of this non-dual\nmirror presence, then nothing matters. whether DO or Brahman, it is the same.\n(10:01 PM) AEN: wat do you mean\n(10:02 PM) Thusness: means at the greatest clarity and completely effortless experience of our\nnon-dual mirror presence, there is no difference. at that point, there are no concepts, labelling, self,\nviews... it is just complete oneness and reality. so no difference\n(10:03 PM) AEN: but non dual is not yet emptiness insight rite\n(10:03 PM) Thusness: emptiness or DO are also raft... if one can completely dissolve the last trace\nwithout any views, then there is no difference. just simply naked awareness, that is sufficient. however we\ndon't know what is naked awareness. we have only a very very vague idea of what non-dual awareness is.\n1121\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\nFor those that experience Eternal Witness, they thought they know...but in truth, only a glimpse...\ntherefore one undergo non-dual, anatta, emptiness and then spontaneous perfection. if we can fully\nexperience non-dual mirror like Awareness in full effortlessness, then we have to be empty, centerless\nand traceless. otherwise there is no true effortlessness and spontaneity. most likely it will be a contrived\nexperience\n(10:07 PM) AEN: u mean through concentration?\n(10:08 PM) Thusness: without understanding of DO and emptiness. because our existing dualistic\nand inherent views is the cause of that contrivance\n(10:10 PM) AEN: oic..\n(10:17 PM) Thusness: what s4bnw said is quite true. don't argue for nothing. direct path is not for\neveryone and you have not face the problem yet.\n.........\n“It is extremely difficult to express what is ‘Isness’. Isness is awareness as forms. It is a pure sense of\npresence yet encompassing the ‘transparent concreteness’ of forms. There is a crystal clear sensations of\nawareness manifesting as the manifold of phenomenal existence. If we are vague in the experiencing of\nthis ‘transparent concreteness’ of Isness, it is always due to that ‘sense of self’ creating the sense of\ndivision… ...you must stress the ‘form’ part of awareness. It is the ‘forms’, it is the ‘things’.” - John Tan, 2007\n....\nSomeone asked, \"A quick question about Thusness Vipassanaa.\nIt's about clarity right?\nLike when I focus on sound, I can see that mind sort of created a visual to describe sound and \"color\" it,\nbut even without the mind there is clear knowing. The sound without mind's coloring is borderless.\"\nSoh replied:\nYou must experience the intensity of luminosity:\n“Good insight. Stability of experience has a predictable relationship with the unfolding and deepening of\ninsights. For example how seamless and effortless can non-dual experience be, if in the back of one's\nmind, subtle views of duality and inherency and tendencies continue to surface and affect our moment to\nmoment experience - for example conjuring an unchanging source or mind that results in a perpetual\ntendency to sink back and referencing experience back to a source.\n1122\nVipassana, John Tan’s Style\nFor example even after it is seen that everything is a manifestation of awareness or mind, there might still\nbe subtle tendencies to reference back to a source, awareness or mind and therefore the transience is\nnot appreciated in full. Nondual is experienced but one sinks back into substantial nonduality - there is\nalways a referencing back to a base, an \"awareness\" that is nevertheless inseparable from all\nphenomena.\nIf one arises the insight that our ideas of an unchanging source, awareness or mind is just another\nthought - that there is simply thought after thought, sight after sight, sound after sound, and there isn't\nan inherent or unchanging \"awareness\", \"mind\", \"source\". Non-dual becomes implicit and effortless when\nthere is the realisation that what awareness, seeing, hearing really is, is just the seen... The heard... The\ntransience... The transience itself rolls and knows, no knower or other \"awareness\" can be found. Like\nthere is no river apart from flowing, no wind apart from blowing, each noun implies its verb... Similarly\nawareness is simply the process of knowing not separated from the known. Scenery sees, music hears.\nBecause there is nothing unchanging, independent, ultimate apart from the transience, there is no more\nsinking back to a source and instead there is full comfort resting as the transience itself.\nLastly do continue practicing the intensity of luminosity... When looking at tennis ball just sense the tennis\nball fully.... Without thinking of a source, background, observer, self. Just the tennis ball as a luminous\nlight. When breathing... Just the breathe... When seeing scenery, just sights, shapes and colours - intensely\nluminous and vivid without an agent or observer. When hearing music... Sound of bird chirping, the\ncrickets… Just that - chirp chirp. A zen master noted upon his awakening... When I am hearing the bell\nringing, there is no I and no bell... Just the ringing. The direct experiencing of no-mind and intensity of\nluminosity.. This is the purpose of the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness that is taught by\nthe Buddha.” - Soh, 2011\nAnd you must give rise to insight of anatta: Vipassana Must Go With Luminous Manifestation\nTherefore contemplating on the two stanzas of anatta (see: On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and\nOrdinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection ) and bahiya sutta (see: The Buddha on Non-Duality ) is\nimportant as part of vipassana contemplation to guide the mind to penetrate view of self/Self and realise\nanatta”\nHere’s a very good video on Vipassana by the dharma teacher Daniel M. Ingram that John Tan and I likes:\nhttps://vimeo.com/250616410\nIt should be understood that as John Tan pointed out, Vipassana needs to go hand in hand with\nluminous manifestation otherwise it becomes merely a mindful reminder but Vipassana is about\ndirect insight: Vipassana Must Go With Luminous Manifestation\n1123\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nAnapanasati is a wonderful practice taught by Buddha which I (Soh) practices regularly. I consider\nanapanasati my favourite practice. The Buddha taught anapanasati as a potent means to enlightenment,\nand the Buddha continued to practice anapanasati regularly even after his enlightenment.\nWinston asked: \"Is there a diff in how you practice anapanasati compared to standard practice?\"\nSoh: \"Not much difference. But with anatta all sensations are felt directly and gaplessly as an actualization\nof anatta.\nThe eye of directness is not open prior to anatta.\n...\nActually there is a difference. In the past I focused more on nose tips but now the center of attention is\nthe abdominal area. I try to push my energy down (like Vase Breathing). Then the breathing becomes a\nwhole body awareness with some grounding in the abdominal area.\nIn all other aspects its still similar - sensitive to rapture, letting go, tranquilizing mind and body, etc etc\"\nOne should practice Mindfulness of Breathing with the taste of anatta (no-self) and total exertion, one’s\nbreathing is the total exertion of whole body-mind-universe:\n“https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/…/contemplatingobser…\nhttp://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5befored23f60102e2y3.html\n观呼吸 (Contemplating/observing breathing)\n(2012-08-02 11:00:07)\n智者坐在那里观呼吸，\n他不说“我在呼吸”、“我在呼吸”……\n那样是在强化一个虚幻的、不存在的“我”！\n也不符合事实真相。\nThe Wise One sits there contemplating/observing breathing,\nHe does not say \"I am breathing\", \"I am breathing\"....\n1124\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nThat would be solidifying a delusional, non-existent \"self\"!\nAnd it does not match with the truth of things.\n“呼——吸”、“呼——吸”……\n他观察到，其中没有呼吸的人、也没有被呼吸的人。\n呼吸在进行，就像天地起落的风；\n就像风来回在一片枊叶之旁。\n\"Breathe in ------- Breathe out\", \"Breathe in ------- Breathe out\"...\nHe notices that, in it there is no person who is breathing, and there is no person who is being-breathed.\nBreathing is on-going, like the wind rising and falling in the sky and earth (world).\nIt is just like wind going back and forth at the side of a willow leaf.\n在呼吸之中，\n没有一个独立的造作者，也不存在一个承受造作的人。\n是胸，是肺，是骨，是髓，是血，是肉，\n是心、是念……，是诸缘造成了呼吸！\nIn the midst of breathing,\nThere is no independent doer, there does not exist a person who is the feeler of action.\nIt is the chest, it is the lungs, it is the bones, it is the marrow, it is the blood, it is the flesh,\nit is the mind, it is the thought...., it is various conditions that is causing breathing!\n当他长吸气，他了了分明他在长吸气，\n但他不认为是他在吸气，\n是他在吸气的诸缘中，又加入了一个“我作长吸气”的念，\n于是长吸气发生。\n1125\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nWhen he is breathing in long, he clearly comprehends that he is breathing in long,\nbut he does not reckon that it is he who is breathing in,\nRather it is that within the various conditions of his breathing in, one imputes another layer of thought \"I\nam doing the breathing in long\"\nTherefore breathing-in long happens.\n当他长呼气，他了了分明他在长呼气，\n但他不认为是他在呼气，\n是他在呼气的诸缘中，又加入了一个“我作长呼气”的念，\n于是长呼气发生。\nWhen he is breathing out long, he clearly comprehends that he is breathing out long,\nBut he does not reckon that it is he who is breathing out,\nRather it is that within the various conditions of his breathing out, he imputed another layer of thought \"I\nam doing the breathing out long\"\nTherefore breathing-out long happens.\n当他短吸气，他了了分明他在短吸气，\n但他不认为是他在吸气，\n是他在吸气的诸缘中，又加入了一个“我作短吸气”的念，\n于是短吸气发生。\nWhen he is breathing in short, he clearly comprehends that he is breathing in short,\nBut he does not reckon that it is he who is breathing in,\nRather it is that within the various conditions of his breathing in, he imputed another layer of thought \"I\nam doing the breathing in short\"\nTherefore breathing-in short happens.\n当他短呼气，他了了分明他在短呼气，\n1126\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\n但他不认为是他在呼气，\n是他在呼气的诸缘中，又加入了一个“我作短呼气”的念，\n于是短呼气发生。\nWhen he is breathing out short, he clearly comprehends that he is breathing out short,\nBut he does not reckon that it is he who is breathing out,\nRather it is that within the various conditions of his breathing out, he imputed another layer of thought \"I\nam doing the breathing out short\"\nTherefore breathing-out short happens.\n深观呼吸者，归依风界；\n深观呼吸者，了见诸法无我！\n深观呼吸者，看见了因缘法；\n因看见了因缘法，他看见了如来！\nDeeply contemplating the breather, returning and relying/taking refuge in the element of wind/air;\nDeeply contemplating the breather, seeing with insight that all dharmas are without self!\nDeeply contemplating the breather, seeing the dharma of dependent origination;\nBecause of seeing the dharma of dependent origination, he sees the Thus Come One [Buddha]!\n如观呼吸一样，\n智者观想“受、想、行、识”——\n于诸受中，智人不见造作者，不见承受者；\n于“想、行、识”中，也是这样。\nJust like contemplating/observing the breathing,\nThe Wise One contemplates \"feelings, perception, volition and consciousness\" ----\nAnd within all feelings, The Wise One does not conceive of a doer, does not conceive of a feeler;\n1127\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nAnd within \"perception, volition and consciousness\", it is also likewise.\n观呼吸，可以入法界；\n智者深观一切法，皆能通达诸法实相，见证如来！\n呼吸是个入口，\n一切色、受、想、行、识，皆是入口。\nBy contemplating/observing breathing, it is possible to enter the Dharmadhatu;\nThe Wise One deeply contemplates/observes all dharmas, thereby could understand the reality of all\ndharmas, and witness the Thus Come One [Buddha]!\nBreathing is an entry-point,\nAll forms, feelings, perceptions, volition, and consciousness are all entry points.\n智者坐在那里观呼吸，\n他观见虚空藏菩萨，观见风神，\n观见三世一切如来，\n呼——吸、呼——吸，他就像天地。\nThe Wise One sits there contemplating/observing breathing,\nHe perceives the Ākāśagarbha bodhisattva (bodhisattva of boundless space treasury), perceives the god\nof the wind,\nperceives all the Thus Come Ones [Buddhas] of the three times,\nBreathe in --------- Breathe out.

He is just like heaven and earth.”\nThe Buddha’s teaching on Mindfulness of Breathing:\nMajjhima Nikāya 118\nIntroductory Section\n1128\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nThus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park, in the\nPalace of Migāra’s Mother, together with many very well known elder disciples—the venerable Sāriputta,\nthe venerable Mahā Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa, the venerable Mahā Kaccāna, the\nvenerable Mahā Koṭṭhita, the venerable Mahā Kappina, the venerable Mahā Cunda, the venerable\nAnuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable Ānanda, and other very well known elder disciples.\nNow on that occasion elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing new bhikkhus; some elder\nbhikkhus had been teaching and instructing ten bhikkhus, some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and\ninstructing twenty…thirty…forty bhikkhus. And the new bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the elder\nbhikkhus, had achieved successive stages of high distinction.\nOn that occasion—the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, on the full-moon night of the Pavāraṇā ceremony—\nthe Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, surveying the\nsilent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:\n“Bhikkhus, I am content with this progress. My mind is content with this progress. So arouse still more\nenergy to attain the unattained, to achieve the unachieved, to realise the unrealised. I shall wait here at\nSāvatthī for the Komudī full moon of the fourth month.”\nThe bhikkhus of the countryside heard: “The Blessed One will wait there at Sāvatthī for the Komudī full\nmoon of the fourth month.” And the bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course for Sāvatthī to see the\nBlessed One.\nAnd elder bhikkhus still more intensively taught and instructed new bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus\ntaught and instructed ten bhikkhus, some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed twenty…thirty…forty\nbhikkhus. And the new bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus, achieved successive stages\nof high distinction.\nOn that occasion—the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night of the Komudī full moon of the\nfourth month—the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then,\nsurveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:\n“Bhikkhus, this assembly is free from prattle, this assembly is free from chatter. It consists purely of\nheartwood. Such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as is worthy of gifts,\nworthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an incomparable field of merit\nfor the world—such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly that a small gift\ngiven to it becomes great and a great gift greater—such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly.\nSuch an assembly as is rare for the world to see—such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly.\nSuch an assembly as would be worth journeying many leagues with a travel-bag to see—such is this\nSangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly.\n“In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived\nthe holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, destroyed the\n1129\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\nfetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge—such bhikkhus are there in this\nSangha of bhikkhus.\n“In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, are due\nto reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbāna, without ever returning\nfrom that world—such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.\n“In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters and with the\nattenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, returning once to this world to make an end\nof suffering—such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.\n“In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the three fetters, are stream-\nenterers, no longer subject to perdition, bound for deliverance, headed for enlightenment—such\nbhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.\n“In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of the four\nfoundations of mindfulness—such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus. In this Sangha of\nbhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of the four right kinds of striving…of\nthe four bases for spiritual power…of the five faculties…of the five powers…of the seven enlightenment\nfactors…of the Noble Eightfold Path—such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.\n“In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of loving-\nkindness …of compassion…of altruistic joy…of equanimity…of the meditation on foulness…of the\nperception of impermanence—such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus. In this Sangha of\nbhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of mindfulness of breathing.\nMindfulness of Breathing\n“Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and great\nbenefit. When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it fulfils the four foundations of\nmindfulness. When the four foundations of mindfulness are developed and cultivated, they fulfil the\nseven enlightenment factors. When the seven enlightenment factors are developed and cultivated, they\nfulfil true knowledge and deliverance.\n“And how, bhikkhus, is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and\ngreat benefit?\n“Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded\nhis legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful he\nbreathes in, mindful he breathes out.\n1130\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\n“Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe\nout long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands:\n‘I breathe out short.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath’; he trains\nthus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in\ntranquillising the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’\n“He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing rapture’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing\nrapture.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing pleasure’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out\nexperiencing pleasure.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation’; he trains\nthus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation. ’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in\ntranquillising the mental formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the mental\nformation.’\n“He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing\nthe mind.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in gladdening the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out\ngladdening the mind.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in concentrating the mind’; he trains thus: ‘I shall\nbreathe out concentrating the mind.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in liberating the mind’; he trains thus:\n‘I shall breathe out liberating the mind.’\n“He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out\ncontemplating impermanence. ’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating fading away’; he trains\nthus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating fading away.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating\ncessation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating cessation.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in\ncontemplating relinquishment’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment. ’\n“Bhikkhus, that is how mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and\ngreat benefit.\nFulfilment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness\n“And how, bhikkhus, does mindfulness of breathing, developed and cultivated, fulfil the four foundations\nof mindfulness?\n“Bhikkhus, on whatever occasion a bhikkhu, breathing in long, understands: ‘I breathe in long,’ or\nbreathing out long, understands: ‘I breathe out long’; breathing in short, understands: ‘I breathe in short,’\nor breathing out short, understands: ‘I breathe out short’; trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the\nwhole body of breath’; trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath’; trains thus:\n‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation’; trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the\nbodily formation’—on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully\naware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.

Having seen with wisdom\nthe abandoning of covetousness and grief, he closely looks on with equanimity. That is why on that\noccasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,\nhaving put away covetousness and grief for the world.\n“Bhikkhus, that is how mindfulness of breathing, developed and cultivated, fulfils the four foundations of\nmindfulness.\nFulfilment of the Seven Enlightenment Factors\n1132\nMindfulness of Breathing (Anapanasati)\n“And how, bhikkhus, do the four foundations of mindfulness, developed and cultivated, fulfil the seven\nenlightenment factors?\n“Bhikkhus, on whatever occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware,\nand mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world—on that occasion unremitting\nmindfulness is established in him.

When we sit and do meditation practice we focus\nthe mind on an object, typically the breath. In doing this we remove the conditions that support the\nperpetuation of inner chatter. It's like the flower suddenly not getting water any more, over time it slowly\n1134\nCommon Issues in Meditation\ndies. Our inner chatter is the same. Don't think thought that just because you've removed the conditions\nthrough meditation that the chatter will cease straight away. If we stop drinking water it takes a few days\nbefore we really start to feel it, and a week or two before we die. Our inner chatter is the same. In sitting\nmeditation we aren't stopping thought, we are removing certain conditions that support the existence of\nproblems in our lives. In doing this things naturally quieten down on their own and our life naturally feels\nmore alive, more radiant and vibrant. So it's a constant process of letting go whatever house or structure\nyou have around you at that point in time and letting it naturally pass. Peace, happiness and silence\ntherefore aren't things we acquire, this is why we can't go out and seek after them and acquire\nthem, they are the natural properties of our existence when the noise of our lives quietens down.\nSo if you want peace of mind, don't focus on getting peace. If you want happiness, don't focus on getting\nhappiness. You have to focus on meditating diligently and letting go of the house you've build up around\nyou. As the house decays and dies and collapses peace and happiness is revealed.”\n- Dean ‘Jagaro’ Crabb.

This will\nraise your vibrational and energy frequency and bring you to a state of wakeful and alert pure Presence.\nIt can also be a doorway to Maha total exertion, where the chanting vibrates as the universe.” - Soh, 2019\nBuddha gave this teaching to Moggallana while he was still training to attain arahantship (he soon\nbecame an arahant and the foremost disciple of Buddha in psychic powers):\nAs he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to Ven.

And when the currents of supposition do not\nflow, he is said to be a sage at peace.’ Thus it was said. With reference to what was it said? ‘I am’ is a\nsupposition. ‘I am this’ is a supposition. ‘I shall be’ is a supposition. ‘I shall not be’ … ‘I shall be possessed of\nform’ … ‘I shall not be possessed of form’ … ‘I shall be percipient’ … ‘I shall not be percipient’ … ‘I shall be neither\npercipient nor non-percipient’ is a supposition.

Then the wanderer\nJambukhadaka approached the Venerable Sariputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had\nconcluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sariputta:\n\"Friend Sariputta, it is said, 'Nibbana, Nibbana.' What now is Nibbana?\"\n\"The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called Nibbana.\n\"But, friend, is there a path, is there a way for the realization of this Nibbana?\"\n\"There is a path, friend, there is a way for the realization of this Nibbana.\"\n\"And what, friend, is that path, what is that way for the realization of this Nibbana?\"\n1137\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka.

Through looking there, fearful appearances arise, through looking\nhere, ‘self’ arises. Many mistakes arise from the single mistake about the appearances of here and there.\nBecause of being mistaken about a self, there is a mistake about other, attachment to self, aversion to other.\nFrom the seed of attachment and aversion, the whole outer universe and inhabitants are mistakes.\"” – Kyle\nDixon\n1138\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\n(Five poisons: Ignorance, attachment, aversion, pride, jealousy.)\n(Eight worldy concerns: Hope for happiness and fear of suffering. Hope for fame and fear of\ninsignificance. Hope for praise and fear of blame. Hope for gain and fear of loss.)\n“Though anatta is a seal [Soh: i.e. a truth that is always already so, pertaining to the nature of mind/experience],\nit also requires one to arise the insight to feel liberated. When a practitioner realizes the anatta nature of\nmanifestation, at that moment without the sense of observer, there is no negative emotions. There is only\nvivid sensation of all the arising as presence. When you are angry, it is a split. When you realized its anatta\nnature, there is just vivid clarity of all the bodily sensations. Even when there is an arising thought of\nsomething bad, it dissolves with no involvement in the content [Soh: i.e. mental contents like stories,\nimagination and conceptualization along with emotional involvement]. To be angry, a 'someone' must come\ninto the content. When there is no involvement of the extra agent, there is only recoiling and self liberations.\nOne should differentiate arising thought from the active involvement of the content a practitioner that\nrealizes anatta is only involved fully in the vivid presence of the action, phenomena but not getting lost in\ncontent.” - John Tan, 2009\nAlso see J Krishnamurti speaking on awareness without a background observer leads to never being angry\nagain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=share&v=65uft-8u4gU\n“Not creating an idea of a self frees us completely from anger. You cannot have anger unless there is a self.\nThere is no boundless and omniscient self somewhere in the sky that created the whole universe, and there\nis no tangible and limited self that inhabits this bag of skin. All of reality is simply infinite dharmas that arise\nand disappear in accord with the laws of karma. There is not one thing standing against another.” - Zen\nMaster John Daido Loori\n“I am only interested in the way to free from worries, fear, anger, greed and ignorance.” - John Tan, 2018\n“After realization of anatta, I have found that negative emotions dissolves or are attenuated.” - Soh, 2018\nI (Soh) had a further breakthrough in early 2019 that gave the impression that all emotional afflictions have\nbeen eliminated and perfection and purity and joy is experienced 24/7, however, John Tan warned about\nnot coming to premature conclusions and gave the example of living in a condition of chronic pain. His\npoint is that we never know what will happen in the future and how we might react, hence one should not\nmake such claims even if one is confident, hence I avoid making claims. Now writing in late 2019 I can say\nthe breakthrough has been sustained and has been deepening ever more, yet I am not inclined to make\nunnecessary claims. Furthermore I make no claims to finality as I see that my practice is still maturing.\nHowever, the reason I share what I share is because I feel that information should be open and people\nshould know of what is possible in practice. Whereas in the earlier days of my practice I might have been\nslightly skeptical of ‘complete freedom from emotional afflictions’ being possible, I can speak with\nconfidence now that it is possible. Even if one day I feel strong emotions arise again, that will still mean that\n1139\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\n99.99% of my time has been spent in a state of perfection and purity free from suffering and emotional\nafflictions, which is still pretty good. It doesn’t matter at all if you believe me or not and it’s in fact quite\nhealthy to keep some skepticism in my opinion (even I maintain skepticism for myself, this is why I always\navoid making claims of finality like “I am forever free from emotional afflictions”, “I am fully enlightened”, or\nwhatever and instead if a thought of such ever arose it should follow with, “is it really true? hmm…”), but\nstill it might be helpful for your own practice to keep an open mind to the possibilities about the infinite\ndepths of spirituality. However, it is also important to know that my current state is not gotten through\ntrying to eliminate emotions, it is just a side effect of my deepening state of awakening and maturation of\nwisdom and insight. You will not get to where I am by trying to suppress or stop emotions, so get your\nfocus right in terms of practice - developing wisdom and meditative composure. In terms of practice, if\nemotions happen, it is much more helpful to integrate them with/as wisdom than to dissociate from them.\nOne should have a gentle rather than negative attitude with emotions and practice complete openness\nwith emotions, to feel its textures and forms in that moment with vivid clarity and realize its true nature as\nempty-clarity. I can say that I did not chase after freedom from emotional afflictions while practicing, and\nthe clean state of purity after my breakthrough this year was more of a surprise.\n“Actualizing anatta leads to fearlessness. (See: Fearless Samadhi -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/08/fearless-samadhi.html)” - Soh\n“https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2xuq7b/is_nirvana_basically_nonexistence/cp3k7c2/\nNirvana is simply the cessation of craving, aggression, and delusion. Delusion includes the construct of self,\nthat I exist, that I am the perceiver or controller of experiences and actions. Nirvana is not annihilation\nbecause what ends is simply a process of delusional I-making and mine-making and other related mental\nafflictions, it is not the annihilation of some actual self (which never existed).\nNirvana is when, in seeing the seen, it's realized and experienced that there is simply that scenery, and no\nseer. No you in terms of that. In hearing sound, there's simply (always already) only sound, no hearer. In\nthinking... only thought, no thinker. When this is realized, not merely intellectualized, and directly\nexperienced as being so, and all sense of self are being released, then that is Nirvana. This is peace, bliss,\nfreedom from suffering. It is not boring: in fact, boredom only exist when there is a sense of self, and a\nsense of dissatisfaction with what is present, therefore a craving for something to be 'better than what is'.\nThere is a subject and object here: 'I' want 'something better out there'. But when anatta is realized and\nactualized, there is no sense of self, there is no subject and object, no dichotomy of perceiver and perceived,\nand everything is just lucid and luminous and blissful and perfect as it is. Nirvana is also the cessation of\ncraving.\n(For more information check out Bahiya Sutta - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2008/01/ajahn-\namaro-on-non-duality-and.html)\n1140\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nAlso Buddha teaches that we have past lives and future lifetimes, but if you attain Nirvana, you are no\nlonger stuck in this cycle of samsaric rebirth and suffering.” - Soh, 2015\nThere are many misunderstandings of what Nirvana means, even among Buddhists. Read this article to get\na good understanding of what Nirvana means: https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-\nmeaning-of-nirvana.html\n“...This intense apperception has been ongoing in an unbroken way for a month or more, though there has\nbeen a gradual building up for months until a triggering event about a month back when I was\ncontemplating on a PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) that made it go off the roof. The constant mode\nof heightened apperception seems to lessen or blocks out my ability to visualise and imagine. When closing\neyes the state of consciousness is still apperception where only the vivid actuality of blackness is present\nalong with whatever visual (non-imagined) colors imprinted due to lighting. Daydreaming seems gone or\nalmost (if I relax I can still get a few wandering thoughts but that’s it, I cannot really enter into a state of\ndaydreaming) whereas I used to enjoy daydreaming especially when younger, yet I do not think I have 'no\nimagination capacity' (I can still get a faint semblance of an image I used to be able to conjure up with\nconsiderably more effort, it doesn’t come as naturally or easily as before).\nDreams seems to have changed or is changing, I think I am dreaming less, with perhaps less visual content\nthan before (I do not recall much visual contents, however I can't be sure if they completely lack that aspect).\nThe last vivid dream with full on imagery was 1+ months back - I dreamt I was in a lift and that lift failed, I\nwent into a free-fall from the 10th floor to the 1st and I thought I was going to die but I experienced 0 fear,\nanxiety, tenseness, emotions at all. Emotions now seem to have reduced a lot or changed and it is tempting\nat times to think \"this is it, I'm free from affective emotions\" but I still hesitate to make claims about being\nfree from affective emotions as I think I will need more time to observe the changes - IMO the only way to\nget a good gauge of any changes is through time-testing in challenging conditions and utter sincerity (many\nhave dropped claims later on, I would rather not make a claim to have them dropped later, making some\nclaims to finality is not necessary to me). I am not too concerned whether I am there or I am not there, what\nmatters more is the ongoing moment-to-moment actualization of freedom and peace, and if anything that\nhinders freedom arises, then they too can be investigated and dissolved or released with practice. And\ndespite whatever breakthroughs we have in practice, life goes on - there are still so many things to be learnt\nand experienced in life, our new insights and state of consciousness continues to be integrated in various\nways, and so on. It's not some be-all-end-all event in life that marks the end of any further developments\ndown the road. If anything, perhaps it marks a new beginning in life, where life starts to be lived in an ever-\nfresh and pristine manner.\nBut the best thing in terms of affect so far is that the constant apperception is such a joyful, clean, pristine\nstate of appreciating the boundless and radiant world that there isn't room for unpleasant emotions like\nsadness, boredom, depression, etc. There is certainly no more \"Monday blues\" or any kind of \"blues\" at all.\nIt make sense now in my experience when Richard says his days are one perfect day after another. Even\n1141\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nlying on bed, looking at the ceiling, the sound of the humming and background noises is joyful. Any added\nentertainment on top of that perfection is just another addition on top of perfection.” - Soh, 2019\n“Soh: the other day I was investigating fear.. then I saw how fear is tied to the sense of self that feels like its\nexistence needs to be protected.. but upon investigating, that sense of self is completely seen to be a\ncomplete delusional fabrication without basis and then released. It seems to improve my fearlessness…\nJohn Tan: Yes contemplation is a good practice but more importantly is to arise the willingness to let go.\nNot through analysis alone but recognition of the energetic pattern of attachment.\nActually anatta itself is sufficient to dissolve fear, just how deep the insight goes. Ignorance manifests as\nattachment but it is difficult to uproot as seeing through is only at the surface compared to the aeon lives\nof attachments and we constantly re-enforce such view. Wrong view and attachments beget each other\nand one attachment leads to another endlessly. The \"willingness\" that let go must arise to directly feel the\nafflictive chain as a form of energetic pattern, analysis itself is insufficient.”\n“A Pristine World Free from Sufferings\nI have criticised corrupt gurus and institutions for the abuse they inflict. But going by this, there are endless\nthings to criticise in the world, including the horrors that just happened in New Zealand perpetrated by\nextremists of ultra right-wing, islamophobic ideology and white supremacy. It is surely worthy of utmost\ncondemnation by any sensible person. This is the horrors driven by a low level state of consciousness called\n“ethnocentricism” based on the spiral dynamics model, which is a narrow, group-centric identity as opposed\nto a more encompassing, world centric mindset. It is high time that the world evolve out of childish, infantile\nand narrow minded low level states of ethnocentric consciousness to embrace a world centric perspective,\nto focus on the real issues that confront humanity, including issues like climate change which will soon\nthreaten the very survival of civilisation itself. These are all issues that can never be solved if\nethnocentricism continues to be the predominant state of consciousness that humanity is in (and\nunfortunately it still is). Humanity needs to wake up from its slumber.\nBut still, what I’ve said is looking at these issues on the surface, merely the symptoms of a more\nfundamental root cause of suffering and affliction. More fundamentally, the root cause of all the horrors in\nthe world is a mind afflicted by the tendencies towards greed, hatred and delusion. In effect, all afflictive\nactivities are dependently originated not from a self or agency but are activities arising in dependence on\nconditions, particularly a deluded mind that imputes inherent existence on self and phenomena. Cut off\nthe root causes of suffering and you will have peace on earth, a pristine, luminous and pure mind/world\ncompletely rid of any sense that “I exist”, any sense of a self/Self, a world where nobody will be seen as\nenemies as not even the slightest sense of separation remains, and not a trace of hatred and malice\nremains to be found, let alone violence and murder or the need for these “wayward behaviours” to be\npoliced by laws. Such a world is not fantasy, for many today are living proof that it is possible to live in such\n1142\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\npurity, via an inner realization and transformation, as I too am speaking from experience. The sufferings\nand horrors driven by this root cause of ignorance are endless, but all comes forth in dependence on the\nroot cause of ignorance.\nAnd I am saying this not out of desire for self-attention or all that silly nonsense. I have no ambition or the\nslightest desire to be in some role of being a guru. Instead of elevating the status of myself, it is my very\nintention to “normalise” and “demythologize” it, as the people who have attained this are mostly very\nordinary people like you and me, not some 108th reincarnated avatar of the luminous king of vishnu. The\nstate of awakening is utterly accessible and readily attainable by all and sundry. Widespread awakening in\nthe world is possible and hopefully will come to be in times to come.\nI am against setting up an authoritarian structure, as I hold that truth, freedom and liberation is everyone’s\nbirthright and cannot be monopolised or institutionalised by gurus, forms and structure. I do not wish to\nbe someone selling water by the river. However, the least I can do perhaps, is to point out the river - the\npossibility of a shift in consciousness. Life is vastly better for oneself and for others when lived from\nmeasureless mind/universe rather than the narrow confines of a solid and dualistic world of self and other.”\n- Soh\n“I should warn against any tendencies to reject or dissociate from any emotions and mental afflictions.\nDissociation and rejection of anything is not the way of anatta and simply creates a repressed psyche while\nnot addressing the root causes of ignorance driving the chain of afflictions. At the same time, one should\nbe aware that liberation from afflictions is possible, however the causes must be discerned.\nDissociation strengthens the delusional subject-object structure in which a ‘self/Self’ is dissociated from the\nunpleasant aspects of mental experiences, while true insight into anatta and emptiness liberates afflictions\nwithout the slightest dissociation in an effortless manner. The last thing I want is for people to get stuck in\nsome reified transcendent superspace as some avoidance mechanism to unpleasant emotions. In anatta,\nthere is no such delusional transcendent principle to hide out from emotions or whatever unpleasant\nsensations there is. There is only the purity, presence, of sensations, colors, sounds, actions, without\nself/Self. A transcendent superspace, some sort of unaffected Absolute, any sort of an unchanging\nbackground ‘Self’ or ‘Consciousness’ is completely seen through as delusion and ceases permanently. All\nthere is is the transient and radiant stuff of life.\nSo read this chapter with discernment and do not be mistaken that you should ‘train’ to remain in an\nartificially induced emotionless state, for that is like trying to trim the weeds (treat or suppress the\nsymptoms) without uprooting them (dissolve the root causes).” - Soh\n“There is a reason why the stress must be on wisdom and not merely controlling one's emotions. Many\npeople have a wrong understanding of anatta. For example, most people with a shallow understanding of\ndharma mistaken \"truth of anatta\" or \"realization of anatta\" as a state of altruistic egolessness. Someone\n1143\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nmay be very altruistic, unselfish, 'egoless' and perhaps even heroic in the conventional sense but have no\ninkling of the truth of anatta, and thus while such a person may be very developed morally, is not\ndeveloping the front of liberative insights. Liberation in Buddhism requires mastery of all fronts, not just\nmorality, i.e. the three training of shila, samadhi and prajna - roughly translated as morality,\nconcentration/absorption, and wisdom.\nConventional and altruistic egolessness is different from realizing the dharma of seal of anatta as being\nwhat the nature of reality is always already so - empty of self/agent/perceiver/doer behind what's\nexperienced/manifesting in each moment.\nAs John Tan/Thusness have also said in 2010 before my realization of anatta,\n\"(4:46 PM) John Tan: I told you to focus on realization, but you are focusing on the wrong direction.\n(4:46 PM) John Tan: if removing all the desires and passions are all there is, then there is just moral conduct,\nthere is no need for prajna wisdom.\"\n“John Tan: there is the teaching of ignorance, desire, anger as the 3 poisons. You have to eliminate them.\nThere is the teachings of Dependent Origination and prajna wisdom, you have to arise these insights. It is\ntaught that you must eliminate the 3 poisons, why not simply stay with that?\nSoh: You can’t eliminate the 3 poisons without the teaching of Dependent Origination and prajna wisdom\n[i.e. wisdom that realizes no-self and emptiness]\nJohn Tan: how come?\nSoh: prajna wisdom cuts through the ignorant framework of sentient beings which lead to self-grasping\nand attachments -- inherent/dualistic framework\nJohn Tan: so why focus on the effect, the experience” - Conversation in 2010\nAt the same time, one should not be entirely dismissive of the emotional model, and my recent\nbreakthroughs suggest that progression in terms of the emotional model is possible and realistic, although\nI do not want to make claims about my accomplishments (furthermore they need to be tested and observed\nover time).” - Soh, 2019\nOn how to practice with emotions (or in general) without dissociation, see the progression of practices in\nthis article, a good and important read: Reflection and Presence: The Dialectic of Awakening\n“When the correct insights and actualization is present, the effect (of liberating afflictions) is naturally\npresent. But prior to the arising of the correct insights, people may try to mimic the effects, to great\ndetriment - and this is dissociation and suppression happens. Mimicry is not advisable and will not produce\nthe effect as it does not address the causal roots of afflictions.\nRather than practicing wrongly and ending up with psychiatric disorders of the 3Ds (Dissociation,\n1144\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nDepersonalization and Derealization), focus on giving rise to the correct insights and actualize them in\nactual experience. If emotional afflictions still arise, it is far better to practice mindfulness on those\nafflictions with complete acceptance and equanimity than to repress, reject or dissociate from them.\nRepression, rejection and dissociation of any aspect of experience - afflictive or non-afflictive - is wrong\npractice, and one can be assured that one is going in the wrong direction if one is doing that. It should be\nnoted that the four foundations of mindfulness (which is mindfulness directed to every single aspect of\nexperience) taught by Buddha includes mindfulness of the mental states of afflictions and emotions. The\nBuddha has never taught anything like “reject, turn away your attention from them, dissociate or suppress\nthem” but to be mindfulness attentive, aware, of these mental states. “...And how does a monk remain\nfocused on the mind in & of itself? There is the case where a monk, when the mind has passion, discerns,\n‘The mind has passion.’ When the mind is without passion, he discerns, ‘The mind is without passion.’ When\nthe mind has aversion, he discerns, ‘The mind has aversion.’ When the mind is without aversion, he discerns,\n‘The mind is without aversion.’ When the mind has delusion, he discerns, ‘The mind has delusion.’ When\nthe mind is without delusion, he discerns, ‘The mind is without delusion.’...” - Buddha, Satipatthana Sutta” -\nSoh\n“We are all fellow human beings who find ourselves here in the world as it was when we were born. We\nfind war, murder, torture, rape, domestic violence and corruption to be endemic – we notice that it is\nintrinsic to the human condition – and we set out to discover why this is so. We find sadness, loneliness,\nsorrow, grief, depression and suicide to be a global incidence – we gather that it is also inherent to the\nhuman condition – and we want to know why. We all report to each other as to the nature of our discoveries\nfor we are all well-meaning and seek to find a way out of this mess that we have landed in. Whether one\nbelieves in re-incarnation or not, we are all living this particular life for the very first time, and we wish to\nmake sense of it. It is a challenge and the adventure of a life-time to enquire and to uncover, to seek and\nto find, to explore and to discover. All this being alive business is actually happening and we are totally\ninvolved in living it out ... whether we take the back seat or not, we are all still doing it. I, for one, am not\ntaking the back seat ... because it is indeed possible for any human being to be totally free from the human\ncondition.\n…\nThe day finally dawns where the definitive moment of being here, right now, conclusively arrives; something\nirrevocable takes place and every thing and every body and every event is different, somehow, although\nthe same physically; something immutable occurs and every thing and every body and every event is all-\nof-a-sudden undeniably actual, in and of itself, as a fact; something irreversible happens and an immaculate\nperfection and a pristine purity permeates every thing and every body and every event; something has\nchanged forever, although it is as if nothing has happened, except that the entire world is a magical\nfairytale-like playground full of incredible gladness and a delight which is never-ending.\n1145\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nPut succinctly: ‘my’ demise was as fictitious as ‘my’ apparent presence; I have always been here, in this\nactual world of sensorial delight, one realises, for it was that ‘I’ only imagined ‘I’ existed; ‘my’ presence had\nbeen but an emotional/ passional play in a fertile imagination; an emotional/ passional play which fuelled\nactual hormonal substances, however, triggered off from within the brain-stem by the instinctual emotions/\npassions bestowed per favour blind nature. Thus the psyche – the entire affective faculty born of the\nsurvival instincts themselves – is wiped out forever and one is finally what one has actually been all along:\na sensitive and reflective flesh-and-blood body simply brimming with sense organs revelling in this\nsensuous world of immediate experience. As this flesh-and-blood body only one is this infinite, eternal, and\nperdurable universe experiencing itself as an apperceptive human being ... as such it is stunningly aware\nof its own infinitude. And this is truly wonderful.\nThus the search for meaning amidst the debris of the much-vaunted human hopes and dreams and\nschemes has come to its timely end. With the end of both ‘I’ and ‘me’, the distance or separation between\nboth ‘I’ and ‘me’ and these sense organs – and thus the external world – disappears. To be living as the\nsenses is to live a clear and clean awareness – apperception – a pure consciousness experience of the world\nas-it-is. Because there is no ‘I’ as a thinker (a little person inside one’s head) or a ‘me’ as a feeler (a little\nperson in one’s heart) – to have sensations happen to them, I am the sensations. The entire affective faculty\nvanishes ... blind nature’s software package of instinctual passions is deleted. There is nothing except the\nseries of sensations which happen ... not happening to an ‘I’ or a ‘me’ but just happening ... moment by\nmoment ... one after another. To live life as these sensations, as distinct from having them, engenders the\nmost astonishing sense of freedom and magic. Consequently, I am living in peace and tranquillity; a\nmeaningful peace and tranquillity. Life is intrinsically purposeful, the reason for existence lies openly all\naround. Being this very air I live in, I am constantly aware of it as I breathe it in and out; I see it, I hear it, I\ntaste it, I smell it, I touch it, all of the time. It never goes away – nor has it ever been away – it was just that\n‘I’ and/or ‘me’ was standing in the way of the meaning of life being apparent.\nLife is not a vale of tears.” - Richard Maynard of The Actual Freedom Trust\n\"...The anatta definitely severed many emotional afflictions, for the most part I don't have negative\nemotions anymore. And either the anatta or the strict shamatha training has resulted in stable shamatha\nwhere thoughts have little effect and are diminished by the force of clarity. I'm also able to control them,\nstopping them for any amount of desired time etc. But I understand that isn't what is important. Can I fully\nopen to whatever arises I would say yes. I understand that every instance of experience is fully appearing\nto itself as the radiance of clarity, yet timelessly disjointed and unsubstantiated..\" - Kyle Dixon, 2013\nSomeone had the misunderstanding that Kyle Dixon is a “follower” of Soh and John Tan. Soh clarified,\n“Kyle Dixon is not a student or follower of mine or John Tan in any way. His realizations happened prior to\nhis encountering us, about eight years ago. He is a dzogchen practitioner and I am not. The fact that our\ninsights coincide is simply a coincidence. There are some others who have had insights triggered by my\n1146\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nwritings, but Kyle is not one of them. Furthermore, I do not have “students”. I also do not claim “full\nenlightenment”.” Kyle has written a very nice account back in 2012 of his own realization: Advice from Kyle\nDixon - https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2014/10/advise-from-kyle_10.html\n(Update: Kyle Dixon learnt Dzogchen from Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and since around 2012 has started\nlearning from Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith. Had the good karma to meet Malcolm and Kyle in\nCalifornia in 2019 [completely coincidental because Malcolm does not live there and just happened to be\nvisiting]. Malcolm said Kyle is the first to totally understand his teachings. Also, in 2020 John Tan and I\nstarted attending Malcolm’s Dzogchen teachings which we think is very clear: http://www.zangthal.com/,\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2014/02/clarifications-on-dharmakaya-and-basis_16.html .\nAlthough I would add, Kyle did say he had learnt things from John Tan and I too. But I would say it is not\nsome sort of formal student-teacher relation. I have learnt many things from Kyle too.)\n“The conditions for this subtle identification are not undone until anatta is realized.\nAnatta realization is like a massive release of prolonged tension, this is how John put it once at least. Like a\ntight fist, that has been tight for lifetimes, is suddenly relaxed. There is a great deal of power in the event.\nThe nature of this realization is not often described in traditional settings, I have seen Traga Rinpoche\ndiscuss it. Jñāna is very bright and beautiful. That brightness is traditionally the “force” that “burns” the\nkleśas.\nThe reservoir of traces and karmic imprints is suddenly purged by this wonderful, violent brightness. After\nthis occurs negative emotions are subdued and for the most part do not manifest anymore. Although this\nis contingent upon the length of time one maintains that equipoise.” - Kyle Dixon, 2019\n“Prajñā “burns” karma, only when in awakened equipoise. Regular meditation does not.” - Kyle Dixon,\n2021\nHow Emptiness Liberates Afflictions\nTaken from Reddit:\n“Qn: I’m often wondering how understanding necessarily emptiness changes the way we relate to\nphenomena. For instance, how does this realization make my mind free from afflictions like anger,\ncraving, clinging and so on?\nKyle (Krodha) replied:\nAnger, craving and clinging are activities that in most cases, assume a subject-object duality. There is the\nassumption of a self that is interacting with objects, and that this self-entity as an agent can crave, cling,\nbecome angry at a foreign object or person that exists separately (from said self).\n1147\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nThe experiential realization of emptiness collapses this subject-object duality so that there is no\nexperience of a substantial inner reference point relating to external phenomena. The realization of\nemptiness also nullifies external entities, and reveals that outer phenomena are misconceptions,\nabstractions. Both sides of the dichotomy are uprooted, the self that can become angry, or crave, and the\nexternal phenomena to become angry at, crave or cling to... both sides are seen as a misconception or\nabstraction.\nEmptiness is like awakening to realize that the appearance of a snake lying on the ground in a dark room\nis actually just a rope. Prior to recognizing the nature of that appearance, the alleged snake was capable\nof conjuring all sorts of emotions, fear, curiosity, worry, and so on. However, once the lights are turned\non, and it is recognized that the snake was actually a rope all along, then the basis for fear, curiosity,\nworry and any other emotions or activities related to a snake are all evaporated instantly - because they\nwere all predicated on a misconception.\nIn the same way, in realizing emptiness the basis for anger, craving and clinging would be evaporated\ninstantly because they are also predicated on misconceptions.”\nKyle: “The Samādhirāja cited earlier says:\nYoung man, bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have become skilled in the wisdom of the nonexistent nature\nof all phenomena do not have desire for any form, sound, smell, taste, or touch. They do not become\nangry. They are never ignorant.\nWhy is that? It is because they do not see phenomena; there is no object to perceive. They do not see the\nphenomena of desire, the desire, or the desirer; that which angers, the anger, or one who is angry; nor\nthat of which one is ignorant, the ignorance, or the one who is ignorant, and therefore there is no such\nobject to perceive.\nBecause there is nothing to be seen and there is no object to perceive, they have no attachment to\nanything in the three realms and they will quickly attain this samādhi, and quickly attain the highest,\ncomplete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.\nOn this topic, it has been said: All phenomena have no existence; They are all devoid of attributes and\nwithout characteristics, without birth and without cessation. That is how you should perfectly understand\nphenomena. Everything is without existence, without words, empty, peaceful, and primordially stainless.\nThe one who knows phenomena, young man, that one is called a buddha.”\n“I’m not qualified to give any sort of medical advice but sounds like you’d benefit from either continuing\nwith some sort of medication schedule or if you choose to go without meds, at the very least have a\ntherapist you can engage with on a regular basis.\n1148\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nBuddhadharma is great, and in certain degrees of realization does actually eliminate negative emotions\nso that they aren’t experienced at all. They are “tamed” (damya) so that you form a deep mental and\nemotional resilience once you reach the level of “patience” (kṣānti). This occurs on what is called the third\nbhūmi, negative emotions no longer manifest at all. I only say that to share that buddhadharma is in fact\na means to an end in terms of conquering emotional turmoil. That said, those are higher realizations, and\nyou shouldn’t bet your mental wellbeing on that type of attainment at this present time. It is better to\ntake measures to find some emotional equanimity and overall peace, even if that means medication and\ntherapy.” – Kyle Dixon to a redditor\n…\n“On hand I have this:\nThe Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra states:\nAffecting the mind, kleśa and vāsanā can be destroyed only by a wisdom [prajñā], a certain form of\nomniscience [sarvajñatā].\nThere is a lesser form of prajñā that is able to eradicate the kleśas, and then a superior form of prajñā\nthat destroys vāsanās. Only buddhas possess the superior form and have therefore dispelled both the\nkleśas and vāsanās.\nThe Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra continues:\nThere is no difference between the different destructions of the conflicting emotions [kleśaprahāna].\nHowever, the Tathāgatas, arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas have entirely and definitively cut all the\nconflicting emotions [kleśa] and the traces that result from them [vāsanānusaṃdhi]. The śrāvakas and\npratyekabuddhas themselves have not yet definitively cut vāsanānusaṃdhi... these vāsanās are not really\nkleśas. After having cut the kleśas, the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas still retain a small part of them:\nsemblances of love (attachment) [rāga], hate (aversion) [dveṣa] and ignorance [moha] still function in their\nbody [kāya], speech [vāc] and mind [manas]: this is what is called vāsanānusaṃdhi. In foolish worldly\npeople [bālapṛthagjana], the vāsanās call forth disadvantages [anartha], whereas among the śrāvakas and\npratyekabuddhas they do not. The Buddhas do not have these vāsanānusaṃdhi.” - Kyle Dixon, 2021\n“PW wrote: \"From investigation, it seems that \"intention\" appears spontaneously due to past conditioning\ninteracting with ongoing current/present circumstances. \"\nSoh replied: Not just past but also present conditioning. Nothing is fatalistic since unwholesome and\nunskillful qualities of mind, speech and action can utterly cease, both temporarily in our practices and\npermanently which requires the unfolding of prajna wisdom. That (the liberation of the three unwholesome\nroots - greed, hatred and delusion driving the various unwholesome thoughts, speech and actions, causing\nall manners of suffering) is the whole point of practicing the noble eightfold path\n(https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN45_8.html), otherwise why even practice?\nPW: Hmm, but if our actions already bear fruit of past and present conditioning, how does unskillful action\ncease [if they are] no other than causes/conditions of skillful action ripening due to past skillful karmic deeds?\nAre not the seeds already planted and it's just a matter of witnessing manifestation unfold and the fruits of\naction to take place?\n1149\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nSoh: Actually you need to study the twelve links of dependent origination.\nIgnorance drives the afflictive cycle of birth. The taints are the underlying tendencies towards grasping,\ncraving, aversion, and other manners of afflictions. Ignorance and taints support each other. Through\nwisdom, ignorance is abandoned and the taints and its manifestations including the three unwholesome\nroots, the unwholesome actions that derive from them and their results cease.\nBut as a concrete example, I can say that after anatta realization, for the past eight years there is no way I\ncould intentionally kill or injure another being, even insects. There is no self/Self here, and beings are not\nseen as external to oneself or as enemies (but I do not subsume everyone and everything to be extensions\nof a cosmic all-pervasive Self as in John Tan Stage 1 to 4, there is simply no identities here whatsoever, be\nit an egoic individual self or a cosmic all-pervasive Self with the capital ‘S’), but gaplessly (as in without the\nslightest sense of a gap between a subjective perceiver and a perceived object) and directly experienced as\nclose as one's heartbeat, which is to say not even the slightest sense of distance or separation whatsoever.\nAnd I have not experienced even the slightest sense of a subject/object split or agency for the past 8 years.\nIn actualizing this there can be no intention of harming just like one does not harm one's body.\nRead this sutta (teaching of Buddha) on the 12 links:\nhttps://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.ntbb.html\nThe Wholesome and the Unwholesome\n3. \"When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome, the root of the unwholesome, the\nwholesome, and the root of the wholesome, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who\nhas perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.\n4. \"And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the unwholesome, what is the wholesome,\nwhat is the root of the wholesome? Killing living beings is unwholesome; taking what is not given is\nunwholesome; misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome; false speech is unwholesome; malicious\nspeech is unwholesome; harsh speech is unwholesome; gossip is unwholesome; covetousness is\nunwholesome; ill will is unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome.

In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect\nconfidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma.\"\nPW: That's super interesting. That answers my other post. My teacher mentioned about refraining from\nkilling ants after I mentioned that I had setup bait because a bunch of them invaded my kitchen. He\nproposed the idea of skillfully sealing off their entrances.\nLooks like I still have a lot of work to do, things to realize, and room to grow. Glad I came across you and\nthis forum. It's been a steady positive influence in helping me understand.\nPW later wrote: I was re-reading the twelve links of dependent origination. It seems to recommend the\ncessation or stopping of all of the various links anywhere along the chain, so to end all causes and effects.\nIt came across a bit anti-life to me. So is it basically saying it's better to have not existed in the first place?\nTo stop all appearances and phenomenon. To stop the cycle of physical birth and death, since along with it\ncomes the whole mass of suffering. Or is it talking about the birth and death of the sense of \"I\"?\nAssuming it's the physical that's being referred, does that mean to achieve this, is to be snuffed out of\nexistence and to be eternally nothing? Or to get snuffed out of existence and to realize you are essentially\neverything and eternal?\nAnd then what happens upon death since the cycle has been escaped, is what remains the eternal bliss of\nnothingness?\nSoh replied: The Buddha was not averse to life. But he was also not craving for becoming or existence. If\nyou are anti-life in the sense of becoming averse to life, then you crave for annihilation, which is another\nextreme.\nHe advises the ending of craving and the process of birth or becoming.\nIt’s about coming to peace. Free from craving, fear, aversion, grasping, conceit or sense of I AM or I shall be.\n1151\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nHe does not generate volition towards either being or non-being.\nBuddha:\n“...22. “He understands thus: ‘If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified and bright, to the base of infinite\nspace and to develop my mind accordingly, this would be conditioned. If I were to direct this equanimity,\nso purified and bright, to the base of infinite consciousness … to the base of nothingness … to the base of\nneither-perception-nor-non-perception and to develop my mind accordingly, this would be conditioned.’\nHe does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or non-being. Since\nhe does not form any condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or non-being, he\ndoes not cling to anything in this world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agitated,\nhe personally attains Nibbāna. He understands thus: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what\nhad to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’”\nAnd:\nBuddha said in Dhātuvibhanga Sutta: The Exposition of the Elements\nhttps://www.wisdompubs.org/book/middle-length-discourses-buddha/selections/middle-length-\ndiscourses-140-dhatuvibhanga-sutta\n28. “Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced covetousness, desire, and lust; now he has abandoned\nthem, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer\nsubject to future arising. Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced anger, ill will, and hate; now he has\nabandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are\nno longer subject to future arising. Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced ignorance and delusion; now\nhe has abandoned them, cut them off [246] at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so\nthat they are no longer subject to future arising. Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this peace] possesses the\nsupreme foundation of peace. For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble peace, namely, the pacification of lust, hate,\nand delusion.\n29. “So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not neglect wisdom, should preserve truth,\nshould cultivate relinquishment, and should train for peace.’\n30. “‘The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations], and when the tides\nof conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.’ So it was said. And with reference to what\nwas this said?\n31. “Bhikkhu, ‘I am’ is a conceiving; ‘I am this’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall not be’ is a\nconceiving; ‘I shall be possessed of form’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be formless’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be percipient’\nis a conceiving; ‘I shall be non-percipient’ is a conceiving; ‘I shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’ is a\nconceiving. Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a tumour, conceiving is a dart. By overcoming all conceivings,\n1152\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nbhikkhu, one is called a sage at peace. And the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die; he is not\nshaken and is not agitated. For there is nothing present in him by which he might be born. Not being born, how\ncould he age? Not ageing, how could he die? Not dying, how could he be shaken? Not being shaken, why should\nhe be agitated?\n32. “So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands\nupon these [foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is called a sage at peace.’\nBhikkhu, bear in mind this brief exposition of the six elements.”\nBuddha is equanimous and does not give rise to craving or aversion to whatever manifests in experience:\n“He remains focused on feelings… mind… mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent,2 alert,3 &\nmindful4—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world.”\nGiving rise to aversion with regards to aversion does not cause the end of aversion. The path of abandoning\nafflictions is through insight of things as they are.” - Conversation in the Awakening to Reality Discussion\nGroup\n“The 10 fetters are removed by the perfection of 戒定慧 (precepts, samadhi and wisdom) in Theravada\nteaching… ...so in addition to that [insight], you must also practice samadhi for tranquility and calm” - John\nTan, 2011\nThe Buddha taught that the cultivation of both tranquility and insight is necessary for the abandoning of\nafflictions.\nVijja-bhagiya Sutta: A Share in Clear Knowing\n\"These two qualities have a share in clear knowing. Which two? Tranquillity (samatha) & insight (vipassana).\n\"When tranquillity is developed, what purpose does it serve? The mind is developed. And when the mind is\ndeveloped, what purpose does it serve? Passion is abandoned.\n\"When insight is developed, what purpose does it serve? Discernment is developed. And when discernment\nis developed, what purpose does it serve? Ignorance is abandoned.\n\"Defiled by passion, the mind is not released. Defiled by ignorance, discernment does not develop. Thus\nfrom the fading of passion is there awareness-release. From the fading of ignorance is there discernment-\nrelease.\"\nHowever, be cautious about over-claiming, as Daniel Ingram has this to say about Actual Freedom teachings:\n1153\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nhttps://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-v-awakening/37-models-of-the-stages-of-\nawakening/the-simple-model/\n“Here I would like to tell a little story, a summary and simplification of a situation that unfolded over a few\nyears. I knew four people, three were friends of mine before all this began, and two were people whose\npractices I knew quite well. They all began following a teaching in which a person claimed to have eliminated\nall emotions entirely. These four were good people, strong practitioners, and appeared honestly inspired\nby a practice that seemed straightforwardly helpful: notice feelings as they arise, see what causes them\nand how they function, and notice how they seem to relate to a sense of a self, with an emphasis on bodily\nawareness of those feelings and a commitment to being very present all day long and enjoying being here\nnow.\nThe interesting thing is that all four of these people within a year or so of having started this practice\nclaimed to have done it, and by “it” I mean eliminated all emotions entirely, replacing them with a\nperpetually wonderful perception of the freshness of the sensate world, a lack of time pressure, a reduced\nneed for sleep, and some other benefits and odd side effects. This caused quite a stir in my community,\nbut I was totally intrigued and impressed. Being willing to keep an open mind and revise my impressions\nas needed in the face of the seemingly honest reports of my fellow adventurers, I spent a reasonable\namount of time with some of them trying to figure out exactly what they had done and how they did it, as\nwell as adopting the basic practice of deeply embodying feelings as a focus all day long, and appreciating\nthe sensuous beauty of the freshness of the sensate world; basically mindfulness of emotions and\nemphasizing rapture. I must say, it was in general a fun and interesting practice that seemed grounded on\nsound basic principles. I experienced various beneficial relative effects, but the elimination of emotions\nwasn’t one of them.\nTime passed, however, and one by one, the four renounced their claims to have eliminated all emotions,\nwith each stating something along the lines of having realized that their model had caused them to be in\ndenial of what they were actually feeling to some degree. All four later arrived at the conclusion that the\npeople who had inspired them were also clearly not free of emotions. One of the four ended up with some\nlong-lasting psychological complexities, though the remaining three did better, and two of them did say\nthat they did change something useful in the way that emotions were experienced, though the elimination\nof emotions was not that something.\nSo ended an interesting saga, but the end result, at least from my point of view, has led to four conclusions:\n1) Beware of the limited emotional range models!\n2) Investigating the sensuous beauty of reality, emphasizing rapture, and tuning in to the freshness of the\nsensate world, the body, and its feelings can be a fun and rewarding practice.\n3) Be careful with claims of having done something final before really giving reality time to show you what\nsubtleties and complexities remain.\n1154\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\n4) Strong, dedicated, intelligent practitioners can be led astray and confused by golden promises of the\nspiritual marketplace, just like anyone else, so keep reality testing your practices to see how they hold up.\nI know of a few other people (some of whom I have met, some by reports of good friends who have met\nthem) who still claim to have eliminated all emotions (as well as nearly all thought), though those who have\nspent time with them all say that they still appear to have emotions, and can be moody, snippy, arrogant,\nand the like, just as anyone else can. Can I be certain I know exactly what is going on with them regarding\ntheir internal experience? Obviously not. Am I very skeptical? Yes, I am. However, in the interest of fairness,\nI present these examples just so that you can do your own research and realize that there is still controversy\nabout this. Best of luck sorting it out for yourself. Regardless, the ability to modulate responses to emotions\nskillfully can sometimes give the impression that these emotions have been attenuated or eliminated, but\nthat ability and emotional elimination are not the same thing.” - Daniel M. Ingram\nAlso, this article by Daniel M. Ingram is a good read with good advice: My Experiment in Actualism-\nInfluenced Practice, by Daniel M. Ingram, September 20th, 2013\n“The topic is very complicated.\nAttempting an extremely quick summary of a possibly very long discussion:\nIf you stick to reasonable first principles, such as paying gentle, kind attention to what you are feeling and\nwondering why (being mindful and inquisitive regarding of feelings and mind states), paying attention to\nhow you are experiencing this moment of being alive (mindfulness and investigation of your immediate\nsensate world), paying attention to something pleasant about experience (cultivating rapture), and the like,\nthen it is hard to go far wrong, and many who do these have noticed benefits.\nIf you begin to chase emotional elimination, then it is definitely true that people here and other places have\nreported some mild to severe problems as a result of that fixation and focus, as denial and repression are\nsticky and tempting traps to be ensnared by, as JC points out.\nBest wishes sorting all this out.\nDefinintely keep your wits about you and listen to the feedback of those around you.\nDaniel” - Daniel M. Ingram, https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-\n/message_boards/message/14283510\nHow should one practice while facing emotions? See the advice by Jean Klein and John Tan:\n“Questioner: In certain situations in life I feel blocked by a fear which prevents me from acting. How can I\n1155\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nbe free from this obstacle?\nJean Klein: First free yourself from the word, the concept, 'fear'. It is loaded with memory. Face only the\nperception. Accept the sensation completely. When the personality who judges and controls is completely\nabsent, when there is no longer a psychological relationship with the sensation, it is really welcomed and\nunfolds. Only in welcoming without a welcomer can there be real transformation. We are in essence one\nwith all existence; when we truly observe ourselves there is ultimately no observer, only observation -\nawareness.\nIn simple openness which is welcoming you will come to accept and get to know your negative feelings,\ndesires and fears. Once welcomed and nondirected attention to these feelings will burn themselves up,\nleaving only silence.” - Jean Klein\n\"Fear is just like Self, is a process being molded into a label. What hides behind this label is a vivid process\nof involvement, interplay between the causes, conditions giving rise to all appearances. The activity is alive\nand vivid. The flow of blood, the pulsating of the heart beats, the humming of the aircon, the cold air\ntouches the skin, awareness is all these. It is a mere knowingness without effort to recognize anything, it is\none whole sensing. All true knowledge must evolve from the mere Presence.\" - John Tan, 2006\n“RICHARD: Of course the word ‘fear’ is not fear itself ... it is a name for it so that we can communicate. Do\nyou take me to be an idiot? Some other correspondent came out with similar twaddle (offering me the word\n‘coffee’ instead of the actual substance) and this is just as silly. Look, fear is the adrenaline coursing through\nyour veins; the heart pumping furiously; the palms sweaty; the face blanched white; knuckles gripped; body\ntensed and so on and so on. Observing this, in both oneself and in others – and in animals – this is ‘observing\nwith the objectivity of a scientist’.” - http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-\nfear.htm\n“You must be able to feel the crowd. If not how are you to understand riots. Have you seen people gambled\nhorse before? They see the race, They stood up. You look at their face... Turned red...shooting. As if under\na spell. Shooting and shooting. Otherwise how are you to feel and understand? Otherwise what you know\nis only theory. Get it? This is how anatta is. You are having too much thoughts, therefore you can't know.\nYou do not understand what is meant by \"stirring\" up emotions. If you see without understanding then you\nare seeing with disassociation. You must learn to see with full engagement yet without attachment.” - John\nTan, 2019\n[3/2/18, 1:58:36 AM] John Tan: Just replied Yacine,\nMany of the ways you described have the tendency of attempting to reason out something even when\ndealing with surrendering or visualization except 1. Taking a deep breath.\nYou are unable to see “fear” as energy. Using your “felt sense” to understand “fear” directly.\n1156\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nWhen you take a deep breath, must you “think” or “understand” anything to overcome fear? Must intellect\nbe involved?\nFor example by seeing peaceful Buddha images, a feeling of calm fills the entire body-mind.\n[3/2/18, 2:00:39 AM] John Tan: He won't be able to understand anything, if \"energy\" and \"clarity\" is left\nout. Attempting to understand by pure intellect alone is a wrong approach.\n[3/2/18, 2:02:26 AM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[3/2/18, 8:21:12 AM] John Tan: Some of my approaches:\n1. By doing deep breathing exercises\n2. By doing yoga\n3. By sincerely surrendering to higher power\n4. By fully facing and accepting the worse situation\n5. By chanting\n6. By vipassana meditation\nFear can also be understood from the perspective of energy. Means you can recognise the energy\npattern of surrendering, compassion, openness, peace or even anger to counter, transform or release\n“fear”. It may not involve the “intellect” at all.\nIn fact if you work with “energy”, you will realise thoughts and stories are the result of energy imbalances.\nWhen you have lack of energy or the body is experiencing energy imbalances, negative thoughts and\nstories will keep popping up beyond control.\nI am not telling you to look into energy practice, but want you to understand the approach of logic and\nreasoning is one way but not the only way. To have intimate understanding of your\nmind/consciousness/spirit may require more than “intellect” or worst still, may sometimes require you to\nsuspend the intellect to get it. To understand suffering for example, you may not want to use logical\ninduction or deduction to understand it, you have to open your heart to feel it.\n“Daniel's MCTB 4 path is not based on fetter model. The traditional Theravada 4 path is a 10 fetter model\nwhich is quite similar to AF [actual freedom] emotional model. So when Richard claimed complete\nelimination and overcoming of all emotions and achieved actual freedom, that sounds very much an\narahat to me.\nAs for the phases of insights, I do not equate phase 5 insight as arhant and far from it. I also do not map\nthe phases of insight according to any model, it is not meant for that purpose. It is simply a journey of\nexploring the breadth and depth of Presence and how the arising insights of anatta and emptiness turn\nout to be key.\nIn what way the phases of insight can help in eliminating the fetters imo (in my opinion) is very much\ndependent on the conditions of the individual, it may not manifest the same way for different people.” -\nJohn Tan, 2019\n1157\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka.

I think you are saying these still arise and have to see it’s dependent arising?\n[23/3/19, 6:18:10 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Anyway maybe this anatta effect will be gone tomorrow or 90 days.. lol.\nI’m certainly not saying it’s permanent\n[23/3/19, 6:20:18 PM] John Tan: Emotions or not doesn't matter. Conduct is important. I have no\nattachment in groups or fame in spirituality. I do not wish to be known that is the best but writing those\nphases of insights have caused lots of karma...lol\n[23/3/19, 6:20:38 PM] Soh Wei Yu: lol I understand\n[23/3/19, 6:23:01 PM] John Tan: I am actually not worried nor emotional who says what about me, I am\nmore worried about you...lol.

Lol. To me that\nrequires more wisdom.\n[23/3/19, 6:39:46 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. But then emotionless is good in the sense of no fear, no sadness,\nhate, etc. But I don’t see any problems with loving kindness and gratitude.. I’m grateful but currently not\nin a very emotional way.. means these healthy emotional aspects have to be cultivated? I think non\nclinging is more important.

When one is not subject to\nadverse conditions, we tend to over claim and that is a sign of immaturity. Not achievement. Anyway, just\npractice wholeheartedly and not overclaim. If you truly want people to have non-dual and effortless\nexperience in presence, just write about your experience. No need to comment on others achievement.\nYou can tell people thusness is not there yet because he told you he has full of emotions... lol.

I remember I used to [be able to] feel\n“shitty” but this state is simply of perfection. But I agree with you even emotions is the radiance and if\nthey come up here there will be no repression.. I don’t want to suppress emotions lol\n[23/3/19, 7:40:49 PM] John Tan: There is no need to, but mistaking it as a goal is the issue. Conditions are\ninfinite, our attachments are subtle. And often difficult to detect. We should not overclaim and the\ninability to contain oneself is already a sign of one's lack of practice. Attracted to PCE (Pure Consciousness\nExperience) too. I experience so intense radiance several times but who knows about it.\n[23/3/19, 7:43:32 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic yeah I definitely think I’m a little attracted to PCE (Pure\nConsciousness Experience) now.. maybe after a while I’ll get over it\n[23/3/19, 7:44:15 PM] John Tan: The inability to contain it is already a sign of one's immature practice.\nRather than getting too excited, look into what exactly give rise to those results. If one day we are old, our\neyes can't see and eyes can't hear, can’t walk… all these are normal conditions in old age. How our state\nof mind will be we do not know… even if you are confident, we do not claim. I am not saying that\ncriticising traditions or masters is wrong by the way. Lol. However saying or suggesting the phases of\ninsights are beyond them is not ok… lol\n[23/3/19, 8:08:42 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic yeah I made clear in a post this morning that all the Buddhist\ntraditions are in line with anatta and emptiness even though most of the modern Teachers are not... lol\n[23/3/19, 8:09:30 PM] John Tan: Yeah I read\n[24/3/19, 11:17:05 PM] John Tan: From the perspective of clarity, it is true that Buddhism anatta and\nemptiness is more profound and deep… lol. But still good to caution about respecting all religions and\npractice. Why empty clarity is only pointed out in buddhism. So although it is true about all points to pure\nconsciousness, it is realizing the emptiness that is the prajna eye to allow us to clearly see the empty\nnature of clarity. Otherwise we will most likely land in alaya or [be] required to still in deep stillness of\nsamadhi.\n(On this point, I was reminded of something John Tan said back in I think 2012:\n\"Every religion is talking about consciousness. It is the nature of consciousness that is important. It is like\ntalking about “Soh'' from different people. Of course all is pointing to \"Soh\" but when someone say he is\nan American, has 10 sisters and is now studying in India… we cannot say that he is correct and it is the\nsame because ultimately we are talking about \"Soh\".\")”\n“Yes sahaja samadhi but that remain as \"experience\". Just like in taoism, it is all about naturalness 自然\nand non-action (action without agent) though there are overlaps but they are different in praxis and view\nessentially. There is no need to forcefully integrate the various religions into one, that is just more\nattachment.\nAlthough there is no monopoly over truth as ultimately all is/are talking about one's primordial nature but\nthere are those that much clearer and precise in their system of practice. If the views and philosophies\n1160\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nare 90% inherent and dualistic, the result from such a system will at best be a stage to be achieved albeit\nthe emphasis of “natural state”.\nAs I said before, if someone were to say \"Soh is a malay, a speckie, used to be a c# programmer, 1.9m tall\nand has a sister\", obviously some informations are correct and some are misleading. Even if you were to\nstand right in front of him, he will not be able to recognize you. Therefore although all are talking about\nthe natural condition of pristine consciousness, some are exceptionally clearer than others.” – John Tan,\n2020\nKyle Dixon wrote:\n“There are different types of spiritual awakening, and liberation is even defined differently in different religions\nand systems. The point is that liberation as defined by the buddhadharma is only available to those who\nengage in the methodologies of the buddhadharma in accordance with right view and so on. Principally\ndependent origination [pratītyasamutpāda], which is an exclusively Buddhist view.\nLike Buddhapālita states:\nBecause we [Buddhists], in the correct way, see the nonexistence of the self existence of things which appear\nbecause the sun of dependent origination arose, because of that, because we see the truth, liberation can be\naccepted only for us.”\nJohn Tan commented: Yes. 👍\n“Soma999 wrote:Hi Malcolm,\nI am quiet surprised by your answer.\nIn the Bhagavad Gita - quiet a major scripture - for exemple, the liberation presented, and which is quiet\nstrongly adopted by many schools, is a freedom from the circle of birth and death.\nMalcolm replied: Yes, of course, all Indian schools who propose liberation propose that liberation means\nfreedom from the cycles of birth and death.\nBuddha disagreed with all of these schools completely, and taught it was only through adopting right\nview, i.e., the four truths of nobles, that one could attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death.\nHe taught that they mistook various types of mental states for liberation, mental states which in some\ncases last millions and millions of years.\nThe Bhgavada Gita for example, is an example of an eternalist scripture, and it proposes the best way to\nachieve liberation is through pure devotion to Krishna as embodiment of Godhead, though it lists other\npaths as well.\nSaṃkhya is described as an incorrect view because it proposes that causes and effects are merely\n1161\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\ntransformations of one substance. Yoga also suffers from this view.\nJainism is clearly refuted by the Buddha. This is a no brainer. The Buddha thought that Mahathera was a\ncomplete fool.\nNyaya and Vaishesika did not exist during the time of the Buddha, but their eternalist atomism was\nsoundly negated by later Buddhist scholars such as Bhavaviveka and so on.\nThe Mimamsas do not believe in liberation at all, but rather believe in appeasing the gods through rites in\norder to assure mundane good fortune.\nAdvaita also did not exist by name during the time of the Buddha, but it is refuted for proposing that all\nreality is ultimately one undifferentiated consciousness.\nWhen one reads the sūtras and tantras taught by the Buddha, one can see very clearly that all these\nschools are refuted either directly or indirectly as wrong views.\nWrong view cannot be lead to liberation.\nThere is only one right view, and that is the view of dependent origination.” – Acarya Malcolm Smith, 2017\nJohn Daido Loori, “The Art of Just Sitting: Essential Writings on the Zen Practice of Shikantaza”:\n“To be verified by all things is to let the body and mind of self, and body and mind of others, drop off.”\nDropping off body and mind is a translation of shinjin datsuraku. This is one of the key words in Dogen\nZenji’s teachings. Originally the expression used by Dogen’s teacher [Tendo] Nyojo (Tiantong Rujing). In the\nHokyoki, Dogen Zenji recorded his conversations with Ju-ching while he was practicing at the T’ien-t’ung\n(Tiantong) Monastery. This expression, shinjin datsuraku, was one of the topics Dogen Zenji discussed with\nhis teacher repeatedly.\nNyojo said, “Sanzen is dropping off body and mind. We don’t use incense burning, prostration, nembutsu,\npractice of repentance, reading sutras. We only just sit (shikantaza).”\nDogen asked, “What is dropping off mind and body?” Nyojo said, “Dropping off body and mind is zazen.\nWhen we practice zazen, we part from the five desires and five coverings.” Dogen asked, “if we part from\nthe five desires and get rid of the five coverings, that is the same as the teaching taught in the teaching\nschools. Thus we are the same as the practitioners of Mahayana and Hinayana.”\nNyojo said, “The descendants of the Ancestor (Bodhidharma) should not dislike the teachings taught by\nMahayana and Hinayana. If a practitioner is against the sacred teachings of the Tathagata, how can such a\nperson be the descendant of the buddhas and ancestors?” Dogen asked, “In recent times, some skeptical\npeople say that the three poisonous minds are themselves Buddha Dharma and the five desires are\n1162\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nthemselves the way of the ancestors. If we get rid of them, it is nothing other than like and dislike. Such a\npractice is the same as the Hinayana.”\nNyojo said, “If we don’t get rid of the three poisonous minds and the five desires, we are the same as the\nnon-Buddhists in the country of the King Bimbisara and his son Ajatasattu (at the time of Shakyamuni\nBuddha). For the descendants of buddhas and ancestors, if we get rid of even one covering or one desire,\nthat is the great benefit. That is the time we meet the buddhas and ancestors.”\nNyojo Zenji said that sanzen is dropping off body and mind and dropping off body and mind is zazen. He\nalso said that dropping off body and mind is being free from the five desires and getting rid of the five\ncoverings. The five desires are caused in our mind by contacting the objects of the five sense organs. When\nwe see, hear, smell, taste, and touch some pleasurable objects, we enjoy them, we attach ourselves to them,\nand we want them more and more. Or if the objects are not pleasurable, we dislike them and try to keep\naway from them. But they often come toward us, so we hate them and become angry. Greed and anger\nare caused by the five desires.\nThe five coverings refer to hindrances that cover our mind and prevent it from functioning in a healthy way.\nThose are coverings of greed, anger or hatred, sleepiness or dullness, distraction, and doubt about the\nprinciple of causes and conditions. These five desires and five coverings are discussed originally in the\nDaichidoron (a commentary on Prajnaparamita Sutra by Nagarjuna) as obstacles in meditation practice.\nAnd Tendai Chigi, the great philosopher of the Chinese Tiantai (Tendai) School, mentioned them in the\nmanual of meditation practice, teh Mahashikan (Larger Book of Shamatha and Vipashyana). Chigi said that\na practitioner should part from the five desires and get rid of the five coverings in the meditation practice\ncalled shikan (shamatha and vipashyana). Dogen Zenji was originally ordained as a Tendai monk in Japan\nand was familiar with the teachings and meditation practice in the Tendai tradition. Dogen was not satisfied\nby Tendai practice and began to practice Zen. That was why Dogen asked Nyojo if he should part from the\nfive desires and the five coverings. Until then, Dogen Zenji was looking for something that is different from\nthe teachings he learned in the teaching school. But Nyojo said that our practice of zazen should not be\ndifferent from the Buddha’s teachings recorded in the sutras and systematized in philosophical teaching\nschools. The next conversation on the same topic between Dogen and Nyojo was as follows.\nNyojo said, “The descendants of the buddhas and ancestors should first get rid of the five coverings and\nthen the six coverings. Adding the covering of ignorance to the five coverings make six coverings. Even if a\npractitioner only gets rid of the covering of ignorance, that makes the practitioner free from the five\ncoverings. Even if a practitioner gets rid of the five coverings, if ignorance is not gotten rid of, the\npractitioner has not yet reached the practice of the buddhas and ancestors.”\nDogen immediately made a prostration and expressed gratitude for the teaching. He put his hands in\nshashu position and said, “Until today, I have not heard of such an instruction as that which you have given\nme now, teacher. Elders, experienced teachers, monks and Dharma brothers here do not know at all. They\n1163\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nhave never spoken like this. Today, fortunately, specially I have received your great compassion and have\nheard what I have not heard before. This is fortunate for me, because of the Dharma connection from the\nprevious lives. And yet, is there any secret method to get rid of the five or six coverings?”\nThe teachers smiled and said, “Where have you been putting your whole energy? That is practicing nothing\nother than the Dharma to part from the six coverings. The buddhas and ancestors have not set up any\nclassification in practice. They directly point out and singularly transmit the way of departing from the five\ndesires and six coverings and getting free from the five desires. Making effort in just sitting and dropping\noff body and mind is the method to depart from the five coverings and the five desires. Besides this, there\nis nothing at all. Absolutely, there is nothing else. How can it fall into two or three?”\nThis is Tendo Nyojo Zenji’s explanation of dropping off body and mind. Since Nyojo was the original person\nwho used this expression we should understand it based on Nyojo’s teaching. To drop off body and mind\nis to be free from the six coverings, the three poisonous minds that are the causes of samsara. In just sitting\nzazen, we let go of the three poisonous minds. That is why Dogen Zenji said zazen is not a practice of human\nbeings but the practice of buddhas.\nDogen and Nyojo talked about dropping off body and mind one more time in the Hokyoji, as follows:\nNyojo said:\nThe zazen of arhats and pratyekabuddhas does not have attachment and yet lacks great compassion.\nTherefore it is different from the zazen of buddhas and ancestors in which they put primary importance on\ngreat compassion and the vow to save all living beings. The non-Buddhist practitioners in India also practice\nzazen. And yet, non-Buddhists have three sicknesses. That is, attachment, mistaken views, and arrogance.\nTherefore, their zazen is different from buddhas’ and ancestors’ zazen. Shravakas also practice zazen, and\nyet their compassion is weak. They don’t penetrate the true reality of all beings with wisdom. They try to\nimprove only themselves and cut off the seeds of Buddha. Therefore, their zazen is different from buddhas’\nand ancestors’ zazen. In buddhas’ and ancestors’ zazen, they wish to gather all buddha-dharma from the\ntime they first arouse bodhi-mind. Within zazen, they don’t forget living beings. They offer a compassionate\nheart even to an insect. They vow to save all living beings and they dedicate all merits to all living beings.\nTherefore, buddhas and ancestors practice zazen within the world of desire. Even within the world of desire,\nthey have the best connection with this realm. They practice many virtues generation after generation and\nallow their mind to be flexible.\nDogen made a prostration and said, ‘What do you mean by allowing the mind to be flexible?’\nNyojo said, ‘Affirming buddhas’ and ancestors’ dropping off body and mind is the flexible mind.

There is no such thing as “just accept emotional afflictions as they\nare” in authentic Buddhadharma (although they may be popular notions from new age or neo-Advaita\nteachings). Such a notion is alien to true authentic Buddhism grounded in authentic scriptures but are\nnotions invented by some late teachers (be it Buddhist or non-Buddhist), and such notions lead people in\na 180 degree opposite direction from liberation/Nirvana (cessation), which is clearly defined by Buddha\nhimself as the very ending of passion, aggression and delusion even in this very life.\nIn the bhumi scheme, the first seven bhumis are 'impure bhumis' while the rest are 'pure bhumis' as they\nhave overcome afflictions. Those pure bhumis are similar to arahants in overcoming afflictions through\nfully actualizing the emptiness of self, and the arahat stops there and ends cyclic rebirth, but the next step\naccording to Mahayana scriptures like Lankavatara Sutra etc would be to remove all subtle cognitive\nobscurations through fully actualizing the emptiness of phenomena and overcomes subtle non-samsaric\ntransformation body rebirth.\nWhether you practice path of purification (sutra), path of transformation (tantra) or path of self-liberation\n(dzogchen and mahamudra), as long as you are in a Mahayana path, you will have to go through these two\npurifications eventually.\nArcaya Malcolm, teacher of Dzogchen (see: https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2020/07/dzogchen-\nretreat-with-arcaya-malcolm.html) recently said in his group that maps of awakening in Buddhism are\ngoverned by the elimination of the twin obscurations of affliction and knowledge, and that Dzogchen (Soh:\nwhich, along with Mahamudra, are considered the highest teachings of Tibetan Buddhism) is the same in\nthis respect.\nAlso in dharmawheel he related the Thodgal stages to the bhumi scheme:\n\" According to Khenpo Ngachung, the paths and stages don't really map to Dzogchen, but you can explain\nthings that way:\nVisions 1 & 2, below the path of seeing.\nVision 3; path of seeing and path of cultivation (bhumis 1-7)\nvision 4; end of path of cultivation and path of no more learning (stages 8 to 16).\"\n“There are three traditional methods of dealing with emotions: abandoning them, transforming them, and\nrecognizing their nature. All three levels of Buddhist teaching, all three yanas, describe how to deal with\n1167\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\ndisturbing emotions. It is never taught, on any level, that one can be an enlightened buddha while\nremaining involved in disturbing emotions - never. Each level deals with emotions differently.\n…\nJust like darkness cannot remain when the sun rises, none of the disturbing emotions can endure within\nthe recognition of mind nature. That is the moment of realizing original wakefulness, and it is the same for\neach of the five poisons.\n…\nIn any of the five disturbing emotions, we do not have to transmute the emotion into empty cognizance.\nThe nature of the emotion already is this indivisible empty cognizance.” - Vajra Speech, Tulku Urgyen\nRinpoche\n“Why would you accept afflictive emotions? They are afflictive and are the root cause of suffering.\nEither you renounce them, transform them or self-liberate them. But you certainly don't accept them. That\nway just leads to further rebirth in samsara.\nM” – Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith\n“We do bad things, non-virtuous things, because we are afflicted. Afflictions are never a part of oneself but\nthey do define us as sentient beings. If you want to stop being a sentient being and start being an awakening\nbeing you have to deal with your afflictions via one of three paths I mentioned.\nWhy am I a sentient being and not a Buddha? Because I am subject to afflictions. How do I become a Buddha?\nBy overcoming afflictions and attaining omniscience. How do I begin? By setting out on one of the three\npaths, depending on my capacity.” – Dzogchen teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith\n“Mr. JK said: What you're describing is the duality found in Christianity. saying we are impure and must\nbetter ourselves.\nKyle Dixon replied: Not at all, this is literally the teaching of Dzogchen, Śrī Siṃha one of the original\nDzogchen masters, who was Padmasambhava’s guru, states:\nThis is acceptable since a so called “primordial buddhahood” is not asserted. Full awakening is not\npossible without being free of the five afflictions... It is not possible for wisdom to increase without\ngiving up afflictions. Wisdom will not arise without purifying afflictions. (Bolded and emphasized by\nSoh)\n1168\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nLikewise, Khenpo Ngachung, one of the greatest luminaries of recent times states:\nIn any system of sutra or tantra, without gathering the accumulations and purifying obscurations, Buddhahood\ncan never be attained. Though the system of gathering accumulations and purifying obscurations is different, in\nthis respect [dzogchen] is the same.\nLongchenpa states:\nAll phenomena of samsara depend on the mind, so when the essence (ngo bo) of mind is purified, samsara is\npurified... The essence of mind is an obscuration to be given up. The essence of vidyā is pristine consciousness\n(ye shes) to be attained... That being so, it is very important to differentiate mind and pristine consciousness\nbecause all meditation is just that: all methods of purifying vāyu and vidyā are that; and in the end at the time\nof liberation, vidyā is purified of all obscurations because it is purified of the mind.\nEven Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, Mingyur Rinpoche’s father, states:\nPurification happens through training on the path. We have strayed from the basis and become sentient beings.\nTo free the basis from what obscures it, we have to train. Right now, we are on the path and have not yet\nattained the result. When we are freed from obscuration, then the result - dharmakāya - appears... the qualities\nof the result are contained in the state of the basis; yet, they are not evident or manifest. That is the difference\nbetween the basis and the result. At the time of the path, if we do not apply effort, the result will not appear.\nThus there is still much for you to understand about how Dzogchen actually works. You are only speaking\nof the side of the nature, the state of Dzogchen, but the side of appearances, the side of the practitioner,\nis not pure and perfect just yet. The two sides meet when the practitioner recognizes that nature, which is\nnot presently known, and trains in the method and view.\n5” – Kyle Dixon, 2021, krodha (u/krodha) - Reddit\n“Mipham:\n\"All of the faults of samsara arise from the deluded mind which apprehends a personal self or a self of\nphenomena. Since this deluded mind also is adventitious like clouds in the sky, from the beginning\nneither mixing nor polluting the luminous clarity of the primordial basic nature, these faults are separate\nfrom the basic element and suitable to be removed. Therefore, the essence of the basic element is empty\nof these faults; it is untainted. Without depending on the polluting delusion, the basic element is\nluminous and clear by its own nature; self-existing wisdom permeates the thusness197 of all phenomena.\nIt is not empty of that which it is inseparable from, the basic element of consummate qualities, because in\nits essence, this is the basic nature from which it is inseparable—like the sun and its rays of light.\nIn this way, the naturally abiding heritage is established as the unconditioned essence of the Truth Body,\nwhich is primordially endowed with qualities. Due to the potential to be a buddha, the Wisdom Truth\nBody, without decrease or increase, necessarily resides in the mind-streams of all sentient beings,\nbecause in training on the path, the potential to be a buddha is established by the power of fact. Also,\nsince the Truth Body at the time of being a buddha is unconditioned—it is not possible for it to be a\n1169\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\nconditioned phenomenon that is newly formed by causes and conditions—it is established that “it\npresently resides as the essence of the buddha.”\nRegarding this, some people think, “If it presently resides as the essence of the buddha, why does that\nomniscient wisdom not dispel the obscurations of these sentient beings?” Or fixating upon the range of\nmeanings of the common vehicle, they think, “Since the buddha is the effect and sentient beings are the\ncause, the effect being present in the cause is invalidated by reason, using such reasoning as the eating of\nfood would [absurdly entail] the eating of excrement.”\nFor you who have been guided by merely a limited understanding of the common scriptures and have not\ntrained in the meaning of the extremely profound, definitive meaning sutras, it is no wonder that such\nqualms have arisen! These [objections of yours], however, are not the case. Why? Although the suchness\nthat is luminous and clear wisdom is present in everything without distinction, when adventitious\ndelusion arises in one’s mind, the basis of designation of samsara is only this deluded mind together with\nits object; due to this delusion, one’s suchness is not known as it is. For example, when sleeping, due to\nthe power of mental consciousness alone, unrestricted appearances arise such as the body, objects, and\neye-consciousness, and so forth. At that time, although the subject and object are observed and\napprehended separately, the mental consciousness itself is not able to know its own mode of being, in\nwhich the perceived [object] and the perceiving [subject] are not established as different; even though it\nis not known, there is nothing other than this mode of being. Likewise, all phenomena abide as\nemptiness; even so, merely being like this does not entail that everyone realizes this, because there is the\npossibility of delusion—appearances that do not accord with reality.\nTherefore, since mind and the wisdom of the essential nature are [respectively] phenomenon and\nsuchness, sentient beings and the Buddha are taught in terms of the mode of appearance and the mode\nof reality. Thus, using the reason that the effect is present in the cause to invalidate this position is simply\nnot understanding it. In this way, this reasoning is that the evidence of a clear manifestation of the Truth\nBody at the time of the fruition establishes that the heritage, primordially endowed with qualities, is\npresent at the time of the cause because there is no temporal causality in the mode of reality;\nnevertheless, in dependence upon the mode of appearance, it is necessarily posited as cause and effect.\n—LION’S ROAR: EXPOSITION ON BUDDHA-NATURE, 575–79\nDuckworth, Douglas; Mipam, Jamgon.

However due to latent obscurations that awakened equipoise will be unstable and our prajñā\nwill be fragmented. The more we access awakened equipoise however, the more karma in the form of kleśa\nand vāsanā will be burned away, and as a result, the more obscurations will be removed and diminished.\nThe path is precisely eliminating those obscurations, the afflictive obscuration that conceives of a self and\nthe cognitive obscuration that conceives of external objects. Buddhas have completely eliminated these\ntwo obscurations and as a result their samādhi is samati, a transcendent state of awakened equipoise\nbeyond the three times.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\n“No. Every liberated person has realized the absence of self, i.e., emptiness, and in so doing, has ceased\nbeing under control of afflictions.

Mahamati, what doesn’t differ is the taste of liberation when shravakas and\npratyeka-buddhas or buddhas and tathagatas get rid of the obstruction of passion, not when they get rid\nof the obstruction of knowledge. Mahamati, the obstruction of knowledge is purified when they see that\ndharmas have no self. The obstruction of passion is removed prior to this when they become accustomed\nto seeing that persons have no self. It is when the seventh consciousness ceases that they are liberated\nfrom the obstruction of dharmas. And it is when the habit-energy of the repository consciousness ceases\nthat their purification is complete.”\nMahayana/Vajrayana teachers such as Arcaya Malcolm and others, as well as texts also indicate that the\nArhats lack the realization of twofold emptiness and emptiness free from extremes. They treat\naggregates, sense faculties and so on as substantially real, although they have realised anatman.\nIn other words, arahats purify the ‘obscuration of passion’ through ‘seeing that persons have no self’ while\nthe Buddha further purifies all remaining ‘obscuration of knowledge’ through ‘seeing that dharmas have\nno self’. Of course, there are a lot of subtleties and depth in insight and actualization between a stream\nentrant, 1st bhumi, an arahant, a Buddha, and anything in between.\n*https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Cognitive_obscurations\nTwo obscurations (Tib. སབི ་པ་གཉིས་, dribpa nyi; Wyl. sgrib pa gnyis) — emotional and cognitive obscurations.\n● Emotional obscurations are defined according to their essence, cause and function.\nIn essence, they are the opposite of the six paramitas, as described in the Gyü Lama:\n\"Thoughts such as avarice and so on,\nThese are the emotional obscurations.\"\nTheir cause is grasping at a personal ego, or the “self of the individual”.\nThey function to prevent liberation from samsara.\n1175\nOvercoming the Emotional Afflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas)\n● Cognitive obscurations are also defined according to their essence, cause and function.\nIn essence, they are thoughts that involve the three conceptual ‘spheres’ of subject, object and action. The\nGyü Lama says:\n\"Thoughts that involve the three spheres,\nThese are the cognitive obscurations.\"\nTheir cause is grasping at phenomena as truly existent, or, in other words, the “self of phenomena”.\nTheir function is to prevent complete enlightenment.\n“Clearing intellectual obscurity actually requires quite some shamata concentration that enables the mind\nto see clearly experience and how the conceptual mind process in a slow motion. It is like anatta but\nmore complex issues are seen clearly in real time.\n...\nOne can be free from subject and object division in experience, but one may not be free from mind-\nmatter duality. There is intellectual mind/matter duality block despite experience being non-dual and\nanatta. Freedom from duality in experience does not mean you are free from mind/matter duality and\nthe relationship between them.” – John Tan, 2020\n“Now having non-dual experience or a state of no-mind does not mean finality. We must also free\nourselves from many more intellectual obscurations. other obscurations of cause. Like having non-dual\nor no-mind may not free on from the notion of self. Freeing one from the notion of self, may not free one\nfrom the notion of cause. Freeing one from the notion of cause, may not free one from the notion of\nexistence. Freeing one from duality, may not free one from non-duality. The color you see is neither\ninside, nor outside. It is inside, it is also outside. It is private, it is also public.\nSo it is neither too.” – John Tan, 2020\n“Before anyone can hope to overcome emotional and mental afflictions or knowledge obscurations, they\nmust have given rise to all the insights in Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment , but this is\nnot the end, they must cultivate meditative equipoise and samadhi conjoined with insight and then tune\nthem up ever more until all traces of mental afflictions/kleshas/defilements are burned off in the light of\nprajna forever. See Buddha's teachings on this in https://becoming-buddha.com/yuganaddha-sutta-\ntranquility.../\nAdditionally, one must overcome the knowledge or cognitive obscurations that prevent omniscience or\nBuddhahood. The wisdom of twofold emptiness must be refined and deepened to the degree that all\ntraces of reifying phenomena, not only in terms of ‘subject’, ‘object’ and ‘action’, but also in terms of\narising, abiding and ceasing, in terms of cause and effect, characteristics of phenomena, internality and\nexternality, existence and non-existence of phenomena, and so on. Knowledge obscuration is overcome\n1176\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nby the wisdom of the emptiness of all phenomena.\nThe realization of twofold emptiness marks the entry into the path of seeing, the first bhumi stage of\nBodhisattva path, but it is not the end -- Buddhahood, also known as the 11th, or 13th, or 16th bhumi\ndepending on the map. It is said that Arahants and 8th Bhumi bodhisattvas have overcome all traces of\nemotional afflictions, while a Buddha has additionally overcome all traces of knowledge obscuration. The\ngoal of AtR people here is generally Buddhahood (maybe some may opt for Arahantship depending on\nthe tradition they practice - anyone is entitled to their own choice or preference for the spiritual path they\nundertake)” – Soh, Buddhahood: The End of All Emotional/Mental Afflictions and Knowledge Obscurations\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nCompassion is vital to one’s practice and progression.

If emotion isn't part of the mind's nature, do positive emotions such\nas joy and happiness need to be abandoned along with the kleshas if one wants to achieve a pure mind?\nIf you practice effectively and begin to have instances of awakened, nonconceptual equipoise of a yogic\ndirect perception of emptiness, then you will encounter what is called prajñā, which is the transcendent\nand ecstatic knowledge of emptiness that occurs while in awakened equipoise. Prajñā is forceful and\nbright and actually involuntarily “burns” away kelśas just by virtue of its nature. As such, if you cultivate\nawakened equipoise, then each time you establish a samādhi infused with prajñā, more and more kleśas\nwill be exhausted, and with them, the seeds for afflictive states of mind and negative emotions.\n1177\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nYou will still be able to have positive emotions, but overall you will actually end up establishing a state of\nequanimity where you will be pretty even all the time, content and undisturbed.\nWith that your compassion will naturally increase, because compassion is actually an innate property of\nthe nature of mind.\nThe prajñā or “wisdom” of suchness/emptiness that knows the actual nature of phenomena, manifests\nonce the knowledge obscuration that misconceives of an inherent identity or \"self\" in phenomena is\nexhausted as a result of authentic awakening. The direct realization of an absence of self in persons and\nphenomena is then the basis of compassion, as noted in the Sangs rgyas gsang ba'i lam rim:\nBeing empty, it is always devoid of attributes, and free from the clinging to the notion of self. Therefore, the\nsuchness upon seeing this forms the basis for the arising of compassion.\nPadampa Sangye concurs:\nWhen you realize emptiness, it would be absurd to do anything negative. When you realize emptiness,\ncompassion arises with it simultaneously.\n5\n4\nkrodha\n· 1d\nSo you’re saying that compassion IS part of mind’s pure nature and is not a coloring “hue” like emotions\nmight be, according to the Dalai Lama’s framework, correct?\nYes, compassion is considered to be an innate aspect of the nature of mind, and altruistic in that the\naspect of karuna or compassion actually works for the benefit of other beings by virtue of its very nature.\nIn some teachings it says that this compassion selflessly performs virtuous and altruistic deeds on behalf\nof beings.\nIs the idea that the pure nature of the mind is inherently virtuous/beneficial?\nYes. We are kind and compassionate by nature. The less compassionate amongst us just have a bit more\ndust on their mirrors, so to speak.\nFrom Ācārya Malcolm:\nIn Dzogchen, there is little need to 'cultivate' compassion since compassion is recognized a) to be innate b) will\nbe expanded up by recognizing your own state.\n...We all have compassion. So the way to increase it is to simply see that we have it, and exercise that muscle a\nbit more.\nThen, when we recognize our true condition, our compassion will burst out like the sun behind a cloud.\n1178\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\n2” – Krodha (Kyle Dixon) -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/p15r8z/question_on_emotions_and_the_pure_nature_of_\nthe/\n\"Hara's great.

The more we experience our radiance clarity, the\nmore difficult for us to let go. This I understand. Maybe we should channel some bits of our time and\nenergy towards understanding the relationship between compassion and emptiness.\nWhen watching Garchen Rinpoche movie that Piotr sent me, it seems that to Garchen Rinpoche,\nnothing matters more than sentient beings. Whether there “is or isn’t” an essence seems to be a non-\nissue; if there is, he would joyfully and generously sacrifice for the benefits of sentient beings when\nneeded. This is what I gathered from the movie.\nI am beginning to see why Nagarjuna asserted that emptiness is the womb of compassion.\nI am beginning to understand without the awakening of Bodhichitta, there is no true realization of\nemptiness.\nI am beginning to see why Bodhicitta and wisdom are the causes of Buddhahood.\nMay Bodhicitta be awakened in our authentic mindstreams.\nHomage to Bodhicitta.” - John Tan, 2013\n(Note: “Bodhicitta is a spontaneous wish to attain enlightenment motivated by great compassion for all\nsentient beings, accompanied by a falling away of the attachment to the illusion of an inherently existing\nself.” - Wikipedia)\n“Bodhicitta is your acting, your thinking, your selfless thinking for others,” says Tsoknyi Rinpoche.\n“When you don’t have any solid self that you need to maintain, and all your energy is used to fulfill others’\nhappiness. That kind of attitude – or action of mind – is called bodhicitta.\n1181\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nAs His Holiness the Dalai Lama always says, promote human values: love, compassion, tolerance. We have\nhuman intelligence. Use that intelligence inside as well, not always outside. Make it happy and healthy. And\nthen within that intelligence, then you operate or connect with the outside world.\nHis Holiness is really addressing the love and compassion and clarity of human beings. Based on love and\ncompassion – it doesn’t matter what kind of tradition or religion – it’s really about authentic beings. When\nwe can see that, it’s very reassuring to know that the world is good, it’s in good shape.” - Tsoknyi Rinpoche,\n‘Open Heart, Open Mind’\nIt should however be understood that the traditional term, relative Bodhicitta in Mahayana and Vajrayana\nBuddhism also implies the aspiration and intention to attain Buddhahood (full awakening) for the benefit\nof all sentient beings, and is not merely the practice of compassion. Ultimate Bodhicitta is the insight into\nemptiness. Both are indispensable components on the path to full awakening (Buddhahood).\nDzogchen teacher Archaya Malcolm Smith: “Knowledge is not a hindrance. Ignorance is.\nFirst, one generates bodhicitta, the desire to liberate all sentient beings from samsara. This has two aspects,\nultimate and relative. The relative aspect refers to the aspiration, and then practicing the six perfections.\nUltimate bodhicitta means practicing śamatha and vipaśyanā.\nOne practices these two bodhicitta together, until one realizes emptiness. This is the first bodhisattva\nbhumi. One continues to practice, until the practice of vipaśyanā has eradicated all traces of affliction\n(desire, hatred, and ignorance). This happens conventionally, at the seventh bhumi. Ultimately, has\neradicated all traces of grasping to personal and phenomena identity, and one attains the omniscience of\nbuddhahood, this happens when one transitions from being a tenth stage bodhisattva to buddhahood. A\nbuddha is a totally realized person. There is no other kind of totally or fully realized person.”\nVen. Huifeng: “An excellent example of what is meant by bodhicitta is to be found in the Vajracchedika\nPrajnaparamita Sutra (aka: the Diamond Sutra). Conze's translation has:\n1182\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nThe Lord said: Here, Subhuti, someone who has set out in the vehicle of a Bodhisattva should produce a thought\nin this manner: 'As many beings as there are in the universe of beings, comprehended under the term \"beings\"\negg-born, born from a womb, moisture-born, or miraculously born; with or without form; with perception, without\nperception, and with neither perception nor non-perception, as far as any conceivable form of beings is conceived:\nall these I must lead to Nirvana, into that Realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. And yet, although\ninnumerable beings have thus been led to Nirvana, no being at all has been led to Nirvana.' And why? If in a\nBodhisattva the notion of a 'being' should take place, he could not be called a 'Bodhi-being'. 'And why? He is not\nto be called a Bodhi-being, in whom the notion of a self or of a being should take place, or the notion of a living\nsoul or of a person.'\nIt involves the compassion to lead beings to nirvana, and also the wisdom of emptiness that sees that\nultimately there is no \"living being\".”\n“John Tan: selfless compassion is further dimension of anatta. After anatta, practitioner must learn how to\nradiate the energy outward. But sometimes it may not be revealed. It also needs time to open up till a\ncertain turning point. Then we can turn our perception that direction and emanate out compassionate\nenergy. Need certain 缘 (conditions).” - John Tan, 2018\n“Yesterday I experienced the same energy release as the time I watched Garchen Rinpoche. Genuine\ncompassion is not only towards others but also releases karmic bond.” - John Tan, 2018\n“After you have glimpses into two fold [emptiness], start to look into compassion. Take small steps at a time\nand start to understand what compassion mean… like practicing anatta and emptiness.\n…\nYou must have enough rest, stabilize two-fold [emptiness] and develop step by step your compassion and\nsense of reverence towards things. It will bring you to new height. I am having zero concern of anatta and\n1183\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\n2 fold… it is so natural and relaxed with added new source of joyful energy, don’t know from where. Like a\nbrilliance ball of light radiating with joyous flow of energy.\n…\nIf self-sprung appearance is natural [state] and [is] liberating but lack a reverence and compassionate heart,\nthen you must practice metta.” - John Tan, 2014\n“Anyway, the Prasangika approach talks a lot about compassion for several reasons. 1. Practicing\ncompassion even in small ways like metta, as well as combining it with emptiness meditations opens the\nheart, and softens up the false conception of the inherent self. 2. Practicing compassion in all ways helps\ntransform our motivation to help free all sentient beings from suffering. This can supercharge our\nmotivation to study emptiness. Emptiness is not easy, especially in the very subtle stages approaching\nnonconceptuality. 3. When you realize the emptiness of the person (even just intellectually), your\ncompassion grows by leaps and bounds. When you realize emptiness nonconceptually and globally,\ncompassion becomes an unbounded unconditional love. In this particular emptiness approach (there are\nothers), one needs three kinds of meditation to realize emptiness nonconceptually. (1) Compassion\nmeditation, (2) Emptiness meditation, (3) Shamata.” - Greg Goode, 2014\nMetta Sutta:\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp1_8.html\nThis is to be done by one skilled in aims\nappreciating the state of peace:\nBe capable, upright, & straightforward,\neasy to instruct, gentle, & not conceited,\ncontent & easy to support,\nwith few duties, living lightly,\n1184\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nwith peaceful faculties, astute,\nmodest, & no greed for supporters.\nDo not do the slightest thing\nthat the observant would later censure.\nThink: Happy, at rest,\nmay all beings be happy at heart.\nWhatever beings there may be,\nweak or strong, without exception,\nlong, large,\nmiddling, short,\nsubtle, gross,\nseen & unseen,\nliving near & far away,\nborn or seeking birth:\nMay all beings be happy at heart.\nLet no one deceive another\nor despise anyone anywhere,\nor, through anger or resistance-perception,\nwish for another to suffer.\n1185\nCompassion and Loving-Kindness\nAs a mother would risk her life\nto protect her child, her only child,\neven so should one cultivate the heart limitlessly\nwith regard to all beings.1\nWith goodwill for the entire cosmos,\ncultivate the heart limitlessly:\nabove, below, & all around,\nunobstructed, without hostility or hate.\nWhether standing, walking,\nsitting, or lying down,\nas long as one has banished torpor,\none should be resolved on this mindfulness.2\nThis is called a Brahmā abiding\nhere.\nNot taken with views,\nbut virtuous & consummate in vision,\nhaving subdued greed for sensuality,\none never again\nwill lie in the womb.\n1186\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nvv. 143–152\nNotes\n1.

As one overcomes the afflictions and obscurations, one’s actions becomes\nnaturally more altruistically motivated, even though awakening to the realization of no-self should not be\nmistaken as merely a state of altruism (it is the realisation of the nature of mind/reality).

As a result of that marriage, seven sons were born to them and in course of\ntime, all the sons got married. One day, the Buddha surveyed the world early in the morning with his\nsupernormal power and found that the hunter, his seven sons and their wives were due for attainment of\nSotapatti Fruition. So, the Buddha went to the place where the hunter had set his trap in the forest. He\nput his footprint close to the trap and seated himself under the shade of a bush, not far from the trap.\nWhen the hunter came, he saw no animal in the trap; he saw the footprint and surmised that someone\nmust have come before him and let cut the animal. So, when he saw the Buddha under the shade of the\nbush, he took him for the man who had freed the animal from his trap and flew into a rage. He took out\nhis bow and arrow to shoot at the Buddha, but as he drew his bow, he became immobilized and\nremained fixed in that position like a statue. His sons followed and found their father; they also saw the\nBuddha at some distance and thought he must be the enemy of their father. All of them took out their\nbows and arrows to shoot at the Buddha, but they also became immobilized and remained fixed in their\nrespective postures. When the hunter and his sons failed to return, the hunter's wife followed them into\nthe forest, with her seven daughters-in-law. Seeing her husband and all her sons with their arrows aimed\nat the Buddha, she raised both her hands and shout: \"Do not kill my father.\"\nWhen her husband heard her words, he thought, \"This must be my father-in-law\", and her sons thought,\n\"This must be our grandfather\"; and thoughts of loving-kindness came into them. Then the lady said to\nthem, ''Put away your bows and arrows and pay obeisance to my father\". The Buddha realized that, by\nthis time, the minds of the hunter and his son; had softened and so he willed that they should be able to\nmove and to put away their bows and arrows. After putting away their bows and arrows, they paid\nobeisance to the Buddha and the Buddha expounded the Dhamma to them. In the end, the hunter, his\nseven sons and seven daughters-in-law, all fifteen of them, attained Sotapatti Fruition.\n1190\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nThen the Buddha returned to the monastery and told Thera Ananda and other bhikkhus about the hunter\nKukkutamitta and his family attaining Sotapatti Fruition in the early part of the morning. The bhikkhus\nthen asked the Buddha, \"Venerable Sir, is the wife of the hunter who is a sotapanna, also not guilty of\ntaking life, if she has been getting things like nets, bows and arrows for her husband when he goes out\nhunting?\" To this question the Buddha answered, \"Bhikkhus, the sotapannas do not kill, they do not wish\nothers to get killed. The wife of the hunter was only obeying her husband in getting things for him. Just as\nthe hand that has no wound is not affected by poison, so also, because she has no intention to do evil she\nis not doing any evil.\"\nThen the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:\nVerse 124: If there is no wound on the hand, one may handle poison; poison does not affect one who has\nno wound; there can be no evil for one who has no evil intention.”\nThere is a quote by Padmasambhava that John Tan liked very much:\n“While my view is as high as the sky, my actions regarding cause and effect [karma] are as meticulous as\nfinely ground barley flour” - Padmasambhava\n“Padmasambhava said: ‘Though the view should be as vast as the sky, keep your conduct as fine as barley\nflour.’ Don’t confuse one with the other. When training in the view, you can be as unbiased, as impartial, as\nvast, immense, and unlimited as the sky. Your behaviour, on the other hand, should be as careful as\npossible in discriminating what is beneficial or harmful, what is good or evil. One can combine the view and\nconduct, but don’t mix them or lose one in the other. That is very important.\n‘View like the sky’ means that nothing is held onto in any way whatsoever. You are not stuck anywhere at\nall. In other words, there is no discrimination as to what to accept and what to reject; no line is drawn\nseparating one thing from another. ‘Conduct as fine as barley flour’ means that there is good and evil, and\none needs to differentiate between the two. Give up negative deeds; practice the Dharma. In your\nbehaviour, in your conduct, it is necessary to accept and reject.” ~Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche\n“Many new-age philosophers speak about a carefree life. But, without seeing the concordance between the\ntwo – of spaciousness and meticulousness – they fall into nihilism. They preach the high view of going\nbeyond acceptance and rejection. Yet, lacking in skillful methods to ascend from below, and remaining\nindifferent to causality, they go astray. They slip into an utterly careless life of turmoil. In contrast, when a\ncarefree view is practiced along with a careful conduct, the yogi realizes all experiences to be in one taste,\nthat of great bliss.\nYet others, seeing the faults of careless life, tightly grasp on to the conduct. Though they remain virtuous\nand avoid harm, their virtuosity does not transcend the mundane. Clinging tightly to the cause and effect\nview, they do not see the liberating expanse. While they have the strength to ascend with the conduct, they\nlack the panoramic vision of descending with the view.”\n1191\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\n- Yogi Prabodha Jnana\n\"Don't fall into wild fox zen (野狐禅). Conventional conduct and precepts equally important, otherwise [one\nends up] like the koan of fox zen rebirthing 500 lives as a fox. 😆\" - John Tan to Mr. LW, 2020\n“[2/6/22, 12:27:46 AM] John Tan: As for Mr. A and Yin Ling conversations,:\nNo, for all practice purposes from top to bottom, karma is unerring and unfailing in all schools for both\ngelug or non-gelug, whether Tibetan or Chinese buddhism.\nEven in direct path traditions, zen for example, we have the famous Baizhang fox koan that a mistake of\nsaying not subject to karma led to 500 lives reborn as a fox. In mahamudra we have Milarepa undergoing\ntremendous hardship due to immense negative karma. In dzogchen we have Longchenpa warning against\nthat too in his poem resting in mind's nature:\n44. “The law of karmic cause and fruit, Compassion and the gathering of merit —\nAll this is but provisional teaching fit for children:\nEnlightenment will not be gained thereby.\nGreat yogis should remain without intentioned action.\nThey should meditate upon reality that is like space.\nSuch is the definitive instruction.”\nThe view of those who speak like this Is of all views the most nihilist: They have embraced the lowest of all\npaths. How strange this is! They want a fruit but have annulled its cause.\n46.\nThe true, authentic path asserts\nThe arising in dependence of both cause and fruit,\nThe natural union of skillful means and wisdom.\nThrough the causality of nonexistent but appearing acts,\n1192\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nThrough meditation on the nonexistent but appearing path,\nThe fruit is gained, appearing and yet nonexistent;\nAnd for the sake of nonexistent but appearing beings,\nEnlightened acts, appearing and yet nonexistent, manifest.\nSuch is pure causality’s profound interdependence.\nThis is the essential pith\nOf all the sūtra texts whose meaning is definitive\nAnd indeed of all the tantras.\nThrough the joining of the two accumulations,\nThe generation and perfection stages,\nPerfect buddhahood is swiftly gained.\n[2/6/22, 12:37:19 AM] John Tan: If Padmasambhava that can cast hand and foot prints on the rocks also\ntake karma seriously, we just have to know and take it seriously that karma as action of body, speech and\nmind have consequent and bear fruit.\n[2/6/22, 12:37:52 AM] Soh Wei Yu: oic..\n[2/6/22, 1:17:04 AM] Soh Wei Yu: image omitted\n[2/6/22, 9:34:41 AM] John Tan: Verse 44 already stated it clear.

Don't be hindered by whatsoever, even most profound teachings must be dropped. Fully\nopen up, fully empty, fully engaged. If ur lzls or anyone asked in ur temple about the nature of one's mind,\nhow can you be immobilized if insights are genuine and authentic? Mind's nature cannot be found in\ntextbook nor in scriptures; in a moment of right condition, a chirping bird can also open one's wisdom eye.\nThat is what you lack most now and a good training ground for u.”\n\"Bodhidharma’s Bloodstream Sermon\n- taken from The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma translated by Red Pine (1987)\nBodhidharma (440-528)\nEverything that appears in the three realms leads back to the mind. Hence, buddhas of the past and\nfuture teach mind to mind without bothering about definitions.\nBut if they don't define it, what do they mean by mind? You ask.\nThat's your mind. I answer. That's my mind. If I had no mind, how could I answer? If you had no mind,\nhow could you ask? That which asks is your mind. Through endless kalpas without beginning, whatever\nyou do, wherever you are, that's your real mind, that's your real buddha.\nThis mind is the buddha says the same thing. Beyond this mind you'll never find another buddha. To\nsearch for enlightenment or nirvana beyond this mind is impossible. The reality of your own self-nature,\nthe absence of cause and effect, is what's meant by mind. Your mind is nirvana. You might think you can\nfind a buddha or enlightenment somewhere beyond the mind, but such a place doesn't exist.\n1194\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nTrying to find a buddha or enlightenment is like trying to grab space. Space has a name but no form. It's\nnot something you can pick up or put down. And you certainly can't grab it. Beyond this mind you'll never\nsee a buddha. The buddha is a product of your mind. Why look for a buddha beyond this mind?\nBuddhas of the past and future only talk about this mind. The mind is the buddha. And the buddha is the\nmind. Beyond the mind there's no buddha. And beyond the buddha there's no mind. If you think there's a\nbuddha beyond the mind, where is he? There's no buddha beyond the mind, so why envision one? You\ncan't know your real mind as long as you deceive yourself. As long as you're enthralled by a lifeless form,\nyou're not free. If you don't believe me, deceiving yourself doesn't help. It's not the buddha's fault.\nPeople, though, are deluded. They're unaware that their own mind is the buddha. Otherwise, they\nwouldn't look for a buddha outside the mind.\nBuddhas don't save buddhas. If you use your mind to look for a buddha, you won't see the buddha. As\nlong as you look for a buddha somewhere else, you'll never see that your own mind is the buddha. And\ndon't use a buddha to worship a buddha. And don't use the mind to invoke a buddha. Buddhas don't\nrecite sutras. Buddhas don't keep precepts. And buddhas don't break precepts. Buddhas don't keep or\nbreak anything. Buddhas don't do good or evil.\nTo find a buddha, you have to see your nature. Whoever sees his or her nature is a buddha. If you don't\nsee your nature, invoking buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings and keeping precepts are all useless.\nInvoking buddhas results in good karma. Reciting sutras results in good memory. Keeping precepts\nresults in a good rebirth. And making offerings results in future blessings. But no buddha.\nLong ago, the monk Good Star was able to recite the entire Canon. But he didn't escape the Wheel\nbecause he didn't see his nature. If this was the case for Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a\nfew sutras or shastras and think it's the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, reciting so much\nprose is useless.\nTo find a buddha, all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the buddha. And the buddha is the\nperson who's free, free of plans, free of cares. If you don't see your nature and run around all day looking\nsomewhere else, you'll never find a buddha. The truth is there's nothing to find. Life and death are\nimportant. Don't suffer them in vain. There's no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have\nmountains of jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the Ganges, you see them\nwhen your eyes are open. But what about when your eyes are shut? You should realize that everything\nyou see is like a dream or illusion.\nBuddha is Sanskrit for what you call aware, miraculously aware. Responding, perceiving, arching your\nbrows, blinking your eyes, moving your hands and feet, it's all your miraculously aware nature. And this\nnature is the mind. And the mind is the buddha. And the buddha is the path. And the path is zen. But the\n1195\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nword zen is one that remains a puzzle to both mortals and sages. Seeing your nature is zen. Unless you\nsee your nature, it's not zen.\nBodhidharma (440-528)\nExcerpted from The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma translated by Red Pine (1987)\"\n“Even though you have realized that your mind is the Buddha, don’t forsake your master!

Feel free to fill in any gaps and comment on any\noversights, pretty pls.\n***\nAs a householder the relative plane is important and should not be neglected. Like a video game\ncharacter that is seen as empty with progressively deepening understanding, it is a good idea to make the\ncharacter a good one. Looking after our families, adopting responsibility, contributing to our community\nect.\nAdditionally, upgrading the character also tends to result in more positive emotion as one is engaged with\nthe world. Sila in Buddhism per say. This assists the process of awakening as Samadhi/unification of mind\nis more available to assist inquiry practice because the soil for insight is more fertile.\nThere is a shadow to this of course. We run the risk of re-ifying the small self. 'I'm getting better!' - but\nwhom is getting better? We may also overwork and overlook what is already here. Self improving in order\nto acquire an external source of happiness. Like a carrot on a stick leading us from one goal to the next,\nwe might yearn for external achievement while failing to inquire whom is actually holding the stick in the\nfirst place and see freedom is already apparent (thanks Angello DiLullo for this analogy). Perhaps\nsubconsciously seeking status, for example. This reification might work in very subtle ways causing\nsignificant suffering until awakening is fully realized and everything is consistently seen as IT.\nThe process of realization makes these subtle reifications of self clearer to see. Unskillful motives(perhaps\nthrough wounding/cultural drives/beliefs) toward leveling up the character are seen as thoughts, are\nilluminated and seen to be empty. Frequently inquiring toward ones motivates in active reflection and\ninquiring even beyond this may help tremendously here.\nCurious what ATR thinks/has anything to add!\n1197\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\nThe spiritual path is all about totally obliterating all delusions and sense of self/Self and later the subtle\nknowledge obscurations. For that you need to realise, and if you haven't realise then take steps to\nrealisation, then after realisation there is usually still ongoing practice and two obscurations that are\ngradually eliminated. Anything that supports that path or at least does not detract one from that, will be\nsupportive. Examples of actions that would not be supportive would be the ten nonvirtues*, or any acts\nthat harms oneself and/or others, disturbs the mind, causes guilt and other unwholesome mental factors\nwhich can obscure the clarity and stability of one's mind. The ten unwholesome or nonvirtuous actions\nthemselves arise out of afflictions and self-grasping.\nNone of those actions you mentioned, in and of themselves, are necessities nor hindrances for\nawakening but are individual specific. Nobody can tell you what you must do, it must come from one's\nown intuitive awareness. For example taking responsibility for family - what about monks? Monks don't\nneed to take responsibility for family (other than perhaps in some ways like teaching dharma and so on),\nbut many monks are awakened. But as a lay person if you have a family, then taking responsibility for\nfamily is also not in and of itself an obstacle, but what is appropriate for you. Engagement in activity is not\nnecessarily an obstacle, in fact, when one is actualizing anatta, one is fully engaged in a non-dual manner,\nfrom sound and sight and smell and taste and touch and thought... to full engagement in action where\nthe whole universe is exerting in that action/activity. One is only not engaged in the moment of action if\nthere is a sense of self, dissociating, withdrawing, contracting away from the moment of experience or\naction. Dissociation is the result of sense of self and grasping, thus a cause of suffering. But at the same\ntime if one is attached or grasping while engaging, then one is appropriating things in terms of I, me, and\nmine, then it becomes an obstacle and a cause for suffering as well. So, the key and quality of spiritual\npractices does not always lie in 'what' you are doing/not-doing, but more in terms of the quality of how\nyou are relating or experiencing that moment, and more fundamentally whether one is operating from\nignorance or wisdom/gnosis.\nThere is also the teaching of non-action, wu wei, or wei wu wei -- actionless action. In actionless action,\nthe gap between actor and action is refined till none. As John Tan puts it in 2012, \"When the gap between\nactor and action is refined till none, that is non-action and that non-action is total action. Whether this\ntotal action is understood as the natural way will depend on whether the insight of anatta has arisen.\nAnatta is the insight that allows the practitioner to see clearly that this has always been the case.\" -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/.../total-exertion_20.html\nBesides the refining the gap of actor and action till none, there are also the qualities of 'action without\nseeking results', behaving without hopes and fears. Almost like you are doing something for the sake of\njust doing something, rather than a result in the future. There can moments of planning, a goal, but in\nthat moment of executing there is no attachment to all these, just pure action. And one is not attached to\nan expected result or outcome either. The means becomes an end to itself. As John Tan said, in his\nbusiness career, he had to deal with a lot of these, and the key is completely relinquishing all grasping at\n'gain' and 'loss' into non-action. This is also a key to non-action and liberation. The relinquishment of\n1198\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\ngrasping towards the eight worldly winds: Gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, & pain\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN8_6.html\nNow I speak as if spirituality is only totally 'self immolating' or 'self relinquishment' as if it is a complete\nopposite of 'self improvement'. That is also not necessarily the case. Improvement is always happening\nand is usually something positive, but while actualizing it comes from the flow of the total exertion. Like\nyou learn and become good at singing by the full engagement of singing, you learn and become good at\ntennis by the full engagement of playing tennis. The learning does not come from a 'self' trying to 'know'\nor 'grasp' or 'learn' or 'become better' at something. Simply let the full engagement of whole body-mind-\nuniverse totally exerting itself, improve itself by itself and just lose yourself in that whole process without\neven grasping or seeking for an outcome, that whole 'self' construct is unnecessary and extra. Then\nactions can be self-liberated. Otherwise, all actions just become worldly karma or actions, karmic\nactivities, that leave traces resulting and ripening in good and bad experiences in samsara but no\nliberation.\nAWAKENINGTOREALITY.COM\nTotal Exertion\nTotal Exertion\n2\n• ·\nReply\n• ·\nRemove Preview\n• · 10h\n• ·\nEdited\nSoh Wei Yu\nAdmin\n“When anatta matures, one is fully and completely integrated into whatever arises till there is no\ndifference and no distinction.\n1199\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nWhen sound arises, fully and completely embraced with sound yet non-attached.

If one ignores cause and effect one will\ndevelop false views and sever the roots of goodness. The principle of cause and effect is very clear and\nthere is no “I” in it: those who create evil will fall and those who practice good will rise, without a\nhairsbreadth of disparity between the two. If cause and effect had perished and ceased to be, then the\nbuddhas would not have appeared in the world, the founding teacher would not have come from the West,\nand sentient beings would never have met the Buddha and heard the Dharma. People like Confucius or\nLao-tse do not propound the principle of cause and effect. Only the buddhas and Zen ancestors have made\nthis clear.” – A quote of Zen Master Dogen in Yamada, Kōun. Zen: The Authentic Gate (p. 149). Wisdom\nPublications. Kindle Edition.”\n“To summarize, the principle of cause and effect is quite clear, and it is totally impersonal: those who\nfabricate evil will fall into a lower state, whereas those who practice good will rise to a higher state, and\nwithout the slightest disparity. If cause and effect had become null and void, Buddhas would never\nhave appeared in the world and our Ancestral Master would not have come from the West. In\nshort, it would be impossible for human beings to encounter a Buddha and hear the Dharma. The\nfundamental principle of cause and effect was not clear to Confucius or Lao-tzu. It has only been clarified\nand Transmitted by Buddha after Buddha and by Ancestor after Ancestor. Because the good fortune of\nthose who are seeking to learn in these degenerate days of the Dharma is scant, they do not\nencounter a genuine Master or hear the authentic Dharma, and so they are not clear about cause and\neffect. If you deny causality as a result of this error, you will experience excessive misfortune, since\nyou would be as ignorant as an ox or a horse. Even if you have not committed any evil act other than\ndenying cause and effect, the poison of this view will immediately be terrible. Therefore, if you who\nare exploring the Matter through your training with a Master have put your heart that seeks awakening\nas the first and foremost matter, and therefore wish to repay the vast benevolence of the Buddhas\nand the Ancestors, you should swiftly clarify what causality really is.” - Zen Master Dogen,\nhttps://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/088jinshiInga.pdf\n1202\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\n“Without the precepts, Zen is the work of the devil\n— Dogen Zenji”\nOn the importance of merits, something I wrote before like a decade ago:\n\"I remember years ago Thusness would have me explain the dharma to people from various forums. One\ntime many years ago I thought it would be better if Thusness explained by himself to the others, so I told\nThusness why don't you post yourself or something like that. Thusness suddenly appeared serious (he\nseldom talk in this tone) and asked me so are you going to do this or not? Then he told me the reason (not\nexact words now but along this line) he had me to do this was because I was lacking in merits to gain\nenlightenment. And then he said something like... you think I'm joking? Suddenly at that moment I realized\nwhy he was always taking the trouble and instructing me to do all those things... when he could have done\nit himself.\nNot long later I had a meditation experience... he informed me it is due to my merits ripening due to a\nparticular instance of explaining the dharma to someone some time ago. He informed me there is a direct\ncausal relation. When asked how does he know that merits is important for experience and realization, he\nsimply says this is his experience. He says it may not make a lot of sense to a dualistic mind, but this is how\nit (dependent origination) works.\nToday he no longer makes me explain this and that to others, since I am in a much better position to explain\nmyself based on my insight and experience. But even today he said one of the reasons that contributed to\nmy quick progression of insight is the merits accrued by actively participating in Dharma discussions... apart\nfrom the practice and establishment of right view.\"\nEven my breakthrough last year was the result of my actively engaging in contemplating and writing the\nAtR guide. It is all intimately connected.\n“The concept of ethics - even the word “ethics” itself - has an unpleasant connotation for many people. It\nbrings up images of overbearing, dogmatic, and abusive authority figures. It may bring up memories of\npersonal experience with rules and laws, manipulation, threats, fears, and physical punishment. Some\npeople who grow up with dogmatic ethics end up feeling a lifelong aversion to the very idea of ethics.\nIn fact, many people have moved from traditional Western religions to modern non-dual paths partly\nbecause of the freedom from dogmatic ethics they perceive in non-dualism. Non-dualism is free from the\nintolerant moralistic heaviness that can accompany traditional religions.\nBut ethics has also been taught in a generous, loving, heart-centered way, even in traditional Western\nreligions. This chapter is about heart-centered ethics. Examples are the teachings communicated by\n1203\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nChristian gospel music and the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37); by Buddhist metta\nmeditations; and by the selfless service tradition of seva in Hinduism, in which others are seen as\nmanifestations of divinity or global awareness and in which our actions should manifest ahimsa (the\nabsence of harm). Each of these examples teaches love in an inspiring, heart-opening, non-punitive way. In\nfact, for the rest of this chapter, if I use the word ‘ethics,’ I’m usually referring to heart-centered ethics.\nI would like to encourage those who articulate non-dual teachings, including myself, to incorporate an\nemphasis on heart-centered ethics.\nThere are many different systems of ethics. In this book, I’m not arguing for one specific ethical system\namong others. Rather, my point is that non-dual teachings should include some emphasis on ethical\nteachings, rather than omitting or rejecting ethics altogether.\nWhy Ethics?\nWhy am I in favor of including rather than excluding ethics? My preferences are based on my own\nexperiences, as well as on respect for the traditional paths upon which most non-dual teachings are based.\nI have two fundamental reasons to prefer that ethics be a part of non-dual teachings. One is that, years\nbefore I ever encountered non-dual teachings, learning to care for others made me happier, kinder, and\nmore peaceful. Of course, receiving heart-centered ethics teachings is no guarantee that a person will be\nhappier or kinder. But I think the odds favor it.\nThe other reason that I advocate for ethics to be part of non-dual teachings is that non-dual insight seems\nto come a lot more readily when enabled by an open heart. The discoveries are deeper and more lasting.\nHeart-centered ethics teachings, when put into use, open the heart and reduce the felt insistence that\neverything should be about oneself. This opening assists in the exact kind of inquiry used in the direct path.\nI expand upon both these reasons below.\nI can’t lay down a prescription for a particular brand of heart-centered ethics teaching, but I can say that\nthese teachings helped me become happier. They have also helped me discover for myself the insights\nspoken of in non-dual teachings…\n…it occured to me, based on my experience in various spiritual paths, that paths actually need some sort\nof heart-centered ethical teaching. I felt that paths need ethics to help with two related goals that paths\nusually have. One goal is to articulate a vision of how life should be lived. The other goal is to inspire\nstudents to work toward that vision. Even if the vision is something vague like ‘live in a free, enlightened\nway,’ I thought my chances of freedom and enlightenment would be much better if the path also had an\nethical component.\n1204\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nIt seemed that the ethical components of these paths weren’t a side issue. The ethical component seemed\nintrinsically necessary to each path’s spiritual goals.\nThere are some specific examples of the spiritual benefits of ethical teachings. In my time with various\nRosicrucian groups, I noticed an emphasis on loving one’s neighbor. In the Zen temple I attended most\nfrequently, there was a lot of emphasis on compassion and deferring to others. Compassion and deference\nwere enacted in many concrete ways. In the traditional Advaita Vedanta school where I took weekly classes\nfor several years, there was an emphasis on treating all beings as a manifestations of the highest deity.\nSometimes the teaching would advise us to treat all women as we would treat our own mother and to treat\nall men as we would treat our own father. In Tibetan Madhyamika Buddhism, I noticed a constant emphasis\non putting compassion (defined as the altruistic aspiration to achieve the highest enlightenment for the\nsake of all beings) into practice by making vows and by developing generosity, discipline, patience,\nperseverance, meditative concentration, and wisdom. Thanks to the heart-centered ethics component of\neach of these paths, my self-concern softened; I adopted a more engaged, concrete, benevolent way of\ninteracting with people; and I experienced a warm, expansive joy. I only hope that, as a result of these\nchanges in me, people found me more pleasant to be around!” ~ Greg Goode, After Awareness\nIn the Pali Canon, the Buddha taught that morality/conduct is not the goal of the path, however, it has an\nimportant role and purpose in the path. Here’s what he said,\n“An Act of Will\nCetanā Sutta (AN 11:2)\nNAVIGATIONSuttas/AN/11:2\n“For a person endowed with virtue, consummate in virtue, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May freedom\nfrom remorse arise in me.’ It is in the nature of things that freedom from remorse arises in a person\nendowed with virtue, consummate in virtue.\n“For a person free from remorse, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May joy arise in me.’ It is in the nature\nof things that joy arises in a person free from remorse.\n“For a joyful person, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May rapture arise in me.’ It is in the nature of things\nthat rapture arises in a joyful person.\n“For a rapturous person, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May my body be calm.’ It is in the nature of\nthings that a rapturous person grows calm in body.\n“For a person calm in body, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May I experience pleasure.’ It is in the nature\nof things that a person calm in body experiences pleasure.\n“For a person experiencing pleasure, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May my mind grow concentrated.’\nIt is in the nature of things that the mind of a person experiencing pleasure grows concentrated.\n1205\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\n“For a person whose mind is concentrated, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May I know & see things as\nthey have come to be.’ It is in the nature of things that a person whose mind is concentrated knows & sees\nthings as they have come to be.\n“For a person who knows & sees things as they have come to be, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May I\nfeel disenchantment.’ It is in the nature of things that a person who knows & sees things as they have come\nto be feels disenchantment.\n“For a person who feels disenchantment, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May I grow dispassionate.’ It is\nin the nature of things that a person who feels disenchantment grows dispassionate.\n“For a dispassionate person, there is no need for an act of will, ‘May I realize the knowledge & vision of\nrelease.’ It is in the nature of things that a dispassionate person realizes the knowledge & vision of release.\n“In this way, dispassion has knowledge & vision of release as its purpose, knowledge & vision of release as\nits reward. Disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose, dispassion as its reward. Knowledge & vision of\nthings as they have come to be has disenchantment as its purpose, disenchantment as its reward.\nConcentration has knowledge & vision of things as they have come to be as its purpose, knowledge & vision\nof things as they have come to be as its reward. Pleasure has concentration as its purpose, concentration\nas its reward. Calm has pleasure as its purpose, pleasure as its reward. Rapture has calm as its purpose,\ncalm as its reward. Joy has rapture as its purpose, rapture as its reward. Freedom from remorse has joy as\nits purpose, joy as its reward. Skillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose, freedom from\nremorse as their reward.\n“In this way, mental qualities lead on to mental qualities, mental qualities bring mental qualities to their\nconsummation, for the sake of going from the near to the Further Shore.””\n“The Narayana-Requested Sutra says:\nOne should not keep moral ethics to attain a kingdom, not for higher realms, not for Indra or Brahma\nstates, not for wealth, not for the Ishwara state, not for the body. Likewise, one should not protect moral\nethics by fearing rebirth in the hell realms. Likewise, the birth of animals. Nor should one protect moral\nethics by fearing rebirth in the world of Yama.\nOn the other hand, one should keep moral ethics to establish sentient beings in Buddhahood. One\nshould protect moral ethics to benefit and bring happiness to all sentient beings.\n~ pg 197 - 198, The Jewel Ornament of Liberation by Gampopa, translated by Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen\nRinpoche”\n“Krodha (Kyle Dixon) posted in Reddit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ah8zes/jigme_lingpa_how_every_action_of_life_can_be/\nPosted byu/krodha\n1 month ago\n1206\nConduct, Ethics and the Paramitas (Perfections)\nJigme Lingpa: How Every Action of Life Can Be Turned into Another Step Towards Awakening\n\"Any virtuous action that is filled with loving-kindness and compassion:\nIs generosity (dāna) when it is done for the sake of beings.\nIt is discipline (śīla) when it is free from self-interest.\nIt is patience (kshānti) when it is done untiringly for the sake of others.\nIt is heroic perseverance (vīrya) when it is done with vibrant joy.\nIt is meditation (dhyāna) when it is done with one-pointed mind.\nIt is wisdom (prajñā) when there is no clinging to it as real.\nThe six perfections are never separate from such virtuous actions.\"\n- Vidyadhara Jigme Lingpa, The yogi of the sky-like vast expanse (from The Treasury of Precious Qualities)\nCommentary from Yogi Prabodha Jñāna:\nEveryone has the innate ability to be perfectly awakened and act from the spacious expanse of\nspontaneous benevolence. However, our habituation to self-clinging and dualistic grasping obscure this\nability and make us narrow beings. If these obscurations are removed, the six perfections (pāramitā) are\nnaturally perfected. Conversely, by gradually cultivating the six perfections, these concealments can be\ntranscended. That is the Way of Six Perfections as the path to awakening. As these six are perfected, one’s\nprimordially pure nature gradually manifests to perfection as a Buddha, an awakened being.\nCultivating these six perfections are not a separate spiritual project that one needs to perform outside all\nother activities of life. As Jigme Lingpa says, any virtuous action (i.e., anything that does not harm, but\nbenefits oneself and others) can be performed as the confluence of all the six perfections. Thus, with\ntraining, one can turn every action of one’s life into another step towards Buddhahood.”\n“When you do not harbor any stinginess or prejudice whatsoever in your mind, that is the Paramita of\nGenerosity. When you can skillfully relinquish your disturbing emotions, that is the Paramita of Discipline.\nWhen you are totally free from anger and resentment, that is the Paramita of Patience. When you are\nneither lazy nor indolent, that is the Paramita of Diligence. When you are free from distraction and\nattachment to the taste of meditation, that is the Paramita of Concentration. When you are utterly free\nfrom constructed concepts, that is the Paramita of Wisdom.”\n- Padmasambhava\n[1:12 PM, 9/30/2020] John Tan: Tell me, what are 3 the most important concepts in practice you always hear\nabout taoism.

The key is just instead of being frustrated, just\ncontinue doing or solving the issue. Dissolve in the activity\nLike i wrote before in fearless samadhi, each time i had sleep paralysis since anatta there is just dissolution\ninto boundless and centerless luminosity and bliss without fear.. even if a sense of intruder appears\n[11:12 PM, 9/30/2020] John Tan: At least some improvement but still not good enough.

For example one can practice a kind\n1208\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nof tolerance but this is different from completely dissolving the self in actualization and equipoise, then\n“patience” and “equanimity” arise untainted by self even when confronted with situations.\nJust losing the background can remain an inactive perceptual level but all the paramitas are qualities of\nmind that are perfected when anatta beyond three spheres are actualised when facing situations and\npeople\nLikewise for fear\n[12:41 AM, 10/1/2020] Soh Wei Yu: *without giver,...\n[12:45 AM, 10/1/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Like just chanting..\n[12:45 AM, 10/1/2020] John Tan: Much better, but the relationship is still not clear. And it is not so correct\nto say that if anatta insight doesn't arise, you can't perfect paramitas. In fact it goes both ways.\nSo the passive and active mode of anatta. How does the gap between the actor and action being eliminated\nto none in activity?\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nPost-anatta, it is possible for the meditative equipoise of anatta to extend into the three states of waking,\ndreaming and deep sleep, into “clear light sleep” and “clear light dream”, in which the state of sleep dawns\nas non-dual luminosity/awareness, bliss and transparency without any sense of self, center or boundaries.\nIt is also possible in my (Soh’s) experiences, as well as John’s experience, to receive teachings from luminous\nvisions of majestic Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, teachers, accurate prophetic visions, and various kinds of helpful\ndream experiences called “dreams of clarity”. These dreams usually contain messages of great profundity\nthat have a very practical implication to one’s own practice and life situation. These topics are dealt with in\nmore details in books like Dream Yoga by Andrew Holecek and Stephen LaBerge, The Tibetan Yogas of\nDream and Sleep by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and Mark Dahlby, as well as Dream Yoga and the Practice of\nNatural Light by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and Michael Katz (see Book Recommendations).\n\"You don't need clarity [during sleep] like in conscious state. You only need the strength of insight to\npenetrate the 3 states (Soh: waking, dreaming, deep sleep).\" - John Tan, 2019\n“I told both of you (many years ago) not to maintain awareness in deep sleep and treat deep sleep as deepest\nsamadhi… ...in sleeping, sleep!” - John Tan, 2014\n\"Focus on wisdom and letting the strength of insights penetrate the 3 states (Soh: waking, dreaming, deep\nsleep).\" - John Tan, 2019\n1209\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\n“Treat this [clear light sleep] as the strength of wisdom manifesting in dreams with and without karmic\ntraces.” - John Tan, 2012\nBy wisdom, John Tan refers to the insight of anatta, dependent origination and emptiness (as in John Tan\nStage 5 and 6).\n“(5:06:14 PM) Thusness: even in deep dreamless sleep... Your mind/body rhythm, heart beats are affected\nby this practice. if penetrate anatta deeply...from moment to moment...thoroughly letting go of self and\ngrasping and vivid presence, how is it that such practice will not affect the 3 states?\n(5:14:39 PM) AEN: hmm… but in deep dreamless sleep if there is no conscious awareness how can there\nbe an ongoing practice?\n(5:16:26 PM) Thusness: the entire movement is not a matter of conscious awareness. the momentum\ncontinues...the body, the cells are imprinted too. much like your deep held attachments. all inter-\npenetrates. your body can contract unnecessarily. “ - Conversation with John Tan, 2010\n“When absence is maintained and you are able to sink into bed, and find that perfect restful position,\nliterally fall asleep, then you will wake up as you had fallen asleep; knowing, without question, that the\n‘practice’ had run its course throughout those hours of deep sleep. There’s no need to be conscious of it\nthroughout to know that that state of absence had been continuous and uninterrupted. You know, because\nthere is no change in the way you feel from when you fell asleep with where you’re at after waking up. It’s\nas if you just blinked.” - David Vardy\n“In fact after anatta experience and insights, I have so many episodes of energy release, dreams of clarity…\nI don’t consider that as A&P but genuine openings. But those are not the essence. It just made you more\ndiligent in practice.” - John Tan, 2018\n\"...what is sleep to you from the perspective of anatta and dependent origination? Life is the total activity\nof life. Death is the total activity of death. Sleep is the total activity of sleep. This is the total training and\npractice. Unless you are leaving trace, it is anatta. So life and death, sleep and practice, breathing in and\nbreathing out... all are same practice, same view, same truth, same fruition.\" - John Tan, 2014\nA facebook conversation in June 2013:\nhttp://dharmaconnectiongroup.blogspot.com/2013/06/lucid-dreaming-dreams-of-clarity-more_22.html\nLucid Dreaming, Dreams Of Clarity & Clear Light Sleep\nSoh:\n1210\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nI've had many episodes in the past where I was in conscious lucid dreams, and then the lucid dreams\ndisappeared into pure non-dual Presence, pure knowingness, and it was profoundly blissful. Very very\nblissful. Samadhi like.\nLast night, it was like that again, except the dreams never disappeared - I was walking to my dream toilet\nin profound bliss and awareness was totally transparent and non-dual - the entire dream toilet\nsurroundings was experienced without subject/object dichotomy, there is no sense of a center or\ncircumference left, only vivid transparency. And it was intensely blissful...\nThe difference between this and previous experiences is that in previous instances, there was a dissolution\ninto formless pure presence, while this time it is like non-dual clear light is experienced within dreams\ninstead of dissolution of dream.\nJust a sharing. I'm not a good practitioner, this sort of thing doesn't occur on a daily basis. I'm sure many\nare more experienced than I am.\nSoh: By the way, not toilet, its bathroom. (In Singapore we use the terms synonymously, lol)\nDannon Flynn: This is the clear light of sleep.\nSoh: Found a passage from Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche's 'The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep'' book, it is\nprecise in description:\nCLEAR LIGHT DREAMS\nThere is a third type of dream that occurs when one is far along the path, the clear light dream. It arises\nfrom the primordial prana in the central channel. The clear light is generally spoken of in the teachings\nabout sleep yoga and indicates a state free from dream, thought, and image, but there is also a clear light\ndream in which the dreamer remains in the nature of mind. This is not an easy accomplishment; the\npractitioner must be very stable in non-dual awareness before the clear light dream arises. Gyalshen Milu\nSamleg, the author of important commentaries on the Mother Tantra, wrote that he practiced consistently\nfor nine years before he began to have clear light dreams.\nDeveloping the capacity for clear light dreams is similar to developing the capacity of abiding in the non-\ndual presence of rigpa during the day. In the beginning, rigpa and thought seem different, so that in the\nexperience of rigpa there is no thought, and if thought arises we are distracted and lose rigpa. But when\nstability in rigpa is developed, thought simply arises and dissolves without in the least obscuring rigpa; the\npractitioner remains in non-dual awareness. These situations are similar to learning to play the drum and\nbell together in ritual practice: in the beginning we can only do one at a time. If we play the bell, we lose the\nrhythm of the drum, and vice versa. After we are stable we can play both at the same time.\n1211\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nThe clear light dream is not the same as the dream of clarity, which, while arising from deep and relatively\npure aspects of the mind and generated from positive karmic traces, still takes place in duality. The clear\nlight dream, while emerging from the karmic traces of the past, does not result in dualistic experience. The\npractitioner does not reconstitute as an observing subject in relation to the dream as an object, nor as a\nsubject in the world of the dream, but abides wholly integrated with non-dual rigpa.\nThe differences in the three kinds of dreams may seem subtle. Samsaric dream arises from the individual's\nkarmic traces and emotions, and all content of the dream is formed by those traces and emotions. The\ndream of clarity includes more objective knowledge, which arises from collective karmic traces and is\navailable to consciousness when it is not entangled in personal karmic traces. The consciousness is then\nnot bound by space and time and personal history, and the dreamer can meet with real beings, receive\nteachings from real teachers, and find information helpful to others as well as to him or herself.\nThe clear light dream is not defined by the content of the dream, but is a clear light dream because there\nis no subjective dreamer or dream ego, nor any self in a dualistic relationship with the dream or the dream\ncontent. Although a dream arises, it is an activity of the mind that does not disturb the practitioner's stability\nin clear light.\n。。。。。。。。。。。。\n\"Although we define sleep as unconsciousness, the darkness and experiential blankness are not the\nessence of sleep. For the pure awareness that is our basis there is no sleep. When not afflicted with\nobscurations, dreams, or thoughts, the moving mind dissolves into the nature of mind; then, rather than\nthe sleep of ignorance, clarity, peacefulness, and bliss arise. When we develop the ability to abide in that\nawareness we find that sleep is luminous. This luminosity is the clear light. It is our true nature.\nAs explained in previous chapters, dreams arise from karmic traces. I used the analogy of light being\nprojected through film to make movies, where the karmic traces are the photographs, awareness is the\nlight that illuminates them, and the dreams are projected on the base (kunzhi*). Dream yoga develops\nlucidity in relationship to the dream images. But in sleep yoga there is no film and no projection. Sleep yoga\nis imageless. The practice is the direct recognition of awareness by awareness, light illuminating itself. It is\nluminosity without images of any kind. Later, when stability in the clear light is developed, even dream\nimages will not distract the practitioner, and the dream period of sleep will also occur in the clear light.\nThese dreams are then called clear light dreams, which are different than dreams of clarity. In clear light\ndreams, the clear light is not obscured.\nWe lose the real sense of the clear light as soon as we conceptualize it or try to imagine it. There is neither\nsubject nor object in the clear light. If there is any identification with a subject, then there is no entry into\nthe clear light. Actually, nothing \"enters\" the clear light: the clear light is the base recognizing itself. There\n1212\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nis neither \"you\" nor \"it.\" Using dualistic language to describe the non- dual necessarily results in paradox.\nThe only way to know the clear light is to know it directly.\"\nSoh: I have lots of dreams of clarity as well (just had another one yesterday as well)... though they often tell\nme very helpful information about my practise, sometimes involve receiving teachings from teachers, and\nsometimes it shows future events which are very accurate, but there is not that sort of non-dual lucidity of\nclear light to those dreams.\nJoel Rosenblum: Thanks for sharing, Soh. I have had the dissolving into pure presence dreams, but not yet\nthe third type you speak of. I have also met with dhamma masters in a few dreams, which is always\nencouraging. It definitely helps for me to set my intentions and meditate before sleep, and then to wake\nup very early and repeat.\nAlbert Hong: Soh I just had a dream where I ended up at some large apartment complex then I was in the\ncenter of the apartments which became a large sangha of zen students. All lay folks. I saw grey robes and\neveryone was doing walking meditation.\nIt seems there is a certain kind of dream. It may be called lucid but even then. These dreams have a odd\nquality to them as if they were recollections or a higher order of dreaming.\nEither way I was very shocked to find a zen center in a random apartment complex with a huge sangha.\nThere was a definite feel of being a visitor because they wrote my name down.\nAnyways just some thoughts.\nSoh: Albert, do you mean you were recalling that sangha through dream? Have you found that zen center\nin real life?\nThe last time I dreamt of a zen center, I followed that dream and ended up going to that zen center (for the\nfirst time) that very day and saw the exact scene played out in my dream as I mentioned in\nhttp://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/10/total-exertion.html\nAwakening to Reality: Total Exertion\nAlbert Hong: Nope. But I have dreamt places and found them in real life.\nAnother note i've had about five of these odd dreams. Each time after the dream I feel very refreshed as if\nI showered and rested well.\n1213\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nBut i've never seen this place. The place was very magical or rather unconventional.\nSoh: Yes! I woke up very refreshed today as well.\nThe number of hours of sleep also decrease and you begin the day beaming with energy and radiance. Just\nas John wrote in 2007:\nJohn: for non-dual experiencer where there is complete letting go of the illusory self, there is tremendous\nprogress and if night they are able to, is there real progress? then they complete the first cycle.\nSoh: what do you mean by first cycle\nJohn: almost 'be' in all 3 stages (waking, dream, deep sleep)\nSoh: What do you mean by cycles\nJohn: when you have a very deep sleep, what happened next morning?\nSoh: very awake?\nJohn: what else?\nSoh: mind is clear? dunno\nJohn: continue… right\nSoh: the mind becomes less active?\nJohn: awake, clear, fresh, energetic, vibrant. aren't that the seven factors? for a non-dual experiencer, the\nnext day is even so. the intensity is even more fantastic. if this is continuously sustained, will the sleep\nnaturally be shortened? isn't it natural? isn't the seven factors of enlightenment maintained? so know that\nwhat is right and correctly discerned. buddha's depth of clarity is unsurpassed. we cannot compare one\nthat has reached that stage of clarity\n..........\nJohn: and later stage when meditation is stabilized using non-dual and the door of impermanence, then\nthere will be deep sleep with absolutely no problem but the no. of sleeping hours naturally lessen. and\nthere is no problem like her case. but that is not a problem because of deep rest and sleep and allowing\nour emptiness to manifest. we will feel radiance bright instead of zoombieness....hehehe\n1214\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nSoh: Just found a passage in 2006 where John described what I experienced. And he is very right in pointing\nout the vast difference between 1) maintaining a state of witnessing awareness in sleep, which is dualistic,\nor 2) lucid dream, as compared to 3) non-dual knowing in dream and sleep.\nJohn: the strength in the waking state of total presence is the experience of all physical phenomenon arising\nas pure awareness. but when in dreams, such experience must sustain. that is instead of the physical\nappearance of phenomenon arising, it is symbolic appearance of arising as the manifestation of pure\nawareness. not a form of intellectual knowledge. just like the experience of anatta in waking state, the same\nexperience extended to dreamstate. it is entirely different. it is difficult for me to tell you. when one\nexperience the experience of no-self during waking state, one experience total nothingness and absolute\ntransparency but has no single doubt that all and everything is awareness. means he is completely clear\nyet totally transparent. in dreams, it is difficult to maintain totally no-self and the symbols as pure\nawareness. that is very different from being aware in dreams. this is dualistic still in dream state. that\nexperience of anatta in waking state is not being experienced in dream state. this is different from being\naware in dreams like an observer. one step higher than lucid dreams, you get what I mean or not?\n...\nJohn: and most people mistaken it as maintaining presence and awareness in dreams as in the form of\npassive witness\n...\nJohn: that is maintaining presence. not sustaining the experience of anatta - the total transparency but as\neverything\nSoh: but anatta is also presence isn’t it?\nJohn: anatta is the experience of total presence in totally different forms every moment\nSoh: then what’s the difference between maintain presence and anatta\nJohn: no... anatta is the experience of total presence. manifesting in different forms from moment to\nmoment. It is the experience of total and absolute transparency, without boundary and limit. total vividness\nand clarity. absolute transparency is difficult to maintain and can only result from increasing loosening of\nthe bond I told you. Not the result of effort. That is why this state must be completely and fully stabilized\nduring waking state. Total transparent awareness is experiencing everything as awareness. and during\ndreamstate this is the case too. This is very difficult to achieve. Not maintaining wakefulness and a sense\nof presence during the 3 states.\n1215\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nTommy McNally: Something similar happened to me a few weeks ago, the dream collapsed consciously\nrevealing what you've described as \"formless pure presence\". I was totally lucid throughout but there was\njust an instant where the entire 'thing' literally collapsed, like something out of the movie \"Inception\",\nleaving 'something' I can't even describe. Apparently it's possible to realize the Sambhogakaya through the\nsort of lucidity you describe so it sounds like a really good indicator. Thanks for posting this!\nJanuary 25 at 7:37am · Like · 1\nDannon Flynn: Soh, this may be off topic, but \"following\" dreams like you did is a very interesting practice.\nMost folks would think that the dream-state and waking life are completely independent of each other, or\nthat only causes in waking life can effect dreams, but not the other way around. When one \"follows\" dreams\nlike you did one becomes aware that the dream-state and waking life are also completely seamlessly\ninterdependent as well. One sees underlying patterns. It seems as if one can shape one's waking life by\nmanipulating dreams. Or that one can let dreams guide one through waking life, exploring chains of cause\nand effect in dreams in order to make wise choices. It seems as if dreams can tell the future or see into the\nfuture.\nSoh: Wrote this in UT:\nThere was another more recent experience but involving sleep paralysis... you know sometimes in sleep\nparalysis you may feel a bit frightened and creeped out... or there may be a sense that there are other\nbeings around (called 'the intruder' according to wiki on sleep paralysis). I felt that 'intruder' thing again but\nthis time there was no fear and I gave rise to the intention to pervade the whole room with its apparent\nbeings with the bright luminosity of mind/awareness. And because I was conscious and kept releasing,\nthere was no fear and instead sleep paralysis turned into bliss and luminosity like the previous experiences,\nawareness was again experienced as vivid transparency, centerless and borderless, no observer/observed\nduality just vivid transparency appearing as what appeared to be my dark room surroundings.\nThen suddenly a weird white flash of light came, very strong and simultaneously there was this almost\nfrightening BOOM! like a nuclear bomb exploded... very very loud sound. Though shocking there was not\nreally fear in it but a thought arose right then \"what the hell happened\"... but later on I woke up... I found\nout later it’s not an uncommon thing, think it’s called \"Exploding head syndrome\". Happens in astral travel\nand sleep paralysis. Incidentally astral travel and sleep paralysis are linked (have experienced OBE in sleep\nparalysis).\nBut the main thing is that throughout the whole thing there was no fear and it was blissful... because sleep,\nor rather sleep paralysis, became clear light.\nSo from my experience... waking, deep sleep, dream, sleep paralysis can dawn as clear light.\nElsewhere Soh also wrote in 2013 on some of the other examples of dream experiences:\n1216\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\n“Yesterday a dream of clarity arose in conjunction with John's visions and meditative experiences (due to\nkarmic links this is not the first time it happened) regarding a drop of water placed in an ocean, upon\nhearing this phrase in the dream there was an immediate shift where dream dawns as non-dual clear light\n(without the dream dissolving into formless clear light) which is free from subject/object duality,\nboundless/oceanic, vividly intense, blissful and exhilarating.”\n“Before I woke up I dreamt that I was in my mother's car and she was driving me around, and she said\nsomething like there is only one sound. This struck me as peculiar, but almost instantly I was led to see how\nall the sense doors are just one door. Suddenly a shift of perception took place and everything seen and\nfelt is just the whole universe, the whole field of experience as one seamlessly integrated form that is great,\nmarvelous and boundless, without any sense of an observer - there is only just that integrated form vividly\nhappening right there, all happening while I know that it is a dream. It became very blissful. After that I\nwoke up.”\nTo which the dharma teacher Daniel M. Ingram wrote, “the insights of that dream clearly relate to both\nformations and volumetric field sense integration”.\n“Fearless Samadhi\nSomeone asked me to explain the paragraph, \"...Lastly what that is ‘unborn, pristine and luminous’ cannot\nbe “dependent and inseparable from the transient” appears sound only logically but not experientially. It\nwill first seem illogical and unnatural to accept such an idea, but when the tendency to dualify and solidify\nexperience subsides, then scenery, taste, scent, sound, breathe, the sensation of our feet touching the\nground…all arising will help lighten this psychological pain. Therefore fearlessly, unreservedly and\ncompletely open to whatever arises.\"\nI wrote:\nThere can be the false misconception that awareness is inherently existing and distinct from transient\nexperience. This is dualistic and tends to solidify the subject/object structure, the sense that I am I and\nexperience is apart from myself.\nIn sleep paralysis, for example, there can be a situation where there is deep fear due to the sense of an\nintruder or some fearful 'other'. But in my experience, if there is recognition of the nondual and empty\nnature of mind/experience, there is liberation in that very instant.\nIn my previous four times I had sleep paralysis (and I haven't had any recently), each time the structure of\nsubject/object is dissolved in transparent bliss and boundless clarity. The sense of myself being here facing\na fearful 'other' or intruder completely dissolves naturally into boundless bliss and presence even as it\narises. I no longer get locked in that fearful situation.\n1217\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nThere is complete fearless dissolving into whatever appears, seen, heard, smelled, etc. And you will love to\ndissolve, to die, in a sense, without resistance, without choosing to be in another situation. This very\nsituation, condition, appearance, whatever it is, is your nature, empty-clarity.\nAnd this is why in the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\", there is an emphasis on the recognition of whatever\ndeities - wrathful and peaceful, as simply a display of your own state, your own nature, essence and energy.\nThey are not apart from yourself, so do not fear them, but recognise them as your very Presence.” - Soh\n“[4/8/19, 8:09:47 AM] John Tan: You told me about your dream the other day about being centerless and\nspeaking to your mum. I think that is very important and precious.\n[4/8/19, 12:55:25 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Hmm.. but wasn't very long or intense.. but it's like even in the midst of\nactions and speaking I was doing in the dream was experienced with a vivid centerless boundless quality\n[4/8/19, 1:56:34 PM] John Tan: In the dream but vivid centerless boundless quality isn't strong?\n[4/8/19, 1:59:46 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Centerless and boundless but wasn't particularly intense I think.

Most of my practices in dreams are intense, in fact more intense than\nwaking. But it is good that it penetrates into the 3 states.\n[4/8/19, 2:01:55 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. yeah sleep are usually intense. The tibetans are right to say dream\nand bardo are 7 times more intense lol. Sleep in general\n[4/8/19, 2:03:48 PM] John Tan: Malcolm said bardo practices are for Vajrayana practitioners. For others they\nwill not experience the bardo states.\n[4/8/19, 2:33:10 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. what he said was that the visions of bardo, as in the specific Vajrayana\ndeities will not be experienced by normal people. But the bardo being seven times more intense applies\nfor everyone I think. As in that state it is said that one’s consciousness is not restricted by the coarse [bodily]\nsenses and mind or something like that\n[4/8/19, 4:20:30 PM] John Tan: Yes.”\n“(4:14 PM) John: i will tell you when is the condition is right for one to enter into dream and dreamless\npractice of presence. First is the experience of anatta must be stabilized. So much so that sense of 'self'\ntotally dissolved as it has never existed from beginning. Presence is a transparent thus taking place.\nNothing within and without. This must be thorough and stabilized during the waking state. Second, one\nmust be able to meditate for quite a prolong period of time (at least 1.5 hrs and above) with complete\nstillness of the body, there will come a time that the body\nis so still that there is absolutely no burden and one can do away with it. This resulted in a state that the\nbody is no different from sleep, a state of complete rest in meditation posture\n(4:19 PM) John: when these 2 conditions are present, the practitioner actually experience sleep during\nmeditation.\n(4:20 PM) John: that is, the body is undergoing sleep. How do we know...coz the practitioner will\nexperience the body all the syndromes of sleep (might snore also)...hehe\n1218\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\n(4:20 PM) John: but the presence is there. Then he is ready. Ready to enter the dream and dreamless\nstate in meditation. He will experience the bliss and samadhi. :) otherwise, one should keep away. Because\nit will present more problems when the body is denied the necessary rest, revitalization and recharge when\nthe conditions are there. And a practitioner does not how to recoil and return back to normal. We will know\nas we can observe whether one is ready through the stillness of meditation posture and the experience of\nanatta. This is my view. :) Because I know that many masters are not that ready to advise people to enter\ninto those stages, it is better to keep oneself away from getting into such experimentation. It can cause\ngreat suffering that even doctors and specialists can't help. :) When one's experience of presence gets more\nintense, meditation should change to morning and evening. That to me is the best. :) This is especially\nimportant for lay practitioner.\n(4:26 PM) AEN: why\n(4:28 PM) John: because lay practitioner has a lot of other stuff to cope in daily life\n(4:28 PM) John: lol”\n“Sleep kundalini\nA teacher appeared in my sleep yesterday and guided me into clear nondual presence. and as i went into\nit i felt this presence and state of absorption grew more and more and more intense until the bliss was so\nincredible that I woke up. and even a while after I woke up I still felt the bliss energy and vibrations going\nup from bottom to top through the base of my spine up to my nape through my sushumna nadi (central\nchannel). This was slightly different from previous instances where it was more related to something like\nheart chakra.\nThen something somewhat miraculous happened — keep in mind my mind was super awake and blissful\nafter I woke up and although it was 4am I was not in a dreamlike state. I saw my hands glowing with light.\nAt first I thought it was coming from my watch but I checked, I was not wearing one.

It\nwas pure presence/beingness and bliss without consciousness of any sort of object (or subject), and no\nother sensory or mental experiences whatsoever.\" Note the emphasis on \"other .. experiences.\" So this\nwas itself an experience. According to Advaita, it may seem too uneventful to be a dream, so we like to\nthink of it as deep sleep. Even Ken Wilber has misinterpreted the deep sleep teachings by saying that he\nhad developed a witness that was able to witness deep sleep. But in the Direct Path, deep sleep itself is\nthe witness. It is awareness with no objects whatsoever. So the appearance of clear light, according to\nthose teachings, is sufficient to make it a dream. A helpful one to be sure, but a dream. From the\nperspective of the Advaita teachings on deep sleep, not even clear light or I AM or any imputation or\nphenomenon appears, no matter how impressive or subtle. What is instructive about deep sleep is that\nthere is no arising whatsoever, yet awareness ... IS. When we try to look back on deep sleep, (we can't\nliterally look back on it - this is a provisional teaching only), but when we look back at it, we are led to\nseveral significant insights: 1. There was no evidence of mind, body or world. 2. Yes I was not absent. That\nis, I didn't disappear, only to reappear when I woke up. 3. I slept happily.

A direct realization that 'Awareness IS' is direct\nrealization... no doubt at all, but pure apprehension of Awareness as the essence of mind... without any\ninference at all, only a direct non-conceptual certainty. But to see it as changeless Self throughout all\nstates is an imputation and precisely is self-view. It is a 'view' or 'understanding' derived from an inherent\nview and subtle referencing. As I was telling Jax, I differentiate I AM realization with I AM imputation. I AM\nimputation is a result of referencing. During my I AM days I also had the view that Awareness is\nchangeless throughout waking, dream and deep sleep. That sort of view is seen through in anatta. As I\nwrote based on what Thusness wrote back in 2007: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/07/spell-\nof-karmic-propensities.html ...So when momentum is in action, we cannot help but react with our karmic\npatterns. If we were to ask, \"If you lost your shoe, are you still you?\" or \"If you lost your hands, do you still\nexist?\". It almost seems certain to say \"Yes, of course I am still I.\" because we always assumed there is a\ntruly existing \"Self\" experiencing changes.

This means that the mind is no longer\nsearching for it's true nature. It is no longer making efforts to \"know\" or \"understand\" something. Instead,\n1227\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nthere is resting in one's true nature, in being. This is about letting go of the need to know. And trusting.\nAnd just being. True freedom lies in surrender and acceptance. you replied: To find one that can\ncompletely surrender and totally be is extremely rare. Not even one in millions. Yet in deep sleep, all has\nto let go. How can one be denied such a precious state of beingness. For a person that has experienced\nno-self (non-duality), deep sleep is even more important. It is the completion of a full cycle of non-duality\nand natural beingness. But this may not be the case for one that clings to the \"Eternal Witnessing\". There\nis a very subtle holding in them for maintaining this witnessing subconciously thereby denying them from\nnaturally going into deep sleep. If it reaches a point that presents itself as a problem, it is a signal to the\npractitioner that it is time to let go and dissolve the holding of the Witness, the center. It will be tough to\nsimply try just \"let go\" of the center and if this is the case, an insight into our \"emptiness nature\" may\nhelp. Only after going through a full cycle of natural non-duality and beingness in all three states will a\npractitioner sleep be shorten. I called this the second cycle of non-duality.\nJohn TanSaturday, February 15, 2014 at 12:23am UTC+08\nIn fact I told you not to practice that way cause you asked me before.

When there is one, there is two. When\nthe one subsides, nothing isn't the one Reality. Clear transparency of the One Reality also has its problem.\nAn illumination into the non-duality without certain pre-requiste can cause problems. There is always\nhabitual propensities that will again make this experience an object of attachment. It can cause a person\n1228\nPenetration of Wisdom into Sleep\nto go without sleep as the body is incapable of dealing with this new found experience. Many have\nmistaken this to be a heightening of awareness and took it as a natural progression. This is not true.\nWhenever this happens, know that it is due to attachment. Learn how to let go of everything until a\ntranquil calmness arise, it has got to do with our thought patterns, there must come this willingness to let\ngo of our body completely, then our thoughts and the experience of presence...completely letting go from\nmoment to moment...the senses and thoughts can be shut by this art of letting go and non-attachment.\nTotal letting go and vivid Presence must fuse into one. Practice during the waking state till the there is no\nsingle trace of doubt that there is absolutely no one there, no inner and no outer, just the incredible\nrealness and vividness of the manifestation. The experience of non-dual in the waking state. Witnessing\ndreams and there is no witness, just dreams is different. Dealing with the more subtle states and pre-\nconscious propensites require one to master this art of non-attachment, non-action. There is no\nconscious way of dealing with the more subtle states, just stabilized the experience and allow the\nmomentum to carry us naturally into the dream and deep sleep.

From Chan Newsletter No.19, February 1982\nWhen Chan Master Gaofeng Yuanmiao (1238-1295) met Chan Master Xueyan Zuqin (1216-1287), the latter\nasked him: “You’ve been practicing for so long. At this point, do you have mastery of yourself when you\nare awake?” That is to say, when you are awake, can you not think about things you should not, and can\nyou not do what you should not? Gaofeng immediately replied: “Yes.” This is already very good. Only\nsomeone who has practiced for along time would be able to say yes. Xueyan questioned him again: “At\nnight in your dreams, do you have mastery of yourself?” And again Gaofeng answered, “Yes.” Xueyan then\nasked a third question: “When you are sleeping and not dreaming, where is the master then?”\nNow Gaofeng had already been working on wu for quite a long time, but this question completely\nstumped him. [The practice of asking a question like, “What is wu (emptiness)?” is called huatou, and is\nrelated to the practice of gong’an (Jap., koan).] He repeated the question to himself but could not give an\nanswer. So Xueyan told Gaofeng: “From now on, do not study Buddhadharma, do not read sutras or\ncommentaries; just practice. And how does one practice? When you are hungry, eat; when you are sleepy,\ngo to sleep. After sleeping, get up and practice.”\nFrom that time onward, when Gaofeng was hungry, he ate, when he felt tired, he slept, and just tried\npractice hard. And what was his practice? He asked the question, “Where is my master?” Even during his\nsleep, he continued, “Where is my master?”\nFrom that time onward, when Gaofeng was hungry, he ate, when he felt tired, he slept, and just tried to\npractice hard. And what was his practice? He asked the question, “Where is my master?” Even during his\nsleep, he continued, “Where is my master?”\nThere are various stages involved here. The first one is whether we can be our own master when we are\nawake. What we do not want to think, we will not think; what we do not want to do, we will not do. How\nmany of you can be your own master in this sense? If not, why not? By answering positively to the first\nquestion, Gaofeng showed that he was on a higher level of attainment than an ordinary person.\nTo be one’s own master in dreams is an even higher attainment. It means that you can control your own\nbehavior in your dreams, and moreover, you can control the type and content of the dreams. You will not\nhave random or meaningless dreams, and while dreaming, you have a very clear mind. This kind of\nperson is actually still practicing while dreaming. He or she always maintains right mindfulness or\n1230\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nvirtuous thoughts, that is, he will not do or think anything in the dream that is not considered permissible\nin daily life. To be one’s own master in your dreams means that you continue the same practice while\ndreaming that you do during the day. If you prostrate to the Buddha during the day, then you will\ncontinue prostrating in the dream. If you recite Buddha’s name, then even in dreams you still recited\nBuddha’s name. If you are delivering sentient beings, then you also deliver sentient beings in your\ndreams. If you are working on a huatou then even in dreams the huatou will not leave you.\nNot to have dreams at all is on a higher level still, and difficult to accomplish. It is already very good if you\ncan reach the level where you no longer have any confusing or evil dreams, but it is very hard for the\nordinary person to not dream at all. Sages have dreamless sleep; they are just in a state of rest. Master\nGaofeng had already reached the level where, at least most of the time, he was able to sleep without\ndreaming. But does that mean that all of his problems had been resolved? Actually, being able to sleep\nwithout dreaming only indicates that he had very good samadhi power. It does not necessarily mean he\nwas enlightened.\nTherefore the question that Xueyan put to him was very appropriate, and it became a huatou for\nGaofeng. He just kept on asking himself, “[When I’m asleep and not dreaming,] where is my master?”\nBecause asking this question aroused a great doubt in his mind, Gaofeng kept asking this question for\nfive years. However, remember that even before he started on this huatou, he had already reached the\nstate where he was his own master when awake as well when he was dreaming. So his practice involved a\nvery long process up to this point.\nOne evening Gaofeng woke up from sleep and reached for his pillow. At that point, the pillow fell to the\nfloor with a thud. At the sound, Gaofeng shouted, “Aha! Now I have found you!” The cloud of doubt was\ndispelled; he emerged from the “barrel of black pitch” and saw the light. This is an example of one\npractitioner’s path to enlightenment.\n(From Chan Newsletter No.19, February 1982)\n- Venerable Sheng Yen”\nTips on Energy Imbalances\n(Also see: Potential Sleep Disruptions under the chapter on Stage 1)\n“Energy must flow and [be] circular.” - John Tan, 2019\nWe should do somatic, energy and yogic practices that help to circulate energy.

Already, it was affecting my\nthought patterns, my focus, my ability to work in a rather significant manner. On the last day of it I felt I\ncould not operate my vehicle to go home. Was considering to take leave if symptoms persisted. But\nmiraculously all those symptoms just vanished all of a sudden on that day.\nYet mine was not as bad was John Tan's or AF Richard or others back in the days:\nhttp://www.actualfreedom.com.au/.../list.../listdclaudiu.htm\n• [Richard]: ‘The official term for insanity these days, due in no small part to the medicalisation of\npsychiatry, is mental illness/mental disorder ... and it was mainly because of such medicalisation that\nprofessional diagnosis came about.\nAs briefly as possible: at one stage during *a thirty-month involuntary and incessant excitation of the\nbrain cells* (officially diagnosed as being ‘an excess of dopamine in the post-synaptic receptors’) after\nbecoming actually free from the human condition I vaguely recalled, from my art-college days, that a\nperson experiencing what was colloquially known as a ‘bad trip’ on lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could\nbe brought down with an injection of some medication or another so I popped into the nearest medical\ncentre to where I was then residing and an elderly general practitioner (with very shaky hands) referred\nme to a specialist as a matter of course.\nFor more details about that neuronal agitation copy-paste the following, as-is, into the search-box at\nGoogle: excitation of the brain cells site:www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/ You will get you about 17\nhits’. [emphasis added]. Actual Freedom Mailing List, No. 111, 6 May 2006\nPut succinctly: it was that ‘thirty-month involuntary and incessant excitation of the brain cells’ – otherwise\nknown as ‘neuronal agitation’/ ‘cerebral agitation’ – which brought the totally new way of being conscious\n(a completely original consciousness) for all humankind to avail themselves of, into existence.\n(Hence that epithet ‘genitor’ being a most apt descriptor inasmuch it explicitly conveys the radical nature\ninherent to the genesis of this epoch-changing consciousness).\nAs it was altogether a ghastly/ horrendous period – I refer to it as being ‘macabre and gruesome’ in\n‘Richard’s Journal’ for instance – I was well-pleased that none of that daring handful of pioneers, circa late\n2009/early 2010, underwent anything of that nature.\n(So as to convey some idea of what it entailed I have, on occasion, likened the intensity of that involuntary\nand incessant synaptic reconfiguration to what it would be like, after having physically gashed an arm or\nleg deeply, to then spend the next 30+ months dragging the sharp point of a sewing-needle back-and-\nforth through that gash 24/7, without any let-up whatsoever, and with all of modern medicine’s arsenal of\ndrugs only exacerbating/ magnifying the intensity).\nACTUALFREEDOM.COM.AU\nMailing List 'D' Claudiu / Beoman Claudiu Dragon Emu Fire Golem\nMailing List 'D' Claudiu / Beoman Claudiu Dragon Emu Fire Golem\n1233\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nSoh Wei Yu\nSo I'm glad that so far, with right pointers, none of those here in AtR had to suffer the same thing, at least\nnot to the extent of its intensity and duration.

Have you written about it in detail?\nRICHARD: Yes.\nRESPONDENT: If so, where can I read about it?\nRICHARD: Here is one instance:\n• [Co-Respondent]: ‘... what ‘process’ was going on for six months in 1981 and thirty months in 1993-4\nwhen you were ‘unstable as all get out’?\n• [Richard]: ‘The medical diagnosis was that there was an excess of dopamine in the post-synaptic\nreceptors ... an excitation of the brain cells, which was happening of its own accord irregardless of events,\nand thus not under voluntary control.\nThese days I am in agreement with that determination as some considerable light was thrown upon it all\na few years ago when I drank three cups of strong coffee (I only drink decaffeinated coffee nowadays) in a\ntwo-hour period and it set-off a psychotropic episode lasting 5-6 hours ... an episode indistinguishable\nfrom what was occurring in 1981 and 1993-1994.\nI have since found out that caffeine is a chemical cousin to cocaine (chemical not biological) ... and, as a\nsimilar episode occurred a couple of years ago as a result of having a dental injection to anaesthetise the\njaw, I now make sure the dentist uses a procaine mixture which does not contain adrenaline, which most\nsuch mixtures do, because its effect is also psychotropic.\nI am also hypersensitive to alcohol ... even a liqueur chocolate has a deleterious effect.\nAnd here is another:\n• [Co-Respondent]: ‘Richard, you have said that caffeinated coffee sets off a psychotropic experience for\nyou. Can you elaborate please?\n• [Richard]: ‘As I understand it, and I am not a pharmacologist, caffeine is a chemical cousin to cocaine\n(having never ingested the latter I cannot provide an experiential comparison) in that its chemical sum\nformula is similar:\n• caffeine: (chem.) a crystalline alkaloid, C8H10N4O2, which is found esp. in tea and coffee plants and is a\ncentral nervous system stimulant; caffeinism: n. headache, sleeplessness, and palpitations caused by\nexcessive intake of caffeine.\n• cocaine: an alkaloid, C17H21NO4, which is present in the leaves and other parts of the coca shrub and is\nused as a local anaesthetic and as a stimulant; cocainism: n. (the condition due to) excessive use of or\naddiction to cocaine. (Oxford Dictionary).\nA psychiatrist (who, unlike a psychologist, has a medical degree) once explained to me that my on-going\nday-to-day experience is because of an excess of dopamine in the post-synaptic receptors – similar to the\neffect cocaine or amphetamine or lysergic acid diethylamide produce – hence my understanding is that to\ningest caffeine on top of this moment-to-moment experiencing is somewhat similar to overdosing on\nthose substances ... primarily the main symptom is a saturated sensuosity of such brilliance and vividity\n(as in psychedelic), which satiation can be likened to a television set receiving 4 or 5 channels all at once\n1238\nTips on Energy Imbalances\n(inasmuch thought, and thus speech, is unable to keep up with the resultant cacophonic ‘white noise’),\nthat the brain cells themselves undergo a non-volitional (chemical) excitation of such a magnitude as to\nbe almost impossible for awareness to sustain itself (as in too much to bear).\nIt is altogether unpleasant, to say the least.\nSome peoples I have spoken to about this have initially been rather envious (given that having a cup or\ntwo of strong java, then, is the equivalent of dropping a tab of acid (or snorting a line of coke) until I\nexplain that to OD on LSD (aka ‘have a bad trip’) on maybe a thrice-daily basis is not a particularly\npleasant way of living a life.\nAs I have not taken either amphetamine nor methamphetamine, which are also classified as central\nnervous system (CNS) stimulants, I cannot make an experiential comparison there either but I have read,\nfor example, that methylphenidate (such as ‘Ritalin’) – also a CNS stimulant – is a dopamine reuptake\ninhibitor ... which means that it increases the level of the dopamine neurotransmitter in the brain by\npartially blocking the transporters that remove it from the synapses.\n(snipped)\nAnd before the incident with the caffeine overdose here is an example of how I described the 1981\nexperience:\n• [Richard]: ‘I had a constant pressure-pain in the base of my skull for six months after my 1981\nexperience (and for thirty months after my 1992 experience). This pressure-pain waxed and waned in\nintensity and would produce a convulsive jerking of my left leg for periods varying from five minutes to an\nhour. I have had flashing lights ‘zapping’ in front of my eyes; I have had ‘rushes’ of energy surging up\nthrough my diaphragm; I have had intense tingling sensations on the surface of my skin; I have had liquid\nsounds ‘gurgling’ through my brain; I have had singing in my ears; I have been telepathic; I have been\ntelemetric; I have accessed the ‘Akashic Record’; I have ... the list goes on and on.\nThey all amount to nothing in the end – they are but physical, emotional, mental and psychic\nadumbrations that indicate merely that a ‘process’ is going on. It is important to not get hung up on these\nmanifestations and to go with what is happening to the very end.\nI see that I expanded upon this list in an e-mail to you last month:\n• [Richard]: ‘... I had many bizarre things happen such as electrical bolts of lightning dazzling on the\neyeballs; pressure-pains in the base of the neck; surges of power travelling up the spine and up over the\nback and the top of the head down to the forehead; convulsive twitching of limbs; energy surges from the\npit of the stomach up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity through to the throat producing\nintense nausea; a vivid blue light, an internal blue of rapturous bliss, behind the eyebrows; an all-knowing\ncyclopean eye in the sky watching my every move and many, many other weird things – none of which are\nimportant in themselves (some people get caught up in them, and manifest psychic powers, thus never\nproceeding to the final goal) as what is important is to take them only as a sign that a process is underway\nand thus proceed with all dispatch via one’s active consent.\n- http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listafcorrespondence/listaf60.htm”\n“[10:16 AM, 6/29/2020] John Tan: Frank is very experiential, no need to be too theoretical into emptiness,\nnon-arisen of phenomena for now.\n1239\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nRather it is to allow him to move the energy and radiance to his body...entire body...although the\nbackground is gone, you may think that all six senses are in equal radiance but it is far from truth in real\ntime and causes all the energy imbalances.\nRelax into the natural state and feel the energetic radiance over the entire body. Not by way of thinking.\nTouch anything, touch the toes, they legs, feel them. It is your mind...lol...can you understand that?\n[10:23 AM, 6/29/2020] John Tan: The mountain is mind, the grasses are mind, everything is mind. That is\nthrough the vision and mental, feel the body, toes fingers, touch them. They are mind. So do you\nunderstand that in real time?\nAs for sleep don't worry too much, it will happen and use less thoughts, let whole body be a sense of touch\nnot by thinking, but feel and touch it. So don't think that when insight of all is mind anatta arise, means\nyou are already into all is mind. If you can't embrace and feel all as mind, how are you to eliminate the\ncommon denominator called mind and into no mind which is the natural state of anatta.”\n“(To someone experiencing insomnia that lasted a week after realizing anatta:) Did you overfocus on the\nradiance in the day? Is your luminosity too intense and do you experience energy surges? You should learn\nyoga and do vase breathing and circulate your energies. If you are experiencing an energy imbalance, stop\nthinking about anything for now, even anatta, awareness, emptiness, etc. Just relax and let go. Don't focus\non radiance for now. Be more human. Be mindful of energy being stuck in crown and third eye area. And\nan unconscious tendency to focus on the third eye. Bring your energy to the lower body with abdominal\nbreathing and then to the ground. If after the realisation of anatta one has the misunderstanding that you\nhave to focus to experience more, that will strain your subtle body and nervous system and create an\nimbalance. Release the overfocused pattern of radiance. Also after energy imbalance is solved, maybe look\nmore into the first stanza and Phagguna Sutta -\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2012/09/phagguna-sutta-to-phagguna_22.html\nIt is important to be wide open, dissolve and relax into openness..

Natural and\neffortless. So don’t think you need to concentrate hard to achieve breakthrough\nFor example in breathing there is just the breath.. in hearing there is only sound.

Even though this indeed is the meditation practice, it is still imperfect in the\nsense of disliking a natural, free and wide-open presence of mind and, instead, preferring to focus\nexcessively in an unrelaxed way.\nIt is, therefore, extremely important not to be confused about the flawed ways of meditation practice.\nThe imperfect ways of training still have the possibility of progress, but they are awkward to sustain and so\ninvolve the risk of wearying of practice. Through various ways of focusing and relaxing in all instances -\nperceiving or being empty, thinking or being calm - you must thor- oughly investigate and recognize, so as\nto find a comfort- able way to sustain it.”\nYou can get that book for $2 at https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/05/mahamudra-books-for-\ncheap.html\nMahamudra Books for Cheap\nOverfocusing on the luminosity of the details of the world can lead to overstraining the nervous system.

Without this capacity it will be\nimpossible for you to feel loving kindness and compassion towards others, and to love them. We have to\nreconnect with our basic nature and relax in that. There is also a special yogic breathing exercise called\n“vase breathing,” which can serve us well here. The breath is closely connected to the subtle wind energy.\nIn my book, Open Heart, Open Mind, I devote a whole chapter to this method.\nQ: It is interesting that you mention yogic breathing. Is it worthwhile to practice yoga, chi gong and\npranayama in order to be more grounded in meditation? In traditional Tibetan Buddhist teachings, it is\nmy understanding that instructions on breathing exercises are normally not given.\nRinpoche: Yoga, chi-gong and similar energy-balancing can be extremely helpful in cases of disturbed lung.\nWhen there is an imbalance the subtle drops (Tib. “tigle”) are not able to circulate freely in the central\nchannel. This leads to blockages, not on the mental level or in the physical body, but the feeling energy is\nblocked. In these cases these kinds of exercises can be beneficial to restore a more natural balance. I think\nthat many older Tibetan lamas are not aware of the fact that establishing this equilibrium in the subtle body\nis so crucial in the West. Traditionally, in Tibetan Buddhism the methods you mentioned in your question\nare hardly used in relation to the body. That is why they are simply not considered by many teachers, and\nthey do not know much about them. It is also connected with the fact that in Tibetan society, that the\nemotional body was generally very stable and that there was more of an emphasis on healing the physical\nbody, such as with the neck or with joints and so on.” - Tsoknyi Rinpoche,\nhttps://tsoknyirinpoche.org/8877/tsoknyi-rinpoche-interview-lung/\n“A phenomena generally relating to the winds combining are the outer signs pertaining to the appearance\nof the clear light. This usually occurs prematurely. If complete ego-death isn't already achieved, it will begin\nsimultaneously as the body begins it's purification. Specifically the outer signs are disturbances and\ndisorders caused by the installation process of the clear-light. Subtle & habitual prana mis-patterning is due\nto an energetic echo of ego. Even if one has extinguished ego, this energetic-pranic echo can still be. This\nwill be also ceased by the time the actual-clear light dawns; the actual clear-light is entirely different then\nthis early dawning clear-light. The clear-light installation coalescing with with the energetic mis-patterning\ncauses friction (disorders etc).\nIncluding (one or many symptoms may arise, depending on various factors including the rate of evolution\npertaining to any one specific yogi):\nVarious sharp and/or random pains can happen throughout the body and in specific or all the channels.\nHeat and cold disorders like hot flashes and temperature oscillations. Bloating, swelling, and sores. Illness\nand pure appearance of illness may arise; the appearances will not generally respond to medications\nproperly. Joint pain, gout, and other arthritic symptoms.

There is/was\nthe intense actualization of the previous realization (I've had this realization of anatta for 8+ years with\nvarying degrees or intensity in experience since then) of the radiance that is none other than the textures\nand details of infinite world (which makes the world a paradisiacal wonderland of incredible aliveness and\nin that sense resembles a constant trip on a psychedelic drug like LSD despite being completely sober, the\ncolors literally look brighter and deeper, the scents and sounds and tactile sensations all becomes\nintensified and experienced differently - it felt like my brain, body and state of consciousness underwent a\nform of mutation and transformation) and there is/was an ongoing surge of super-active energy-sensation\nrunning through the body (which has by now mellowed a little but not completely gone and I feel this is\nwhat makes me more awake and energized in the day), and the state of consciousness was/is so incredibly\nintense and blissful.\nHowever, at one point an energy imbalance developed (and I think it was partly due to my wrong way of\npracticing, my overfocusing on the details of the world in PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) created a\nrather tense energy), a stuck energy in the head and third eye chakra that caused headaches, affected my\nstate of consciousness and thought process (I can hardly focus on work during that time, I was just lucky I\ndidn’t have a very busy schedule at work back then), made me barely able to work and function and\nsleepless (at the peak of the imbalance at least for one day I could not sleep at all - my body laid on the bed\nwhile the mind was awake) and then on the last day I actually spent half an hour in the office toilet to calm\nmy energies with the nausea which was hard to bear and on that day I entered a half-awake trance like\nstate and had flashes of figures (like two brief one-second flashes of hallucination - one of a witch-looking\nwoman wearing black and one of an alien-looking man with big eyes) and on a separate occasion (not tied\nto or caused by the hallucination - the brief flashes of images caused no fear in me) a brief one second flash\nof bodily sensations that seemed like fear caused by (or rather, is none other than a brief outburst of) the\nagitation of stuck energy but without any mental story or emotional content. I intuitively stood up and\nwalked around, as soon as I stood up it subsided. But nonetheless it did cast doubt on my having overcome\nfear, but a further insight some days later seemed to do further damage to the sense of self involved in\nfear. Also, during that day I entered the world of sound where music took on a new depth while relaxing\nwith music, but I quickly snapped out of it as I knew any focusing on sound will agitate my energies further.\nAfter these unpleasant experiences I thought to myself that I needed my family members to drive me home\nfrom work that day as I did not think it will be safe for me to operate a vehicle with my condition then.\n1247\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nFortunately by 5pm+ the tense energy in my head and chest suddenly lifted and my mind went back to\nnormal. It has been solved since then (it’s been about 2~3 weeks already), no more headaches, stuck and\ntense energy, trouble falling asleep, brain fog, etc. I was very wary of consuming caffeine (I avoided all coffee,\ntea, and chocolates) then as even a cup of tea was able to trigger another episode of a shift of consciousness\nand energy that sort of resembles the over-excited energy even about 1~2 weeks ago, but by now I am able\nto enjoy a cup of coffee without too much issues.\nI was reminded of Richard’s 2 years period of mental agony and ‘brain excitation’ and U.G. Krishnamurti’s\n‘calamity’ that he said was a mental torture which lasted 3 years. (Update: I have later found out that J\nKrishnamurti had experienced similar tortures for a decade or more. Also see his book Krishnamurti’s\nNotebook) Fortunately that only lasted like a week or so and I am so glad to have solved that rather quickly\n(instead of years) with the advise of Thusness who seems to have gone through all these, he basically taught\nme to relax, completely stop any thinking or contemplating (including but not limited to any issues\npertaining to self/no-self/actual/radiance/universe/etc) as it has been my experience too that any thinking\nsimply agitates my energies further at that point, stop focusing in a contrived manner, stop focusing on\nradiance and simply concentrate on somatic practice and rooting to the earth, bringing the energy into the\nabdomen and ground. That helped. (For a somewhat related energy practice, see\nhttps://buddhismnow.com/2015/09/12/zen-sickness-by-zen-master-hakuin/) John Tan had also informed\nme that the energy imbalance could have been far worse had I not nipped it in the bud.\nNow all the good things remain without the energy imbalance stuff, like the full glory of PCE (Pure\nConsciousness Experience) and the infinitude of the universe (without any need for focusing or effort - the\ncenterless, boundlessness and infinitude of the universe is simply spontaneously present and living this\n'flesh and blood body') where the field of consciousness is very naturally, unconstricted by the sense of a\ncenter, the vast infinite expanse (centerless, boundless) of the universe without the slightest trace of\nself/Self in which this body and everybody and everything is the expression of/with, a total exertion with\nthe whole universe, including lessened sleep (right after I overcome the energy imbalance: 4-5 hours, now\n[2 to 3 weeks later] 5-6 hours, but in the past I can sleep anywhere from 7 to 10 hours plus naps in the\nafternoon if I'm free) but have no trouble falling asleep at all, and I feel much more energised with that\nlessened amount of sleep than when I was waking up with the help of alarm clocks with 7 hours of sleep\neveryday back then. John Tan (Thusness) himself sleeps only 4 to 5 hours everyday and has told me 10+\nyears ago that at some point my sleep will lessen and I will undergo a bodily transformation and become\nbeaming with clarity and energy (the details of what he described was identical to what I have underwent\nrecently), and recently he said he has been expecting that I would experience what I've been experiencing\nrecently but I was behind his expected schedule by 2 years. I see the lessened need for sleep as a positive\ndevelopment for me, as that means I have more time to spend on other things...\" - Soh, 2019\n“Regarding the difficult part I was experiencing back then – it didn’t affect the PCE-mode. In other words,\nthe world was still intensely vivid, like the colors, scent, sounds, take on a new depth, but it felt like it\nhappened because I was too awed by it in some sense, and was straining unnaturally to experience as\n1248\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nmuch as I can, plus with the heightening and intensifying of energy due to that shift it then created a kind\nof head tension, headache, stuck energy, and all the other health problems I mentioned gradually\ndeveloped, like a sore throat that later developed into other stuff like nausea and diarrhea, intuitively I felt\nlike it was all linked to my energy imbalance plus I didn’t eat out so I knew it wasn’t food poisoning, I just\nate light oatmeals and stuff as I didn’t have appetite at all. Thusness informed me my health issues was due\nto “Over concentrated and focus will upset your body balance. However once it affects your body this way\nbetter to get medical help, you won't be able to release yourself this way… …Energy is trapped and causes\nall your body to function improperly because the body doesn't know how to release itself from tension.\nShake your hands and bodies let your body feel the release.”, and later I found a video by Tsoknyi Rinpoche\nwhich described a similar kind energy imbalance I went through and said it will cause digestive issues -\nhttps://youtu.be/ZcB6iUsj25s (Subtle Body 07 (Lung is Home)). Thusness who seemed to have gone through\nall these before told me it was due to the ‘overfocused pattern of radiance’ which I agreed, and told me to\nrelax so that I feel ‘light as a feather but immense as the universe’. And even while the headaches and other\ndifficulties occurred, the PCE-mode is still there, not diminished at all, yet I’m experiencing all the bodily\ndiscomforts and sleeplessness. In other words, the world seemed perfect even then, and yet, there’s really\nbad physical discomfort at some point. After that was solved, the PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience)\nmode remained but without the tenseness and I started to experience the infinitude of the universe more\nand more.” - Soh, 2019\n“During the height of the energy imbalance episode, while relaxing with music I entered the world of sound\nwhere music took on a new depth and intensity like I never experienced before, but I quickly snapped out\nof it as I didn’t want to agitate my energies further. John Tan informed me not to focus on non-dual radiance\nfor the next two weeks during the period of energy imbalance, and purely focus on experiencing no-self in\nthe somatic practices and in compassion, but not radiance.\nHis advice then:\n‘Don't think too much. Just keep focusing on somatic and bodily release. Another good way is to practice\nanatta on compassion for others... Not on the radiance. That is the only two thing you should focus now. If\nyou can't go yoga you can just practice shaking your hand and body and relax... Feel the vibrating sensation\nof the blood flow of your body’” - Soh, 2019\nNick: “What Somatic Practices or therapies have you tried and would recommend?\nPersonally I'm interested in anything that could help with chronic tightness and pain and not being able to\n\"let go\". The holding is very strong in me. Im currently seeing a biodynamic-psychotherapist which is a\nsomatic/energy therapy based on the Reichian method and it's certainly having some effect but I'm only\n2months or so into it so early days yet. It would be good to hear about other therapies folks here have\ntried as well as free stuff you can learn to do by yourself at home ”\nTyler Jones: “Skeletal shaking / shaking qigong”\n1249\nTips on Energy Imbalances\n“There is so much wisdom from John here, matches what my Daoism teacher says perfectly. The energy\ngets stuck in a pattern and so is hard to fix yourself - because going inside automatically triggers that\nsame pattern. Shaking is good. Physical exercise is good. Self massage is good - create physical\nsensations, use the hands not the awareness to move energy. Warm water is good - gets the energy\nmoving outward. Compassion / service to others is good - gets the energy moving outward on a more\nsubtle level. Not thinking is good - certainly not trying to analyze physical sensations in the way some\nDharma teachers advise.”\n“John Tan and my mom (who also had many energetic experiences) both advised me in the same manner\n- bring my energy to the earth, rub my hands and feet. John Tan also told me to practice abdominal\nbreathing.\nOn the last day of my energy imbalance - about one week into it, which was also the most intense, John Tan\ntold me to pray sincerely to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and I told him I did. I have prayed to the\nBuddhas and Bodhisattvas just the night before when I could not sleep at all, and wished for a speedy\nrecovery and for my experience to be of a beneficial lesson to others so that others may overcome this\nproblem quickly in future or be free of such agony.\nLater on, John Tan revealed to me how much he suffered in the past due to energy imbalances which began\nsome time after his realization of I AMness. I shall not divulge the details, but I think he suffered even more\nthan Zen Master Hakuin’s ‘post-satori Zen sickness’, AF Richard’s 2 years of ‘mental agony’ and ‘neuronal\nexcitation’, as well as U.G Krishnamurti’s three years of ‘torturous calamity’. I do not want to scare anyone\nreading this but I think people deserve to know that these things do happen, and they deserve to know\nhow to navigate these challenging terrains. I must say I feel very fortunate to have overcome it in 7 days. It\nis easier to overcome while the problem has not yet become aggravated out of control. Only now did it\nmake sense to me when John Tan said in the past that contrary to what people think, one can suffer even\nmore after the realization of I AMness (I AMness on the other hand was a blissful period for me, as John\nTan guided me to avoid practicing the wrong way -- i.e. by not focusing practice wrongly based on the stated\npitfalls and focusing on the four aspects of I AM). He only partially overcome those problems after the\nrealization of anatta, but warned that even too intense PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) mode of\nperception can also cause a problem (as what happened to AF Richard and UGK and my 7 day energy\nimbalance episode).\nTo avoid these issues, learn the right way of breathing and somatic practices. You do not have to worry at\nall if you practice accordingly. To avoid these problems, John Tan suggests,\n‘You must understand your body, know how breathing affects your energy and diet. Ironically, effects are\nonly apparent when you have energy imbalance, then you are able to experience the release otherwise you\nwill just feel it is normal.’\n1250\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nI also had a tendency to open my eyes wide due to intensified clarity and like to marvel at the wonderful\nsceneries with eyes wide open, but John Tan told me not to open my eyes widely lest I trigger another\nenergy imbalance episode, and be more human instead. I also mentioned to him that, like U.G.\nKrishnamurti, I hardly blink my eyes anymore and is always in the zone, and John Tan simply replied that\nnot blinking should not be taken as a sign of enlightenment and that it is important to circulate one’s energy.\n(Focusing too much on the intense clarity of vision will lead to energy stagnation)\n“You must experience the intensity of vividness but not fabricate intensity.” - John Tan, 2019\nWhen I posted my condition on the Awakening to Reality facebook group, someone suggested that I am\nexperiencing Zen sickness. Upon reading the descriptions in Quora and the text by Zen Master Hakuin, I\ncan confirm that the symptoms are similar and the advice by Zen Master Hakuin is great and helpful.\nAnother way to prepare the body for “zen sickness” is to practice yoga, which I recommend all able-bodied\npersons to practice. As John Tan wrote, “...your body is already prone to inflammation. And still further\nupset by imbalance. So once your radiance and clarity gets strong, don't intensify but instead balance it\nwith practices like yoga to bring energy into circulation throughout your body. You can manage it with\nasanas to open various parts of your body. Now if you have wisdom you can realize by your own. If your\nwisdom and mindfulness isn't strong, you need a teacher to point it out to you. Excessive intake of caffeine,\nis the same of over intensifying vividness… ...Balance your body circulation. I have already try to prevent\nyou from having issues by telling you to go into yoga few years ago.” (Comment about caffeine: caffeine\nhas triggered a mini rerun of an energy imbalance/intensification episodes twice for Soh, so he is cutting\ndown for now)\n[25/3/19, 11:44:55 AM] Soh Wei Yu: My concentration at work is definitely affected.. lol\n[25/3/19, 11:49:27 AM] John Tan: Affected by?\n[25/3/19, 11:50:41 AM] Soh Wei Yu: I dunno.. the intense energetic presence maybe\n[25/3/19, 11:50:52 AM] Soh Wei Yu: But I Guess I will get used to it after a while\n[25/3/19, 11:52:39 AM] Soh Wei Yu: Actually I think it’s affecting my thought process lol.. nvm\n[25/3/19, 11:55:40 AM] John Tan: No good\n[25/3/19, 12:00:34 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Any suggestion\n[25/3/19, 12:00:35 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Lol\n[25/3/19, 12:00:40 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Maybe I need to meditate more\n[25/3/19, 12:00:52 PM] John Tan: Don't do anything\n[25/3/19, 12:00:57 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Ok\n[25/3/19, 12:01:06 PM] John Tan: Dont think of radiance\n[25/3/19, 12:01:12 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Ok\n[25/3/19, 12:01:33 PM] John Tan: Breathe with your stomach\n[25/3/19, 12:01:37 PM] John Tan: Abdominal\n[25/3/19, 12:01:48 PM] John Tan: you must feel how you relax down\n[25/3/19, 12:02:19 PM] John Tan: Ur energy clogging at the brow center is no good\n[25/3/19, 12:02:38 PM] John Tan: Be rooted to earth element\n[25/3/19, 12:02:42 PM] Soh Wei Yu: How you know, from my description?\n1251\nTips on Energy Imbalances\n[25/3/19, 12:02:47 PM] John Tan: Usual\n[25/3/19, 12:02:51 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Where is brow center\n[25/3/19, 12:03:07 PM] John Tan: In between your eye brow\n[25/3/19, 12:03:11 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[25/3/19, 12:03:15 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Yesterday Angelo told me\n[25/3/19, 12:03:32 PM] John Tan: Relax and be rooted to earth element\n[25/3/19, 12:03:36 PM] Soh Wei Yu: That’s interesting.

Take care my friend.\nThis may or may not be helpful at all but I’ve done this and told people about it many times who have\nvery intense energetic movements. That is the energy release is trying to move to ground. If you think in\nterms of physical matter (very densely packed energy) the earth is by far the largest ground available. So\nthe energy wants to move toward ground.\n[25/3/19, 12:03:44 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Adyashanti taught me this. It’s odd sounding but it works. Imagine you\nare looking at a beautiful horse in a pasture and the sun is setting behind it. You can just trace the light\nover its shoulders and back. It’s perfectly smooth. Now you run your hand slowly down the horses main\nand over its back feeling the smoothness and light as your hand runs over slowly. In the same ways you\nfeel the energy moving slowly down from your head through your body and into the Earth. I have no idea\nbut I’ve done it many times and it works for me when a ton of energy being released.\nAlso I tell people lay on the earth and invite the earth to regulate the energy in your body at the level of\nheart.

But from the point of view of\nsomeone with a lot of psychological suffering they might think “why in the world would I add all that pain\nto my experience, no thanks.” But that’s a skewed view before awakening.\nFor me there were years of headaches.

method\nbelow. Even if you do not have energy imbalances, there are many benefits to practicing it, so it is\nimportant.\nHave you ever experienced \"zen sickness\" and what was it like?\nSid Kemp, Zen practioner since 1980, sharing Buddhist meditation since 1987.\nAnswered Apr 8, 2017\nWhat is Zen Sickness?\nZen Sickness is a term that comes specifically from the personal journals of Zen Master Hakuin. It is a very\nreal and unique phenomenon. From both study of the literature and also personal experience, I must\ndisagree with all the other answers here.\nZen Sickness is a side effect that comes with dai kensho, great Awakening, also called satori. This is the\ndeepest experience of mind, though not the highest attainment, in the Zen path, particularly as seen by the\nRinzai school of Zen in Japan, of which Hakuin was a great teacher.\nDai kensho is an Awakening Event (more often, but more inaccurately, called an enlightenment experience)\nthat lasts for two months or more. It leads to great insight and stability of mind.\nZen Sickness is a side effect of dai kensho, and of the years of meditative effort to get there. It is an\nimbalance of chi (or qi), vital life energy. It arises because in zazen, Zen sitting, one is perpetually straining\nupward without realizing it. When the energy finally breaks through, there is a perpetual excess of Heavenly\nchi. The body is lethargic. Vital energy appears low. All medical remedies fail. As one tries them, symptoms\nperpetually shift. All diagnosis fails and relief is nowhere in sight.\nFortunately, there actually is a simple remedy. There are some qi gong (chi gong) meditations that resolve\nthe difficulty quite quickly. Hakuin learned them from a mountain hermit and wrote them in his journals. I\nhave learned them and used them and shared them with my students.\n1257\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nThere is one useful description of Zen sickness from yoga master B. K. S. Iyengar. A Zen student\nexperiencing Zen sickness came to him. He explained that, if one does deep zazen without relaxing the\nbody and preparing it through yoga, the body can become very ill. Speaking of the energy that comes in\nand creates the imbalance, he said, “You have brought these lightnings down upon yourself.” The student\nwas able to heal herself with Iyengar yoga. The yoga solution does work, but it is more painful than the qi\ngong solution. Most often, a blend of qi gong and yoga together is most useful.\nHow I work with Zen sickness\nYou also ask the personal question, “Have you ever experienced Zen sickness?” This question makes sense\nto ask, but it cannot be answered on a public forum. To declare “I have had Zen sickness” implies “dai kensho\nhas happened to this one.” To say that in a public forum is an expression of ego attachment. Such matters\nare discussed privately between Zen practitioners.\nI will say that the remedy for Zen sickness is also a preventative, and is also useful as part of a remedy for\nother physiological and psychospiritual imbalances that arise in sensitive people and during intensive\nmeditation. I share the remedy with students.

I embarked\non a regimen of rigorous austerities, which I continued for several years, pushing myself relentlessly.\nThen one night, everything suddenly fell away, and I crossed the threshold into enlightenment. All the\ndoubts and uncertaint ies that had burdened me all those years suddenly vanished, roots and all—just like\nmelted ice. Deep-rooted karma that had bound me for endless kalpas to the cycle of birth-and-death\nvanished like foam on the water.\nIt’s true, I thought to myself: the Way is not far from man. Those stories about the ancient masters taking\ntwenty or even thirty years to attain it—someone must have made them all up. For the next several months,\nI was waltzing on air, flagging my arms and stamping my feet in a kind of witless rapture.\nAfterwards, however, as I began reflecting upon my everyday behaviour, I could see that the two aspects\nof my life—the active and the meditative—were totally out of balance. No matter what I was doing, I never\nfelt free or completely at ease. I realised I would have to rekindle a fearless resolve and once again throw\nmyself life and limb together into the Dharma struggle. With my teeth clenched tightly and eyes focused\nstraight ahead, I began devoting myself single-mindedly to my practice, forsaking food and sleep altogether.\n1259\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nBefore the month was out, my heart fire began to rise up ward against the natural course, parching my\nlungs of their essen tial fluids.[1] My feet and legs were always ice-cold: they felt as though they were\nimmersed in tubs of snow. There was a constant buzzing in my ears, as if I were walking beside a raging\nmountain torrent. I became abnormally weak and timid, shrinking and fear ful in whatever I did. I felt totally\ndrained, physically and mentally exhausted. Strange visions appeared to me during waking and sleeping\nhours alike. My armpits were always wet with perspira tion. My eyes watered constantly. I travelled far and\nwide, visiting wise Zen teachers, seeking out noted physicians. But none of the remedies they offered\nbrought me any relief.\nMaster Hakuyu\nThen I happened to meet someone who told me about a hermit named Master Hakuyu, who lived inside a\ncave high in the mountains of the Shirakawa District of Kyoto. He was reputed to be three hundred and\nseventy years old. His cave dwelling was two or three leagues from any human habitation. He didn’t like\nseeing people, and whenever someone approached, he would run off and hide. From the look of him, it\nwas hard to tell whether he was a man of great wisdom or merely a fool, but the people in the surrounding\nvillages venerated him as a sage. Rumour had it he had been the teacher of Ishikawa Jozan [2] and that he\nwas well versed in astrology and deeply learned in the medical arts as well. People who had approached\nhim and requested his teaching in the proper manner, observing the proprieties, had on rare occa sions\nbeen known to elicit a remark or two of enigmatic import from him. After leaving and giving the words\ndeeper thought, the people would generally discover them to be very beneficial.\nIn the middle of the first month in the seventh year of the Hoei era [1710], I shouldered my travel pack,\nslipped quietly out of the temple in eastern Mino where I was staying, and headed for Kyoto. On reaching\nthe capital, I bent my steps northward, crossing over the hills at Black Valley [Kurodani] and making my way\nto the small hamlet at White River [Shirakawa]. I dropped my pack off at a teahouse and went to make\ninquiries about Mas­ter Hakuyu’s cave. One of the villagers pointed his finger toward a thin thread of\nrushing water high above in the hills.\nUsing the sound of the water as my guide, I struck up into the mountains, hiking on until I came to the\nstream. I made my way along the bank for another league or so until the stream and the trail both petered\nout. There was not so much as a woodcut­ters’ trail to indicate the way. At this point, I lost my bearings\ncompletely and was unable to proceed another step. Not knowing what else to do, I sat down on a nearby\nrock, closed my eyes, placed my palms before me in gassho, and began chanting a sutra. Presently, as if by\nmagic, I heard in the distance the faint sounds of someone chopping at a tree. After pushing my way deeper\nthrough the forest trees in the direction of the sound, I spotted a woodcutter. He directed my gaze far\n1260\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nabove to a distant site among the swirling clouds and mist at the crest of the mountains. I could just make\nout a small yellowish patch, not more than an inch square, appearing and disappearing in the eddying\nmountain vapours. He told me it was a rushwork blind that hung over the entrance to Master Hakuyu’s\ncave. Hitching the bottom of my robe up into my sash, I began the final ascent to Hakuyu’s dwell­ing.\nClambering over jagged rocks, pushing through heavy vines and clinging underbrush, the snow and frost\ngnawed into my straw sandals, the damp clouds thrust against my robe. It was very hard going, and by the\ntime I reached the spot where I had seen the blind, I was covered with a thick, oily sweat.\nI now stood at the entrance to the cave. It commanded a prospect of unsurpassed beauty, completely above\nthe vulgar dust of the world. My heart trembling with fear, my skin prickling with gooseflesh, I leaned against\nsome rocks for a while and counted out several hundred breaths.\nAfter shaking off the dirt and dust and straightening my robe to make myself presentable, I bowed down,\nhesitantly pushed the blind aside, and peered into the cave. I could make out the figure of Master Hakuyu\nin the darkness. He was sitting perfectly erect, his eyes shut. A wonderful head of black hair flecked with\nbits of white reached down over his knees. He had a fine, youthful complexion, ruddy in hue like a Chinese\ndate. He was seated on a soft mat made of grasses and wore a large jacket of coarsely woven cloth. The\ninterior of the cave was small, not more than five feet square, and, except for a small desk, there was no\nsign of household articles or other furnishings of any kind. On top of the desk, I could see three scrolls of\nwriting—The Doctrine of the Mean, Lao Tzu, and the Diamond Sutra.[3]\nI introduced myself as politely as I could, explained the symptoms and causes of my illness in some detail,\nand appealed to the master for his help.\nCure\nAfter a while, Hakuyu opened his eyes and gave me a good hard look. Then, speaking slowly and\ndeliberately, he explained that he was only a useless, worn-out old man—”more dead than alive.” He\ndwelled among these mountains living on such nuts and wild mountain fruit as he could gather. He passed\nthe nights together with the mountain deer and other wild creatures. He professed to be completely\nignorant of anything else and said he was acutely embarrassed that such an important Buddhist priest had\nmade a long trip expressly to see him.\nBut I persisted, begging repeatedly for his help. At last, he reached out with an easy, almost offhand gesture\nand grasped my hand. He proceeded to examine my five bodily organs, taking my pulses at nine vital points.\nHis fingernails, I noticed, were almost an inch long.\n1261\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nFurrowing his brow, he said with a voice tinged with pity, “Not much can be done. You have developed a\nserious illness. By pushing yourself too hard, you forgot the cardinal rule of religious training. You are\nsuffering from meditation sickness, which is extremely difficult to cure by medical means. If you attempt to\ntreat it by using acupuncture, moxacautery, or medicines, you will find they have no effect—not even if they\nwere administered by a P’ien Ch’iao, Ts’ang Kung, or Hua T’o.[4] You came to this grievous pass as a result\nof meditation. You will never regain your health unless you are able to master the techniques of\nIntrospective Meditation. Just as the old saying goes, ‘When a person falls to the earth, it is from the earth\nthat he must raise himself up.’”\n“Please,” I said, “teach me the secret technique of Introspec­tive Meditation. I want to begin practising it,\nand learn how it’s done.”\nWith a demeanour that was now solemn and majestic, Master Hakuyu softly and quietly replied, “Ah, you\nare determined to find an answer to your problem, aren’t you, young man? All right, I suppose I can tell you\na few things about Introspective Medita tion that I learned many years ago. It is a secret method for\nsus taining life known to very few people. Practised diligently, it is sure to yield remarkable results. It will\nenable you to look forward to a long life as well.”\n“What you must do is to cut back on words and devote yourself solely to sustaining your primal energy.[5]\nHence, it is said, “Those who wish to strengthen their sight keep their eyes closed. Those who wish to\nstrengthen their hearing avoid sounds. Those who wish to sustain their heart-energy maintain silence.”\nThe Soft-Butter Method\n“You [Hakuin] mentioned a method in which butter is used,” I said. “May I ask you about that?”\nMaster Hakuyu replied, “When a student engaged in medi­tation finds that he is exhausted in body and\nmind because the four constituent elements of his body are in a state of disharmony, he should gird up his\nspirit and perform the following visualisation:\nImagine that a lump of soft butter, pure in colour and fra grance and the size and shape of a duck egg, is\nsuddenly placed on the top of your head. As it begins to slowly melt, it imparts an exquisite sensation,\nmoistening and saturating your head within and without. It continues to ooze down, moistening your\nshoul ders, elbows, and chest; permeating lungs, diaphragm, liver, stomach, and bowels; moving down the\nspine through the hips, pelvis, and buttocks.\n“At that point, all the congestions that have accumulated within the five organs and six viscera, all the aches\nand pains in the abdomen and other affected parts, will follow the heart as it sinks downward into the lower\n1262\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nbody. As it does, you will dis tinctly hear a sound like that of water trickling from a higher to a lower place.\nIt will move lower down through the lower body, suffusing the legs with beneficial warmth, until it reaches\nthe soles of the feet, where it stops.\n“The student should then repeat the contemplation. As his vital energy flows downward, it gradually fills\nthe lower region of the body, suffusing it with penetrating warmth, making him feel as if he were sitting up\nto his navel in a hot bath filled with a decoction of rare and fragrant medicinal herbs that have been\ngathered and infused by a skilled physician.\n“Inasmuch as all things are created by the mind, when you engage in this contemplation, the nose will\nactually smell the marvellous scent of pure, soft butter; your body will feel the exqui site sensation of its\nmelting touch. Your body and mind will be in perfect peace and harmony. You will feel better and enjoy\ngreater health than you did as a youth of twenty or thirty. At this time, all the undesirable accumulations in\nyour vital organs and viscera will melt away. Stomach and bowels will function perfectly. Be fore you know\nit, your skin will glow with health. If you continue to practise the contemplation with diligence, there is no\nillness that cannot be cured, no virtue that cannot be acquired, no level of sagehood that cannot be reached,\nno religious practice that cannot be mastered. Whether such results appear swiftly or slowly depends only\nupon how scrupulously you apply yourself.\n“I was a sickly youth, in much worse shape than you are now. I experienced ten times the suffering you\nhave endured. The doctors finally gave up on me. I explored hundreds of cures on my own, but none of\nthem brought me any relief. I turned to the gods for help. Prayed to the deities of both heaven and earth,\nbegging them for their subtle, imperceptible assistance. I was marvellously blessed. They extended me their\nsupport and protec tion. I came upon this wonderful method of soft-butter contem plation. My joy knew\nno bounds. I immediately set about practising it with total and single-minded determination. Before even\na month was out, my troubles had almost totally vanished. Since that time, I’ve never been the least bit\nbothered by any complaint, physical or mental.\n“I became like an ignoramus, mindless and utterly free of care. I was oblivious to the passage of time. I\nnever knew what day or month it was, even whether it was a leap year or not. I gradually lost interest in the\nthings the world holds dear, soon forgot completely about the hopes and desires and customs of ordinary\nmen and women. In my middle years, I was compelled by circumstance to leave Kyoto and take refuge in\nthe mountains of Wakasa Province. I lived there nearly thirty years, unknown to my fellow men. Looking\nback on that period of my life, it seems as fleeting and unreal as the dream-life that flashed through Lu-\nsheng’s slumbering brain.[6]\n1263\nTips on Energy Imbalances\n“Now I live here in this solitary spot in the hills of Shira­kawa, far from all human habitation. I have a layer\nor two of clothing to wrap around my withered old carcass. But even in midwinter, on nights when the cold\nbites through the thin cotton, I don’t freeze. Even during the months when there are no moun tain fruits or\nnuts for me to gather, and I have no grain to eat, I don’t starve. It is all thanks to this contemplation.\n“Young man, you have just learned a secret that you could not use up in a whole lifetime. What more could\nI teach you?”\nNotes:\n1. This was a basic notion in Chinese medical lore. Cf. the statement in the encyclopaedic compilation Wu\ntsa tsu (Five Assorted Offerings, the section on “Man”), by the Ming scholar Hsieh Chao-che: “When a person\nis engaged in too much intellection, the heart fire burns excessively and mounts upward.” Torei’s Biography\n(1710, Age 25) lists twelve morbid symptoms that appeared: firelike burning in the head; loins and legs ice-\ncold; eyes constantly watering; ringing in the ears; instinctive shrinking from sunlight; irrepressible sadness\nin darkness or shade; thinking an intolerable burden; recurrent bad dreams sapping his strength; emission\nof semen during sleep; restlessness and nervousness during waking hours; difficulty digesting food; cold\nchills unrelieved by heavy clothing.\n2. The samurai Ishikawa Jozan (1583-1672) retired to the hills northeast of Kyoto in 1641. His residence, the\nShisendo (Hall of Poetry Immortals), is located on a hillside overlooking the northern part of Kyoto. See\nThomas Rimer, Shisendo (New York: Weatherhill, 1991). There are several caves Hakuyu is said to have\ninhabited located in the hills behind the Shisendo.\n3. The three books are intended to show Hakuyu’s roots in the three traditions: Confucianism, Taoism, and\nBuddhism.\n4. P’ien Ch’iao, Ts’ang Kung, and Hua T’o are three celebrated physicians of ancient China.\n5. Vital energy translates the term ki (Chinese, ch’i), a key concept in traditional Chinese thought and medical\ntheory. It has been rendered into English in various ways—for example, vital energy, primal energy, breath,\nvital breath, spirit. Ki-energy, circulating through the human body, is vital to the preservation of health and\nsustenance of life and plays a prominent part in the methods of Introspective Meditation that Hakuin\nlearned from Master Hakuyu. The “external” alchemy of the Taoist tradition involved the search for a “pill”\nor “elixir” of immortality, the most important element of which was a mercury compound (cinnabar). Once\nfound and taken into the body, it was supposed to assure immortality and ascent to heaven, commonly on\nthe back of a crane.\n1264\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nHakuyu’s instruction is concerned rather with the internal ramifications of this tradition, in which the “elixir”\nis cultivated in the area of the lower tanden, the “elixir field” or “cinnabar field,” also called the kikai tanden,\n“the ocean of ki-energy,” the centre of breathing or centre of strength, located slightly below the navel.\nHakuin describes the terms in Orategama: “Although the tanden is located in the three places in the body,\nthe one to which I refer is the lower tanden. The kikai and the tanden, which are virtually identical, are both\nlocated below the navel. The tanden is two inches below the navel, the kikai an inch and a half below it. It\nis in this area that the true ki-energy always accumulates.”\n6. A young man named Lu-sheng on his way to seek a career in the capital stopped off at a place called\nHan-tan. ‘While waiting for his lunch to cook, he took a nap and dreamed that he rose through the ranks\nand finally attained the post of prime minister. When he woke and saw his food still cooking on the fire, he\nrealised that life is an empty dream and returned to his home.\nExtracts from WILD IVY, The Spiritual Autobiography of Zen Master Hakuin, translated by Norman Waddell.\n© 1999 by Norman Waddell. Reprinted by arrangement with Shambhala Publications, Inc., Boston,\nwww.shambhala.com\nPublished in the November 2001 Buddhism Now.”\nI highly recommend the vase breathing practice which you can read up in “Open Mind, Open Heart” by\nTsoknyi Rinpoche. In that book, Tsoknyi Rinpoche also describes similar energy imbalances from personal\nexperience and how to deal with them.\nHere is an excerpt from “Open Mind, Open Heart”:\n“Vase Breathing\nOne of the methods that helped this woman and countles others cope with emotions is a practice that\nhelps us draw lung back to its center, or “home.” For this, we use a special breathing technique as a tool,\nbecause breath is a physical correlation to the subtle wind energy of lung.\nThis technique is called vase breathing, and it involves breathing even more deeply than the type of deep\ndiaphragmatic breathing often taught in many yoga and other types of classes with which people may be\nfamiliar.\nThe technique itself is rather simple. First, exhale slowly and completely, collapsing the abdominal muscles\nas close to the spine as possible. As you slowly breathe in, imagine that you’re drawing your breath down\nto an area about four finger widths below your navel, just above your pubic bone. This area is shaped a bit\nlike a vase, which is why the technique is called vase breathing. Of course, you’re not really drawing your\n1265\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nbreath down to that region, but by turning your attention there, you will find yourself inhaling a bit more\ndeeply than usual and will experience a bit more of an expansion in the vase region.\nAs you continue to draw your breath in and your attention down, your lung will gradually begin to travel\ndown there and begin to rest there. Hold your breath down in the vase region just for a few seconds - don’t\nwait until the need to exhale becomes urgent - then slowly breathe out again.\nJust breathe slowly this way three or four times, exhaling completely and inhaling down into the vase area.\nAfter the third or fourth inhalation, try holding a little bit of your breath - maybe 10 percent - in the vase\narea at the end of the exhalation, focusing very lightly and gently on maintaining a bit of lung in its home\nplace.\nTry it now.\nExhale completely and then breathe slowly and gently down to the vase area three or four times, and on\nthe last exhalation, hold a little bit of breath in the vase area. Keep this up for about ten minutes.\nHow did that feel?\nMaybe it was a little uncomfortable. Some people have said that directing their breath in this way is difficult.\nOthers have said that doing so gave them a sense of calmness and centeredness they’d never felt before.\nVase breathing, if practiced ten or even twenty minutes every day, can become a direct means of developing\nawareness of our feelings and learning how to work with them even while we’re engaged in our daily\nactivities. When our lung is centered in its home place, our bodies, or feelings, and our thoughts gradually\nfind a healthy balance. The horse and rider work together in a very loose and easy way, neither trying to\nseize control or drive the other crazy. In the process, we find that subtle body patterns associated with fear,\npain, anxiety, anger, restlessness, and so on gradually loosen up, that there’s a little bit of space between\nthe mind and the feelings.\nUltimately the goal is to be able to maintain that small bit of breath in the vase area throughout the day,\nduring all our activities - walking, talking, eating, drinking, driving. For some people, this ability becomes\nautomatic after only a short while of practice. For others, it may require a bit more time.\nI have to admit that, even after years of practicing, I still find that I sometimes lose my connection to my\nhome base, especially when meeting with people who are very speedy. I’m a bit of a speedy person myself,\nand meeting other speedy people acts as a kind of subtle body stimulus. I get caught up in their restless\nand displaced energy and consequently become a bit restless, nervous, and sometimes even anxious. So I\ntake what I call a reminder breath: exhaling completely, breathing down into the vase area, and then\nexhaling again leaving a little bit of breath in the lung’s home.”\n1266\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nJohn Tan advised someone experiencing anxiety and insomnia, “[1:05 PM, 12/18/2019] John Tan: Relaxation\nand letting go is probably the toughest art to master in life. The best way is to learn breathing exercise to\nrelax and focus on the pulsation of our palm… do not attempt to sleep if she can't sleep and don't worry\nabout it too much. She can replenish her lack of sleep through short naps. We just need about 2hrs of\ndeep sleep.”\nI also highly recommend watching this video as it teaches the correct posture in zazen and importance of\nabdominal breathing and the correlation with energy: https://youtu.be/LL2XUTeoUsM (Zen -\nIntroduction to zen practice / full version - Taigen Shodo Harada Roshi)\nYin Ling\nh15tmS1361ps7hrg8ecmgfh ·\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXnNbqK5oP4\nSelf massage technique for energy imbalance or blockages.\nSharing this. anyone who has ever face energy imbalances, and know how uncomfortable it is, will\nbenefit.\nI always have this problem ever since I started meditating.

However for opening and activating body awareness, just deeply feel and\nsense and the (thinking) mind will be naturally quiet.\n3. Mind has its language, mind has its memories, so does the body.\n1269\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nHence learn the language and memories of our body. If we expand our body awareness, we will realize\n\"body\" is also \"mind\"; merely conceptually distinct but lack difference or sameness ultimately.\n4. As a layman practitioner, don't use your mind to direct your qi or prana. That is a wrong approach. It will\ntake 10 years of dedicate visualization in meditation to have a small success to use your mind to release\nyour body blockages, but will take 10 mins for the body to do that. Use the right approach.\n5. In addition to Meido Moore Roshi Do-In Ho practice, massage both ears by pulling them from the top of\near to the bottom 20 times. Then relax and feel the vibrating sensations.\n6. Do half lotus sit, left leg over right. Sit for few minutes then half lotus sit again but right leg over left. Feel\nhow they affect the mind states by these right-left-reversi postures.\n7. Do the dhyana mudra with half lotus, hands facing upward. Right hand resting on top of your left palm\nfor few minutes then left hand resting on top of your right palm. Feel and sense the difference. Sense the\nenergy difference.\n8. The purpose of point 6 and 7 is to understand, sense and be aware of \"energy balance\" in our body. Left\nhanded people when cross their right leg over will have more energy balance. Feel the difference. They are\ndifferent. It will help us settle the mind in sitting meditation.\n9. Tap your body, slap your body then press and massage your body, feel the differences in sensation.\nDon't think, feel and sense deeply difference. Use your hands to first sense and then guide your body\nsensations by tapping, slapping, shaking, massaging your whole body. Open your your whole body\nawareness. Sensations are equally \"mind\".\n10. Stand up with legs about arms length wide. Relax your hands then shake your fingers violently. Feel\nthe sensations, feel the pulsations, feel how the blood flows. Do this especially when you are stress and\nfeel the changing state of your tensions. Use shaking to guide the flow of blood flow and pulsing sensation.\n10. Sense of touch of your palm. Place the hands on your face, chest, stomach, laps and legs and toes each\nfor 10 seconds. Feel the \"touch\" of your palms. Feel the changing state of your mind.\nYou can also try rubbing your hands until you feel the warm of your palm and feel the sense of touch of\nyour hands.\n11. Learn and understand the basics of how the flow of blood, the energy balance, the touch of your palm,\nthe tap and slap of your hands, on different parts of your body and understand how it can affect your own\nmind states. Don't read, don't ask, don't think, like an infant learning how to walk, be innocent, raw, pure\nand primordial. Learn these first hand.\n1270\nTips on Energy Imbalances\n12. Lastly take less inflammatory diet, it is crucial and and poop regularly (several times a day if\npossible)...haha.\n13. Practice these for few months and tell me how your body awareness is open up and how it helps in\nsettling your mind naturally by opening up your body awareness. It is also how one sense, activate and\nregulate \"qi\" and \"prana\". Integrate this with anatta insight and understand your \"body\" is equally \"mind\".\nWhen your body awareness is open up, in every engagement, you will engaged naturally with your whole\nbody-mind.”\nSomeone asked,\n\"I started contemplating seriously on the anatta stanzas/6 sense spheres, and felt close to a breakthrough.\nHowever, since 2 days ago, my head feels extremely heavy with a constant pressure. There is also the\nsensation of a drill drilling from the inside of my forehead near the \"third eye\" area. Stopped all forms of\nmeditation/contemplation, although any form of concentrative activity seems to increase the symptoms.\nNot sure yet if it's a blockage being dissolved for realization, or an energy imbalance. Just in case, I re-read\nthe energy imbalance section in the ebook 2 times, and tried Hakuin's soft-butter method, grounding\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/2zn8ev/grounding_201_two_effective_quick_methods/),\nand light stretches. Messaged the poster on Zen sickness for the qigong method, but haven't tried the\nqigong Youtube video linked in the ATR guide.\nAnything else I should do just in case? If I restart anatta contemplation in the future, are there any\ncountermeasures I should be aware of?\"\nSoh replied,\n\"Don’t think or contemplate for now. Be somatic and ground your energy to the earth and do abdominal\nbreathing\nWere you overfocusing when you practice previously? Don’t overfocus on anything particular.\nAnatta realisation will lead to effortless presence that is the opposite of concentrative. Natural and\neffortless. So don’t think you need to concentrate hard to achieve breakthrough\nFor example in breathing there is just the breath.. in hearing there is only sound. This is not telling you to\nconcentrate deeply into sound in order to merge with sound. It is just a realisation that in hearing there is\nalways only sound, never a hearer. No concentration needed or effort to “merge”\nBut don’t contemplate this for now, just relax.\n1271\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nIn your practice you should be spacious and immense as the universe but light as a feather.\nAfter you resolve your energy issues, maybe two weeks later you may want to read Clarifying the Natural\nState by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal\nAn excerpt:\n“Moreover, a wide-awake state of empty and aware mind after making yourself intensely mindful, may be\nregarded as the meditation. Even though this indeed is the meditation practice, it is still imperfect in the\nsense of disliking a natural, free and wide-open presence of mind and, instead, preferring to focus\nexcessively in an unrelaxed way.\nIt is, therefore, extremely important not to be confused about the flawed ways of meditation practice.\nThe imperfect ways of training still have the possibility of progress, but they are awkward to sustain and so\ninvolve the risk of wearying of practice. Through various ways of focusing and relaxing in all instances -\nperceiving or being empty, thinking or being calm - you must thor- oughly investigate and recognize, so as\nto find a comfort- able way to sustain it.”\nYou can get that book for $2 at https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/05/mahamudra-books-for-\ncheap.html \"\nUpdate, 2024 by Soh:\nAvoiding Energy Imbalances https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/02/avoiding-energy-\nimbalances.html\nSoh:\nImportant message for everyone.\nThe two stanzas of anatta (https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-\nspontaneous.html) are linked to this: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/06/pellucid-no-self-non-\ndoership.html\n[8:40 PM, 6/9/2021] John Tan: 1. Dzogchen has a phrase \"spontaneous presence\". I do not know it's exact\nmeaning in dzogchen however the phrase is intimately related to the 2 experiences of the 2 stanzas:\n1. No doership = spontaneous\n2. Mere appearances as Presence\n1272\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nYou'll see that I wrote about both aspects in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/04/why-awakening-\nis-so-worth-it.html\nWithout realizing of the second stanza of anatta in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/03/on-\nanatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html , it is not considered genuine anatman (no-self) realisation in AtR.\nRelated: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/06/pellucid-no-self-non-doership.html ,\nhttp://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/07/i-was-having-conversation-with-someone.html ,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/02/the-transient-universe-has-heart.html ,\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2023/05/nice-advice-and-expression-of-anatta-in.html\nI have also remarked that 99% of the time, people who said they realised no-self merely experienced the\nnon-doership aspect and not the genuine nondual anatman realisation. Also see:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/04/different-degress-of-no-self-non.html\nBased on my experiences from discussions with thousands of individuals, I've observed that claims of\nrecognizing nonduality—where there's no differentiation between the internal and external, or an\nabsence of self—do not necessarily indicate a true realization of anatman or an authentic nondual\nexperience or insight. Often, there is a chance that the person is simply adopting specific jargon or\nimitating others, under the impression that they have reached a similar level of understanding. However,\nin reality, their experience may only encompass a sense of impersonality and non-doership, rather than a\ngenuine nondual experience or insight.\nI (Soh) have once asked John Tan if he thinks a certain teacher has realised anatta, to which John replied,\n“There is no authentication of one's radiance, no recognition of appearances as one's radiance and no\nclear pointing of how conventional constructs (Soh: are seen through and released). So what led you to\nthat conclusion?”\nAdditionally, commenting on a certain teacher’s writings, John Tan wrote,\n“When we say \"Mind is the great earth\", the first step is to understand and taste what is mind before we\ngo a step further.\nIf the teaching doesn't teach and taste what mind is, then it is just beautiful talks and grandious speech.\nNext one has to point out what is \"great earth\"? Where is this \"great earth\"? The soil, the ground, the\nflower, the air or buildings or the conventional world?\nThen talk about what is total exertion they have been talking?\nThen the integration of the mind and total exertion and that is +A.”\n1273\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nHowever it does not mean the second stanza of anatta is more important than the first stanza. In fact, after\nawakening the second stanza of anatta, the pellucid radiance as all appearances beyond the paradigm of\nsubject-action-object, it is vital to penetrate deeply into the first stanza.\nEverything self-arises without doer or agent, as natural as breathing and heart beating. Thoroughly\npenetrating this, be completely spontaneous and effortless and releasing. Natural radiance is completely\neffortless, 0 effort required at all. Let deep insight into anatman and emptiness carry you into self-liberation\nand spontaneous perfection and dissolve the disease of effort and subtle overfocusing or clinging to\nradiance. As John Tan also said before, it is important not to over emphasize on the radiance (lest it causes\nthe unpleasant effects of energy imbalance), and that it must be complemented with the first stanza of\nnon-doership. He added that after non-dual, one's practice must be relaxed and open, insubstantial and\nfree -- be natural and open, light, relaxed and effortless, then contemplate on effortlessness. The openness\nand relaxation should build up into a momentum in one's practice. Additionally, as John Tan said, we have\nto understand the relationship between non-doership and total exertion -- allowing the totality of the\nsituations to exert itself. Seen from one side of the coin, it is complete \"effortlessness\" of radiance, and\nseen from another side, it is the exertion of the totality of conditions.\nSatsang Nathan videos are a good expression of the non-doership aspect of anatta. See: Satsang Nathan\nVideos\nTo emphasize: building up the momentum mentioned above in practice is crucial. To paraphrase John\nTan, \"You must engage in regular practice and refrain from pretentious wisdom until a certain\nmomentum builds. Only then can you hope to overcome challenges associated with x’s issues. I am\nsincere in my advice; you have not yet experienced these issues firsthand, but when you do, you will\nunderstand the importance of mastering this art.\nIf you practice meditation consistently, both in opening up and in your daily life, a momentum will\neventually develop. Even when challenges arise, if you can manage to stay calm and allow this\nmomentum to guide you, you will find yourself capable of overcoming them.\nIt resembles the art of letting go, although it's quite challenging to articulate effectively. Our natural\ntendency leans towards attachment, regardless of how much we try to convince ourselves otherwise. This\nis why consistent practice is essential.\nYou may spend all day discussing the concept of freedom from all elaborations, the natural state, and\nsounds, and you might even gain some insights. However, when you are confronted with these issues for\nvarious reasons, all your attachments will come to the forefront.\nFears about death, health, and personal anomalies will emerge. Your mind will struggle to release these\nattachments.”\nJohn Tan also told X before, “You got good karma...just relax and understand that essencelessness also\nimplies effortlessness, don't focus, don't concentrate. Simply refine the view and understanding after\nanatta insight that appearances are one's radiance.”\n1274\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nJohn also wrote to X, a friend of ours, “Can be overcomed. I used to have very intense energy disruptions\nof energy imbalance post I AM due to over focusing.\nCurrently I think it is better to let the body and mind calm down first through distractions, shifting\nattentions...the body and mind at the very subtle level is very sensitive, the hidden fear will just sway ur\nentire balance.\nMedicines do help and I think you should.\nWe must be very careful, there is relaxation of mind that lead to more alertness and there is the\nrelaxation that calms the mind into peace via overcoming afflictions (eg fear).\nWhen we are in a state of later, then we can rest and response to conditions in balance.”\nJohn also wrote to me before, “ Focus on \"effortlessness\" first, then later you release you can let go of ur\nthoughts and let what happen happens as happening...but you may later feel you are unable to\nconcentrate, it's ok...slowly and gently recall that appearances are one's own radiance, then radiance is by\nnature beyond effort...get use to it first.\nWhatever appears by nature self liberates.”\nIf insight and practice is not mature in this aspect and radiance becomes strong, and one subtly overfocuses\non the radiance, one runs the risk of encountering painful energy imbalances leading to stuck energy in the\nbrow chakra, serious tension, headaches, insomnia (literally 0 sleep at night, super consciousness\nthroughout night which some mistakes as accomplishment), waves of energy that feels like panic attacks (I\nsaid feels like because it was more of a bodily than a mental fear, it was a very tense and “nervous” bodily\nsensation running through the body), and worse symptoms than that. I've had such unpleasant encounters\nin 2019 for seven days, as detailed in https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2019/03/the-magical-fairytale-\nlike-wonderland.html. This leads to what is known as 'zen sickness' which doctors will not be able to cure,\nand I have dedicated a whole chapter to this topic in the original AtR guide. I've been fortunate to have not\nre-trigger such episodes through a shift in practice but have seen others experience something similar. So,\nit is my heartfelt wish that people don't go in the wrong direction in practice. Please take care and practice\nwell.\nPerhaps if you are interested in Dzogchen, receive transmission and teachings from Dzogchen teacher\nAcarya Malcolm Smith (who also likewise stressed on this crucial aspect of non-doership and effortlessness\nof radiance appearances in anatta, and the integration of the 2 stanzas of anatta -- it is not in his public\nwritings but in his online teachings to subscribers which I attended) and get the book 'The Supreme Source'\nwhich elucidates clearly the total effortlessness of spontaneously perfect and self-arising nature of total\npresence. But please do not DIY Dzogchen as that will be extremely misleading, but rather find good\nteachers (e.g. Acarya Malcolm) in that tradition. You can watch this YouTube video (highly recommended)\nfor an introduction to Acarya Malcolm’s Dzogchen teachings that was recommended by Sim Pern Chong\non the AtR group: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2023/09/talk-on-buddhahood-in-this-life.html .\n1275\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nAlso, some of Malcolm’s writings can be found here\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2014/02/clarifications-on-dharmakaya-and-basis_16.html . To\npractice that book \"The Supreme Source\", empowerment, direct introduction and guidance from a qualified\nDzogchen teacher is necessary, and it is certainly not to be mistaken as lazing around without practice nor\nthe nihilism of neo-Advaita. Case in point: https://dharmaconnectiongroup.blogspot.com/2015/08/ground-\npath-fruition_13.html\nHere’s a good video shared by John Tan:\nMind, attention, energy, focus, are one.\nWhen you practice, especially awareness practitioners, who practice in a focused way will lead to an\nenergy imbalance where energy get stuck in the brow chakra. It is very common for awareness\npractitioners. Either brow or sometimes heart chakra blockages.\nHowever the insights of anatman by itself is very safe, in fact in full actualization of anatman, there cannot\nbe energy imbalances. Energy imbalances are all tied to subtle selfing. This is why complete maturation\nand actualization of both stanzas of anatta (without skewing to the 2nd) will resolve energy imbalance.\nSo your practice should bring and base your mind on the Dantien. The energy should flow and not be\nstuck in the head. Being somatic helps with overcoming energy imbalances.\nSee Vase Breathing:\nExcerpt from https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2020/09/frank-yang-video-full-enlightenment.html\n[11:46 AM, 9/5/2020] John Tan: I like his descriptions, quite good but may result in energy imbalances. Best\nis to practice breathing exercises and learn to regulate the energy into calmness...\nComments by Soh:\nOne good way to regulate energy through breathing exercise is to practice the vase breathing.\nHere is an excerpt from “Open Mind, Open Heart” by Tsoknyi Rinpoche:\n“Vase Breathing\nOne of the methods that helped this woman and countless others cope with emotions is a practice that\nhelps us draw lung back to its center, or “home.” For this, we use a special breathing technique as a tool,\nbecause breath is a physical correlation to the subtle wind energy of lung.\n1276\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nThis technique is called vase breathing, and it involves breathing even more deeply than the type of deep\ndiaphragmatic breathing often taught in many yoga and other types of classes with which people may be\nfamiliar.\nThe technique itself is rather simple. First, exhale slowly and completely, collapsing the abdominal muscles\nas close to the spine as possible. As you slowly breathe in, imagine that you’re drawing your breath down\nto an area about four finger widths below your navel, just above your pubic bone. This area is shaped a bit\nlike a vase, which is why the technique is called vase breathing. Of course, you’re not really drawing your\nbreath down to that region, but by turning your attention there, you will find yourself inhaling a bit more\ndeeply than usual and will experience a bit more of an expansion in the vase region.\nAs you continue to draw your breath in and your attention down, your lung will gradually begin to travel\ndown there and begin to rest there. Hold your breath down in the vase region just for a few seconds - don’t\nwait until the need to exhale becomes urgent - then slowly breathe out again.\nJust breathe slowly this way three or four times, exhaling completely and inhaling down into the vase area.\nAfter the third or fourth inhalation, try holding a little bit of your breath - maybe 10 percent - in the vase\narea at the end of the exhalation, focusing very lightly and gently on maintaining a bit of lung in its home\nplace.\nTry it now.\nExhale completely and then breathe slowly and gently down to the vase area three or four times, and on\nthe last exhalation, hold a little bit of breath in the vase area. Keep this up for about ten minutes.\nHow did that feel?\nMaybe it was a little uncomfortable. Some people have said that directing their breath in this way is difficult.\nOthers have said that doing so gave them a sense of calmness and centeredness they’d never felt before.\nVase breathing, if practiced ten or even twenty minutes every day, can become a direct means of developing\nawareness of our feelings and learning how to work with them even while we’re engaged in our daily\nactivities. When our lung is centered in its home place, our bodies, or feelings, and our thoughts gradually\nfind a healthy balance. The horse and rider work together in a very loose and easy way, neither trying to\nseize control or drive the other crazy. In the process, we find that subtle body patterns associated with fear,\npain, anxiety, anger, restlessness, and so on gradually loosen up, that there’s a little bit of space between\nthe mind and the feelings.\nUltimately the goal is to be able to maintain that small bit of breath in the vase area throughout the day,\nduring all our activities - walking, talking, eating, drinking, driving. For some people, this ability becomes\nautomatic after only a short while of practice. For others, it may require a bit more time.\n1277\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nI have to admit that, even after years of practicing, I still find that I sometimes lose my connection to my\nhome base, especially when meeting with people who are very speedy. I’m a bit of a speedy person myself,\nand meeting other speedy people acts as a kind of subtle body stimulus. I get caught up in their restless\nand displaced energy and consequently become a bit restless, nervous, and sometimes even anxious. So I\ntake what I call a reminder breath: exhaling completely, breathing down into the vase area, and then\nexhaling again leaving a little bit of breath in the lung’s home.”\nJohn Tan also said,\n“Energy imbalance are very related to what we conventionally termed as \"physical\". Energies in\nspirituality are the \"physical\" aspects in our modern conventional usage, it is just lingo difference. So do\nexercises and learn the art of openness and effortlessness, open our body, be pragmatic and sincere.\nVase breathing exercises are all good but need discipline, persistency and perseverance, not some 三分钟\n热度. (Soh: three minutes of enthusiasm) When practiced with diligence with no magical or fairy tales\nmentality [it] will sure have benefits.”\n“[10:16 AM, 6/29/2020] John Tan: Frank is very experiential, no need to be too theoretical into emptiness,\nnon-arisen of phenomena for now.\nRather it is to allow him to move the energy and radiance to his body...entire body...although the\nbackground is gone, you may think that all six senses are in equal radiance but it is far from truth in real\ntime and causes all the energy imbalances.\nRelax into the natural state and feel the energetic radiance over the entire body. Not by way of\nthinking. Touch anything, touch the toes, they legs, feel them. It is your mind...lol...can you understand\nthat?\n[10:23 AM, 6/29/2020] John Tan: The mountain is mind, the grasses are mind, everything is mind. That is\nthrough the vision and mental, feel the body, toes fingers, touch them. They are mind. So do you\nunderstand that in real time?\nAs for sleep don't worry too much, it will happen and use less thoughts, let whole body be a sense of touch\nnot by thinking, but feel and touch it. So don't think that when insight of all is mind anatta arise, means\nyou are already into all is mind. If you can't embrace and feel all as mind, how are you to eliminate the\ncommon denominator called mind and into no mind which is the natural state of anatta.”\nLabels: Anatta, Energy |\nNote: Serious energy imbalances related to depression and anxiety and traumas should be treated with\nthe expert help of psychiatrists and psychologists, possibly with the medications as support. Modern\n1278\nTips on Energy Imbalances\nmedicine can be a vital and important part of healing and should never be downplayed. If you exhibit\nsymptoms that may be related to these, you should be checked out by professionals.\nIn Soh's case of 7 days of energy imbalances in 2019, it was not related to mental issues as there was no\ndepression, sad mood, or mental anxiety (aside from bodily sensations of tensions), nor was it related to\ntraumas, but instead it was due to extreme intensity of luminosity - an intensity that persists throughout\nthe day and into sleep, and an energy pattern of overfocusing and tenseness that was difficult to dissolve.\nThat said, if you are unsure, it's better to get checked out. Additionally, you can also check out books by\nJudith Blackstone, which goes deeply into trauma release and relates it with nondual practice (although not\nexactly based on anatta practice, still it is worth reading). See:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2024/06/good-book-on-healing-trauma-and-nondual.html\nJohn Tan also said, “There is a big difference between depressions caused by work or physical\nappearances or lack of family support...etc and issues for example related to \"I AM\". All those anxieties\nthat relate to physical appearances or work load or studies etc will gradually release if the respective\nissues are solved. But there are issues that are like \"I AM\" that is your first immediate thought, so close\nand so immediate that are not easy to \"rid\".”\n“Some (energy imbalances) may relate to opening of certain energy gates when body is not ready also.”\nAccording to John Tan, to prevent energy, non-doership and calmness it extremely key. There must be a\nbalance.\n[6/6/24, 11:54:22 PM] John Tan: Yes don't let conventional achievements hinder one's practice and yes\nanatta is just the beginning, once we recognize appearances as one's radiance, we must exhaust both mind\nand phenomena.\nAlthough I m not a dzogchen or mahamudra practitioner, I can understand and intuit the natural state of\nfully actualizing anatta as quite similar to rainbow body like kind of result too.\n[6/6/24, 11:55:09 PM] Soh Wei Yu: I see..\n[6/6/24, 11:58:37 PM] John Tan: In fact after certain degree of exhausting mind's reifications, we get less\nattached to the conventional and are very drawn towards exhausting our entire body-mind into radiance\nof lights.

When one is totally and non-dually\naware, he is also fully alive and open. Experiencing one without the other isn't complete.

In the end, it\ncomes down to repetition, persistence and overcoming the habitual addiction to comfort (which is\nalso a useful vector for investigating dukkha).\nAn earlier bedtime and progressively earlier wake-up were where I started, because hauling my\nass out of bed were the most challenging for me. I started out waking up at 0900 instead of 1100\nor 1200, and each week I would get up an hour earlier until I was able to consistently get out of\nbed at 0500.\nWaking up early doesn't sound like it would make all that much difference, but for me it was a\ngame changer. Pushing yourself to do things you don't like doing (within reason, of course) or that\nare difficult for you sets up new habits and pathways in the brain. You're basically reprogramming\nthe bodymind to respond in healthier ways to stress and hardship, which can make future\nencounters with difficult conditions more manageable.\nIt's hard to go from baseline to a brand new routine in one fell swoop, so I'd suggest changing\nsmall things gradually. Like I said, I started with waking up earlier; once I knew I could do that, it\ngave me more confidence to make changes in other areas, e.g. addiction, mental health, etc. Each\ntime you successfully stick to your routine, you'll feel good about it and it'll reinforce the habit.\nYour confidence in your ability to make changes grows each time. One way of putting is \"small\nwins, stacked daily\" as each \"win\" feeds into the next.\nThe non-negotiable part is probably the most difficult to get to grips with at first, but bloody\nminded persistence is what will do the damage. Using earlier wake-up times as an example again:\nIt's natural that you'll wake up, look at the clock and think \"screw this, I'm going back to sleep\", but\nthis is where you need to intervene. As soon as that thought arises, that's when you remind\nyourself that you're changing your routine/habit and drag your ass out of bed. Doing this\nrepeatedly will make it easier, and eventually you'll get to a point where sleeping past your wake-\nup time feels horrible. Instead of luxuriously lounging in bed, there's an automatic pull towards\ngetting up and moving.\nI need to go just now, but I'll try to add more when I have time.\n1282\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\n6\nReply\n• · 2w\nTyler Jones\nTommy McNally really good advice, thanks.\n“Prana (Soh: energy, life, breath, or chi) and the apparent body, they are not related to mind, they are mind.\nOpening and regulating the apparent\nbody, is opening and regulating the mind.\nWas very much inspired by some truly profound and insightful texts (Soh: a Dzogchen text) about vayu,\nbody and mind that Kyle Dixon sent me a few weeks ago. 🙂”\n- John Tan, 2018\n“Body is Mind\nWhat we called \"body\" is just \"Mind\".\nMassaging the body, is massaging Mind.\nDetoxing the body, is cleansing Mind.\nFeeling the breath, is feeling Mind.\nIntegrate the body fully in practice,\nFor the body has always been what we called - \"Mind\".”\n“For non-dual junkies:\nIf you neglect the conventional, don't talk about the ultimate.\nFor the ultimate is merely the emptiness of the conventional.\nIf you neglect \"body\", don't talk about \"mind\".\nFor \"body\" and \"mind\" are merely distinct conventionally,\nUltimately they lack sameness or difference.\n- John Tan, 2021\nWhat is most important is how you can understand deeply the energy circulatory of your body and\nhow it helps to expand and open our pristine consciousness… ...Body is a whole universe of itself.\nIt cannot be just knowledge, it has to be intimate to the very depth. Intimate to [the] depth that\nyou can feel no distinction between body and consciousness.\n1283\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\n- John Tan, 2019\n\"In Vajrayāna, cakras are areas in the body where the venous, arterial and nerves collect, generally\naround vital organs. Where these channels [nadis] converge are areas where the vāyu becomes more\nconcentrated.\nThe point of a knowledge of where nadi and vāyu collects is related to a knowledge of how to manipulate\nthe body to in turn control the mind. The mind or consciousness, rides the vāyu. And actually in some\nsystems, mind [citta] and vāyu are held to be synonymous, no difference at all. If vāyu is coordinated then\nthe mind will be calm and pliable, alternatively if the vāyu is agitated then the mind will be chaotic with\nlots of concepts and thoughts.\nVajrayāna has a strong emphasis on the body for this very reason, and cakras are one aspect of the yogic\nunderstanding of physiology.\nThe ability to control the body and in turn the mind in this way means a practitioner of Vajrayāna can\nestablish states of dhyāna and samādhi much more rapidly than systems that only employ methods like\nsamatha solely to enter dhyāna.\" - Kyle Dixon, 2021\n“Tibetan Buddhists practice tsa lung or trul khor which is pranayama, sometimes called “yantra yoga.”\nThese Tibetan and Indian physical yogas are the basis for what later became hatha yoga and so on.\nIn Vajrayāna, the premise is that the mind or consciousness is inseparable from the vāyu, which is the air\nelement within the body. The vāyus circulate throughout the body via the nadis or channels. As such,\nthrough postures and breathing methods, you control the nadis and the vāyu, and once the vāyu is\ncoordinated, then the mind becomes calm and pliable.\nSome Buddhist systems emphasize sitting meditation, and as a result, eventually access dhyāna and\nsamādhi. In Vajrayāna, through applying pranayama, that same dhyāna and samādhi is accessed much\nmore rapidly.\nIn this way, these physical yogas as applied through the lens of the buddhadharma become a vehicle to\nawakening just the same as other meditation techniques, and when coupled with other meditation\ntechniques, these physical yogas are a powerful supplement and method which greatly enhance one’s\npath and practice.\nThere should be absolutely no conflict. If the conflict is based in doctrine, then study the Buddhist view\nand understand what you are doing... the premise isn’t different. The point of departure is the nuances of\nthe soteriological frameworks as u/animuseternal noted. In practice however, you are going to end up\naccomplishing the same result, the coordination of vāyu and mind.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\n“[3/12/15, 9:03:06 PM] John Tan: Actually when you practice yoga, if you got the 慧根 (faculty of\nwisdom)... you will realise the purpose of the asanas to prepare the body to fully open up itself.

If anyone can do this, especially in only the time it takes to read, then I would consider\nsuch a person a master of meditation. \"Make sure the body is relaxed. Close your eyes. Take a few deep\nbreaths. Feel yourself breathing into the lower abdomen, as it were. Observe how it expands and\ncontracts slightly with each in and out breath. Then become aware of the entire inner energy field of the\nbody. Don’t think about it — feel it. By doing this, you reclaim consciousness from the mind. When you\ncan feel the inner body clearly as a single field of energy, let go, if possible, of any visual image and focus\nexclusively on the feeling. If you can, also drop any mental image you may still have of the physical body.\nAll that is left then is an all-encompassing sense of presence or “beingness,” and the inner body is felt to\nbe without a boundary. Then take your attention even more deeply into that feeling. Become one with it.\nMerge with the energy field, so that there is no longer a perceived duality of the observer and the\nobserved, of you and your body. The distinction between inner and outer also dissolves now, so there is\nno inner body anymore. By going deeply into the body, you have transcended the body. Stay in this realm\nof pure Being for as long as feels comfortable; then become aware again of the physical body, your\nbreathing and physical senses, and open your eyes. Look at your surroundings for a few minutes in a\n1286\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\nmeditative way — that is, without labeling them mentally — and continue to feel the inner body as you do\nso.\" Just now · Unlike · 1\nJohn TanSunday, March 1, 2015 at 4:08pm UTC+08\nHere it is more about dissolving the boundaries into presence which is not necessary for you.

Have discipline first and need a minimum of 3 years to have tangible effect. Currently your mind\ndevelopment is ok but your body and energy level understanding and relationship with one's clarity isn't\nthere. Discipline, wisdom and willingness to let go are the 3 key factors needed if you want to go far. Not\neasy to have all 3 factors present.\n[10/4/16, 1:01:20 PM] John Tan: Currently your cells in your lungs, abdomen are all not awakened.

Similarly...concentration\nand focus in sitting meditation... Also needs practice. If you keep your focus, internal alchemy takes\nplace...all these are not easy to explain but requires one to be attentive. So though a teacher's view may\nnot be inline, there are invaluable meditative experiences he can share. You must start learning deep\nbreathing exercises and yoga...then you will progress. Your mind luminosity is very much hindered after\ncertain level... Dissolving constructs cannot clear your body hinderance...

Only on the ultimate realisation of Presence you have the experience\nbut varies in intensity. Actually it is how to expand consciousness that is the ultimate aim...but the path is\ndifferent so focus is different. Few look into the depth of conventions and dependent origination and how\nconsciousness is being proliferated. Similarly there are also some aspects that need complement with the\ninsights. Just treat it as health first and train yourself to have discipline.\"\nEnergy practices and yoga should be demonstrated and guided by a live teacher. There are actual cases\nof practitioners who did real damage and injury to their body and energy system by attempting certain\nenergy practices or yoga postures by themselves without expert guidance. It is not within the scope of\nthis guide to show you step by step what to do, plus there should be many yoga studios around you and\neven online videos you can follow. As for energy practices, you will need to find an energy master. At the\npoint of writing, I (Soh) am still far from mastery or expertise in yoga or energy practices, hence I am not\nin a position to be able to personally guide or advice on the specifics of these practices, and I do not want\nto be misleading readers. Rather, I just want to encourage readers to adopt a kind of somatic/yoga\npractice in addition to whatever other practices one might be doing, whether one is practice self-enquiry\nor vipassana. Just make sure you do not overstrain yourself as many people have become injured by\ndoing yoga too strenuously. Listen to your body, not your ego. Find a good teacher and do not go for\nextreme poses or push yourself too hard, safety comes first. If you wish to begin yoga practice, first start\nwith the basics. Yoga is not a competition and do not let your ego get you - if someone else can do certain\nposes, do not force yourself too much just because you think that you can do it too. Others may have\nmore flexibility by nature or have practiced yoga for many more years ahead of you.\nJohn Tan told me (Soh) in the past that the deep breathing that accompanies the asanas (postures) are\neven more important than the asanas themselves, although both posture and breathing have their\nimportance in shifting our energy patterns. Although there are many yoga teachers out there, many of\nthem focuses more on the asanas (postures) while neglecting the importance of breath. So be mindful of\n1289\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\nthis. Additionally, one should practice vipassana, mindfully aware of the bodily sensations and poses\nwhile doing any form of yoga and somatic practices.\n“John TanSaturday, July 25, 2015 at 5:12am UTC+08\nDeep breathing exercises are important for health and vital energy. You are working more along the line\nof 精气神 (essence, qi (energy) and spirit) perspective. But many do not have the patience and 悟性\n(capacity of realizing) to realize the essence. Youngsters do not have the perseverance and persistency to\nreally practice therefore they cannot go very far.\nJohn TanSaturday, July 25, 2015 at 5:20am UTC+08\nIt is like normal exercises, nothing special but you must dedicate an hour daily and practice for a few yrs\nto see the effect. When your lungs expand and your body is able to keep the air overtime… your body\nbecomes tender and alive...when your inner muscle developed due to persistent deep breathing, your\nDan tian will be filled with energy but it is an integrated flow. You won't be able to breathe deeply and\nsmoothly now...because your inner organs do not have enough exercises.

How does the cells become vibrantly alive? The clarity has its supporting conditions. Your\nradiance I don't think is even close to mine. Centerlessness is an important factor. But one must have\nright understanding. Your organs will fail. Your mind can still become fatigued. Drugs will cause you to\nsleep, psychedelic drugs will have its effect.

Not\nall. The body has lots of deep karmic patterns. Like I tell you to learn breathing, you must practice with\ndiligence. When you breathe, it may not be smooth and rhythmic. When you inhale or exhale, there may\nbe separation. In different asanas, will also cause different pattern to surface but many will not be able to\naware unless they are very mindful. So on top of mental deconstruction, you must also learn how to\nrelease these deeply hidden patterns in our body especially when you are young.”\nJohn TanMonday, June 8, 2015 at 8:38am UTC+08\nIt is like abdominal breathing... you can breathe with abdominal easily because you are so used to\nbreathing with lungs.

If you keep your focus, internal alchemy takes place...all these are not easy to explain but\nrequires one to be attentive.\n[10/4/16, 1:06:21 PM] John Tan: So though teacher's view may not be inline, there are invaluable\nmeditative experiences he can share.\n[10/4/16, 1:07:21 PM] John Tan: you must start learning deep breathing exercises and yoga...then you will\nprogress. your mind luminosity is very much hindered after certain level...\n1292\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\n[10/4/16, 1:07:59 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[10/4/16, 1:08:11 PM] John Tan: Dissolving constructs cannot clear your body hinderance...\n[10/4/16, 1:09:02 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Ic..\n[10/4/16, 1:10:22 PM] John Tan: But go slow with yoga...don't injure yourself\n[26/8/17, 8:49:43 PM] John Tan: To take in enough oxygen, your lung and rib cage, traverse muscles,\nabdominal must all be prepared and ready. All these take time. Then when you breathless the long\nsmooth power of exhalation will bring your into relaxation. Will bring you into selflessness. If you lose\nthe sense of self, in one deep inhalation, the feeling of intimate \"connection\" with the different parts of\nyour body as well as outside of your body will be felt...The \"felt sense\" will bring you into thoughtless total\nexertion.\n[30/6/18, 4:28:23 PM] John Tan: Spiritual can help to certain extend.

Overtime you\nwill know how to use your breathing and internal mindful scanning and exercises like nauli to activAte\nenergy internally and relax.\n[30/6/18, 4:34:29 PM] John Tan: Means like use your breathing to expand your lungs and abdominal.\nKeep doing until you are relax and alive.\n[18/8/18, 6:18:30 PM] John Tan: In anatta, we realized, consciousness and energy are just the same. If we\nseparate, then we have to link back in the form of cause and effect.\n[18/8/18, 6:23:38 PM] John Tan: Prajna is not just air but vital energy. To activate and regulate vital\nenergy, you need to know how to use your breath as well as asanas. Using the basic of inhalation,\nexhalation, rentention and inversion to regulate them.\n[18/8/18, 6:26:22 PM] John Tan: Asanas is not only about stretches, it is 经脉 (nadis) and breath. Each\nasanas opens them with breath. It is wrong to think that it is just flexibility and the teacher has guided\nand explained wrongly.\n[18/8/18, 6:28:32 PM] John Tan: Like if you put both legs behind head, your entire abdominal is stretch\nalso even beyond nauli. When you breathe in that position, it also activate your heart and crown channel\nin a powerful way, you open them.\n[18/8/18, 6:29:25 PM] John Tan: you can't breath properly and takes a lot of time to learn how to regulate\nyour breathing in that position.\n1293\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\n[18/8/18, 6:31:16 PM] John Tan: you don't have to learn those things. In fact you just have to learn\ninhalation, exhalation, retention and inversion and be mindful of the your body awareness. In yoga you\nhave very lil thoughts, just movement, breath and body awareness.\n[18/8/18, 6:34:34 PM] John Tan: Learning serious energy practice is not about words, you have to start\nfrom young and learn step by step. There are too many things to learn about breath, energy, mind. Even\nyou use your whole life you will not be able to understand...so start young.\n[18/8/18, 6:35:07 PM] John Tan: When you practice, don't think, don't try to understand but listen to your\nbody, it is different way of understand. It is body awareness, felt sense and mindfulness.\n[18/8/18, 6:36:41 PM] John Tan: I call you to go yoga under guidance of teachers because asanas can be\nproned to life-time injuries if you are not careful. So don't go for exortic poses...\n“A great explanation on body-awareness but still dualistic in nature, will not be able to fully integrate mind\nand body seamlessly. Nevertheless, still a good video. 👍\nhttps://youtu.be/VGNDBGjF6hg (Get Out of your Head - Awaken Your Body Awareness - Emotional\nRelease - Empath Empowerment)” - John Tan, 2019\n“Yantra yoga is also integral to dzogchen practice. Malcolm taught that in order to attain rainbow body in\nthis life, one has to do yantra yoga and control vayu (vayu is wind/energy/qi/prana).\nMalcolm recommends that people practice yantra yoga. He taught that people of great capacity progress\nmore quickly, people of lesser capacity more slowly, but this is a function of vayu in the body, which is\nwhy most people who achieve rainbow body in this lifetime, like Uncle Tokden, Norbu Rinpoche’s uncle,\nthey are also great yogis of yantra yoga. Because they have control over their vayu. And we do need to\nhave control over our vayu. We practice yantra yoga as subsidiary practices which help and assist our\nrealization. But if we don’t practice yantra yoga it’s also ok, as it states in the rigpa rangshar tantra, most\nyogis of Dzogchen achieve liberation in the bardo of dharmata, not rainbow body, but if you’re very\ndiligent and you gain great control over the vayu in your body, then you can have the possibility of\nrainbow body in this lifetime.” – Soh, 2020\nJohn Tan likes this video on Nauli - the music, explanation and her control - and practices Nauli himself:\nhttps://youtu.be/xcJquSsdIqA - Udiyana Nauli Mahamudra by Lila Poit\nJohn Tan extolled the benefits of Nauli many times.\n“You must breathe until your inner organs are activated… until you can feel the vital energy flow… the\nintensity of vibrational sensation throughout… then consciousness will expand and together with your\nanatta and emptiness insight, your experience and insight will be powerful and deep. Nauli kriya is not\nonly a very powerful cleansing technique but crucial when you can integrate it with breathing control.” -\nJohn Tan, 2016\n\"Energy practice must start from naval base... You will know why next time...now you still don’t have\n1294\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\nexperience of how energy moves...how is energy like at each gate and what is it actually...lol. you cannot\njust focus on brow and crown, not suitable for most.\nNext time when you are back then teach you in detail.

Going for basic yoga class is good and\nlearn step by step. Our mind states are far beyond what you can imagine now.”\n[12/3/19, 10:16:24 PM] John Tan: You need at least 2-3 years of diligent practice. Start with abdominal\nbreathing. Don't think of nonsense and mystical stuff, just focus on energy balance and circulation. Use\nyour breath to open and massage your internal organs. Treat it as a form of inner body exercise and\npurge yourself from magical thinking. Actually for circulation, if there are some doctors or masters that\ncan help open your body by acupoints will be very good but you have to find one good and experience\none.”\n“[28/10/17, 10:27:01 PM] John Tan: That teacher that asked those questions is quite good. Zen is in daily\nactivities. Not in thinking. You need to meet situation and everything face to face. Same goes for yoga.\nYou don't think. You face your body moment to moment. If you practice anatta, then body is no more\nbody. Flux of energies...dynamic and have their own patterns. These can't be taught ... You have to\nencounter your so call body fully.

When you open your doors and windows without your fan. How is\nit? When you turn on your fan how is it? How your entire body reacts… All these sensations are unknown\nto you when you are not mindful. But to some people they don't like to be mindful. Lol. For practitioner\nlike me, I enjoy the changing patterns of sensations. So that you know how much your body is not \"body\".\nYour teacher emphasize too much non-conceptual towards non-dual anatta. You should mature your\nunderstanding and know your body as well. It is very difficult for me to tell you anything. But I can only tell\nyou that you will missed a major part if you didn’t know your body. Training of the mind is lopsided. You\nmust use it to insight in all aspects. Like when you experience I AM and attached to it, it is just a dead pool\nof water. Similarly if your cannot apply your insights but just think of the mind, it is very narrow. I can tell\nyou probably one just ended up in thoughts and thinking. If you know that mind is not a background, in\nseeing, on hitting the floor… hearing sound… that is just basic. You must open up your senses and\nsensations. Most Zen Masters self-actualizes themselves but they can't tell you how\n[28/10/17, 10:53:10 PM] Soh Wei Yu: Self actualize as in Practice actualisation?\n[28/10/17, 10:55:49 PM] John Tan: Yeah in everything\n[28/10/17, 11:16:37 PM] Soh Wei Yu: So how is it done\n[28/10/17, 11:17:24 PM] John Tan: Smack your head.

Failing to comprehend this, such people think\nthat practice is about abiding as a split off mind/awareness/spirit unaffected by the conditions of the\nbody, thus dissociating themselves from the body and neglecting the body. Such people are practicing\nwrongly by holding tightly to a dualistic paradigm that causes bondage, and preventing further progress\nin practice for themselves.\nA conversation with John Tan in 2009 reveals the importance of maintaining a healthy body for\nprogression in one’s practice:\n“(4:48 PM) John Tan: for Ven. Jue Xing, it is the mind body drop and the crystal transparency of our\nBuddha mind. How old is she? And what happened to her?\n(4:53 PM) John Tan: to progress into another phase, it is important to do exercise… hehe. A healthy body\nfor a healthy mind. After maturing of anatta insight, it is even more important.\none cannot neglect that. The body must also be able to support the realisation :P\n(4:55 PM) Soh: otherwise like what you said the other time, it will be too intense or something?\n(4:55 PM) John Tan: Yes. After maturing of insight anatta and emptiness, sitting meditation becomes not\nthat important but engagement becomes more important, like practicing the 6 paramitas (Soh: i.e.\n1299\nHealth, Energy and Somatic Practices, Yoga and Diet\ngenerosity, discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration and wisdom. See\nhttps://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Six_paramitas)\n(4:57 PM) John Tan: But still need to sit (Soh: John Tan recommends sitting 45 minutes a day, although you\ncan go further than that if time permits). That is similar to 'dong zhong xiu' (practice amidst movement), the\nexperience becomes maha sort of experience. Means her experience of mind body drop is being\ntransformed into crystal transparency into maha, but it does mean that which state is higher or what…\nthat [Maha] will be like Zen Master Bernie [Glassman]”\n“Keeping yourself healthy and eating right are important. The longer you live the more time you have to\npractice the buddhadharma and benefit others. I’m at the gym as I type this. I’m on a powerlifting\nregiment right now, trying to increase strength. If I was engaged in practices which require me to calm my\nwinds I wouldn’t work out. But I’m not at the moment. There’s no issue with exercising.\n...\n...The winds are the vāyu, which are excited by physical activity, because one’s physiological processes\nnaturally become more active. In Vajrayāna the mind and vāyu are not different. If he vāyu is disturbed\nthe mind will be disturbed. To calm the mind the vāyu must be coordinated and calm. All physical yoga\nrevolves around the coordination of vāyu, then mind becomes more pliable.” - Kyle Dixon, 2019\n(Note: vāyu means the same thing as prāṇa, i.e. wind, air or breath)\nIn terms of diet, here’s a pithy advice by John Tan:\n“The food you eat… try to balance it… more water, more fibre… less meat and inflammatory food… listen\nto your body, be in touch with your body… till your circulatory and excretory system is clean and pure… it\nwill help your awareness...”, “To further open up, you need to have diet that are not inflammatory” (On\nAnti-Inflammatory diet, see https://www.webmd.com/diet/anti-inflammatory-diet-road-to-good-health)\nJohn Tan eats fruits (bananas and apples) and drinks oat milk for breakfast.\nFasting from time to time is also a good way to increase and improve one’s clarity, according to John Tan.\nPlus there is a lot of science that suggests fasting will improve a person’s health and\nlongevity. ”Intermittent fasting, if done responsibly, has some serious scientific backing. A 2016 study\nfrom the University of Southern California revealed that strategic calorie restriction may actually help you\nlive longer.” - https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/11/business/jack-dorsey-intermittent-fasting-twitter-diet-\ntrnd/index.html When I attended a dharma talk by Zen Master Chi Boon in Singapore, he told us his\nsecret to good health and being free from illnesses lies in intermittent fasting.\nFor further understanding on the subtle body (energy) and important instructions on energy practices like\nVase Breathing, I highly recommend reading “Open Mind, Open Heart” by Tsoknyi Rinpoche. Because of\n1300\nEntering the Marketplace, Actualizing Daily Life\nhis relevance and Vase Breathing’s similarity to the Dan Tien breathing practice taught by John Tan to me,\nas well as energy imbalances and the way of overcoming it is also pretty well described by Tsoknyi\nRinpoche, I have personally attended a Subtle Body retreat with Tsoknyi Rinpoche Singapore, 2019.\n“Hara's great. Along with a range of somatic practises from dr Reginald Ray it benefitted my own practice\nmuch in terms of developing stability, calmess and somatic grounding in the body, which helped me in\nturn with inquiry, analysis and meditating on instructions like Bahiya Sutta. Also I find dancing helpful as\nan energy, somatic and mindful movement way of practising (like vajra dances but also modern somatic\ndancing).\nApart from that being a Vajrayana and Dzogchen practitiober I use a plethora of methods to be found in\nthese systems which range from pranayamas and yogic subtle body work through deity yoga, rituals\nworking with symbols to mantras and dynamic meditaitons. I guess I like variety and approaching things\nmultidimensionaly (though always do my best focus on one thing or two for some time to have a degree\nof stability and conscientiousness). Some people probably need more minimalism so I guess its\nindividual.\nAlso metta and the rest of the four immeasurables along with tonglen have been helpful and Ive practised\nthese a lot just before breaking through to Anatta.

In the same way, we\nhave to realize that this life is the only life we have. It’s ours, right now. If we don’t do the cooking\nourselves, we are throwing our life away. “Keep your eyes open,” Dogen instructs. “Wash the rice\nthoroughly, put it in the pot, light the fire, and cook it. There is an old saying that goes ‘See the pot as your\nown head, see the water as your lifeblood.’”\n- Bernard Glassman from “Instructions for the Cook” (read some excerpts at\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/11/rip-zen-master-bernie-glassman.html)\nThe Platform Sutra by the Sixth Ch’an/Zen Patriarch says, “Buddha Dharma is in this world, awakened\nawareness is not apart from the world. If you search for Bodhi (awakened awareness) outside of this\nworld, it is like looking for a rabbit’s horn.”\n(佛法在世间，不离世间觉。离世觅菩提，恰如求兔角)\nA Soto Zen (Dogen’s lineage) teacher Shinshu Roberts says:\n\"...This would not be how Dogen would approach the practice of deep investigation or exhaustive\npenetration. He might be describe the activity of washing dishes as washing washes washing, thereby\nremoving the subject-object relationship. Mindfulness may be a dharma gate to intimacy, but it is not the\nZen practice of exhaustively penetrating the totality of one's experience. In the true intimacy of complete\nengagement there is no labeling of self or other that comes from paying attention to something outside\nthe self….\n…\nIf we follow this way of thinking, when we read that Zen masters express realization while drinking tea\nand eating rice, we believe that the being-time of their drinking and eating must be special and outside\n1302\nEntering the Marketplace, Actualizing Daily Life\ndaily life. How could our eating and drinking be in the same league as that of a Zen master? Zen masters\nsit in grass huts, stillness radiating from the holy mountains that surround them, accompanied by the\nsound of a creek. Their tea is as green as the frog leaping into a nearby pool and their rice is infused with\ntheir enlightened nature. Surely they do not put their pants on one leg at a time!\nFrom this erroneous view, we extrapolate that Zen masters are enlightened outside of the interactive\narising of all dharmas, so-called daily life. Actually, Zen masters are Zen masters because they do not get\ncaught in some idea about reality. Rather, they respond to the arising dharmas in such a way that they\ninclude the totality of each moment, thereby enacting realization. This is a fluid, continuous,\nimpermanent response state.\n…\nIncluded in this intimate total immersion in the being-time of a particular moment is the simultaneous\narising of all being-time. This nondualism is not separate from the relative or everyday. Washing dishes is\nnot special. By entering the world of washing dishes, we enter the whole world, which is our world, by\njumping in with wholehearted effort.” - Being-Time by Shinshu Roberts\n…\nDo not aspire to great realization.

As the sutra explained, habitual obscurations are exceedingly subtle like scent left\nbehind a container hence there is no short-cut to liberation -- it’s all step by step and bit by bit erosion of\nthe nuances and subtleness of “inherentness” in one’s ignorance.” – John Tan, Connecting dots,\nauthenticating DO\n“THE EQUIVALENCE OF THE EIGHT WORLDLY CONCERNS\nSince all things, such as food and clothing, are empty by their nature, what is there for us to gain or lose?\nNothing at all. What praise and honor, what insults and humiliation can be heaped on us and by whom?\nAgain, none.\nExamine the causes for the experience of joy and sadness. They are found to lack inherent existence. What,\nthen, is there that could be unpleasant in being slandered? What is there that could be delightful in being\ncelebrated? Nothing at all. Let us cast aside all discrimination with regard to these eight worldly concerns\nand place our minds in meditation on profound emptiness.\nAs Nagarjuna says in his Suhrillekha:\nRegard as equal, you who know the world,\nAll gain and loss, all joy and pain,\nAll good and ill repute, all praise and blame:\nThese eight mundane concerns are not\nthe worthy objects of your mind.\nIf an examination is made on the level of ultimate truth, the question arises: Who is the person craving and\nwhat is it that is craved? Neither has inherent existence. Since this world of living beings, if we consider well,\nhas no real existence, who can ever be said to die who lives therein? Who will ever be born in the next life,\nand who was ever born in the past? Who, moreover, are our friends, and who our dear relations?\nLet those who, like the wise master Shantideva, investigate the\nnature of things fully understand that all phenomena are like space and elude the conceptual categories of\n\"is\" and \"is not:' Let them regard as equal the eight mundane concerns.\n~ Khenpo Kunzang Pelden, in \"Nectar of Manjushri's Speech”\n1304\nEntering the Marketplace, Actualizing Daily Life\n“Many people translate the fetter of conceit as 'pride', however, the fetter of conceit is not just in the\nsense of being 'proud'. I mean, pride etc is definitely a fetter. But also some people can be very humble,\nyet it does not mean they have overcome their 'I Am conceit'.\nThe 'I Am conceit' is more specifically described as a kind of trace, like a stench left over in a jug when the\ncontents of the jug has been poured away. That trace of self remains after realization of anatta and then\none has to liberate even that trace itself. That liberation of trace is Arahantship. This is clearly described in\nthe Khemaka Sutta.\nThe Buddha said: Blissful is passionlessness in the world, The overcoming of sensual desires (i.e.\nanagami); But the abolition of the conceit \"I am\" (i.e. arahantship) — That is truly the supreme bliss.\nAlso, the Buddha said:\n“The noble ones have seen as happiness\nThe ceasing of identity.\nThis [view] of those who clearly see\nRuns counter to the entire world.\n“What others speak of as happiness,\nThat the noble ones say is suffering;\nWhat others speak of as suffering,\nThat the noble one know as bliss.”\nSo what is the difference between the 'view of self' and the 'trace of self'?\nAs Thusness (John Tan) wrote to me in 2011:\n“Thusness: if you do not feel the 'body construct' and 'mind construct', just the play of dharma, how does\nthe sense of self arise?\nAEN: It doesn’t\nThusness: yeah… for me, it is just this dependent originated activity… primordially pure and luminous.\nsense of self does not arise.

His girlfriend joked that he might be\nbecoming a monk. I told him that besides the daily sitting meditation (which is very important even after\nanatman realization, let alone before - https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/12/how-silent-\nmeditation-helped-me-with.html), practice is mostly and very much in daily life and engagement rather\nthan in some remote region in the mountains, it is about living a life in the marketplace that is\nspontaneously beneficial for oneself and others around, and joyful, rather than one that is miserable. It is\nfully engaged and free.\nZen Master Bernie Glassman said,\n“At its deepest, most basic level, Zen—or any spiritual path, for that matter—is much more than a list of\nwhat we can get from it. In fact, Zen is the realization of the oneness of life in all its aspects. It’s not just\nthe pure or “spiritual” part of life: it’s the whole thing. It’s flowers, mountains, rivers, streams, and the\ninner city and homeless children on Forty-second Street. It’s the empty sky and the cloudy sky and the\nsmoggy sky, too. It’s the pigeon flying in the empty sky, the pigeon shitting in the empty sky, and walking\nthrough the pigeon droppings on the sidewalk. It’s the rose growing in the garden, the cut rose shining in\nthe vase in the living room, the garbage where we throw away the rose, and the compost where we throw\naway the garbage. Zen is life—our life. It’s coming to the realization that all things are nothing but\nexpressions of myself. And myself is nothing but the full expression of all things. It’s a life without limits.\nThere are many different metaphors for such a life. But the one that I have found the most useful, and\nthe most meaningful, comes from the kitchen. Zen masters call a life that is lived fully and completely,\nwith nothing held back, “the supreme meal.” And a person who lives such a life—a person who knows\nhow to plan, cook, appreciate, serve, and offer the supreme meal of life, is called a Zen cook.”\n“But why does a venerable elder such as yourself waste time doing the hard work of a head cook?” Dogen\npersisted. “Why don’t you spend your time practicing meditation or studying the words of the masters?”\nThe Zen cook burst out laughing, as if Dogen had said something very funny. “My dear foreign friend,” he\nsaid, “it’s clear you do not yet understand what Zen practice is all about. When you get the chance, please\ncome and visit me at my monastery so we can discuss these matters more fully.” And with that, he\ngathered up his mushrooms and began the long journey back to his monastery. Dogen did eventually\nvisit and study with the Zen cook in his monastery, as well as with many other masters. When he finally\n1307\nEntering the Marketplace, Actualizing Daily Life\nreturned to Japan, Dogen became a celebrated Zen master. But he never forgot the lessons he learned\nfrom the Zen cook in China.”\n- Zen Master Bernie Glassman” - Soh, 2019\n“In Zen, enlightenment implies full integration into activities. Any lack of such insight is not 'enlightenment\nin Zen'.” - John Tan, 2010\n“My daily activities are not unusual,\nI'm just naturally in harmony with them.\nGrasping nothing, discarding nothing,\nIn every place there's no hindrance, no conflict.\nWho assigns the ranks of vermilion and purple?\nThe hills' and mountains' last speck of dust\nis extinguished.\n[My] supernatural power and marvelous activity—\nDrawing water and carrying firewood.” - Layman Pang\nAn old Zen saying— “Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.

is not talking about the content aspect right?\n(12:57 AM) Thusness:\nyes. this is seeing without the content, without the extra layer and reification. then you realize that the\nobserver is assumed. it does not exist. then awareness is experienced as the manifestation that\ndependent originates. however that is different from dealing in daily world where we involved so much\ncontent and stories, so emotions continue to arise and even an experienced practitioner will not be able\nto apply this anatta insight till we realize the non-action is directly related to the gain/loss aspect\n(1:02 AM) AEN:\nic.. so is it right to say that after non action is realized those emotions don't manifest anymore?\n(1:03 AM) Thusness:\nthen we will experience the non-dual in content and realize that once we are free from gain/loss, we\nrealize it shares the 'same taste'. then realization will dawn. you can't say emotion will not arise just like\nyou can't say sound does not arise, or thought does not arise. you just realized that sound arises, but\nthere is no hearer\n(1:06 AM) Thusness:\nit is just the insight and you become free\nclear, vivid, present, non-dual, effortless and spontaneous,

AEN:\nbut you said dharma dan didn't know how to apply non action in engagement and hence he doesn't\nbelieve in emotional model, but does that mean after experiencing non action in content that means\nnegative emotions stop arising? since theres no gain or loss there wont be desire, anger etc rite?\n1311\nEntering the Marketplace, Actualizing Daily Life\n(1:09 AM) Thusness:\ni am not sure. :) coz i am not there yet lol\ni can only tell you there is a lacking of this insight. or at far as I can see, there is no clear insight on this\naspect yet. but there is clear insight on the anatta and DO but the application on the content level, i have\nnot seen yet. at the content level, especially as a businessman, I must constantly deal with it.\n(1:13 AM) AEN:\nso far have you seen any books that deal with this?\n(1:13 AM) Thusness:\nNope. many actually just treat this as a form of practice because Buddha said so. :P\nnot as a form of insight. but that is just my view\n(1:14 AM)

AEN:\nOic.. so non action is not a practice, is the application of DO insight on content?\n(1:16 AM) Thusness:\nu can't say so. i am just borrowing a taoist term for you to understand how to apply it at the content level.\nif i were to tell you DO, then it doesn't matter at all. but you will not gain the insight that it is two different\nlevel of practice and involve two different realizations\nSession Start: Friday, 11 September, 2009\n(3:38 PM) AEN:\ncan one experience nondual when engaged in contents?\n(3:54 PM) Thusness:\nfirst you must have the insight of anatta until you have vivid experience of non-dual effortlessly\notherwise you do not know what you are talking and discussing and what is meant by content\n(3:55 PM) AEN:\ncontent are just stories right. i have never experienced nondual when engaging in contents... only with\nbare sensations\n(3:57 PM) Thusness:\nwhen you are only at the very surface of your experience, you want to know experience that are even\nbeyond those advance practitioners, you will only mislead others and yourself. what you have to do is to\n'taste' non-dual first and then arise the insight of anatta till you are so clear what non-dual is about. then\nwhen you have content and realize that you do not have what sort of attachments, you have the same\nsort of experiences...and gradually you will mature your insight. there are certain sensations that come\nafter the maturing of anatta insight. you must be thoroughly clear first. when insight initially arises, I told\nyou it might not last more than 60-90 days before the tendencies step in, then it becomes ordinary like\n1312\nEntering the Marketplace, Actualizing Daily Life\nwhat longchen said. gradually it becomes effortless, spontaneous; completely without center and simply\nDO yet there are always content. then you understand DO better. when you meet life experiences and\nfaced all sorts of problems like dharma dan, you will arise this sort of question. how is insight of anatta\ngoing to be applied when there are stories. when we are engaged in worldly matters when we are in\ndreams. that requires very deep wisdom before you can really understand.\n(4:05 PM) AEN:\nOic.. i think i can remain a witnessing when thoughts arise but if very engaged in thoughts even that is\nlost, though i don’t think thats nondual with thoughts\n(4:07 PM) Thusness:\nthat is because you have not understood what anatta really mean and directly experienced the truth of it.\nwhen insight arises, you will know why it is effortless. yet after that, after 60-90 days, the tendency steps\nin. then you must be very clear of this tendency and understand it affects you. so mature your experience\nof non-dual and meditate on the stanza of what I have written in stage 4. so that insight of anatta may\narise. then go through life experiences, face all sorts of problems.\nlike what longchen is undergoing now and like revisit your insight of anatta and DO\n(4:12 PM)

Buddhahood is the fetter model plus elimination of the knowledge obscurations.\nThe implication is this: all unwholesome behaviours result from afflictions which are driven by self\ngrasping and ignorance. With the cessation of ignorance, the three poisons cease and the related\nbehaviours stop.\nWe see this in varying degrees in one’s practice and experience along the path. Afflictions do get reduced\nand removed. Hence it would not make sense to assert that the literal fetter model arahant does not\nexist.”\nThere is a teaching by Buddha on how to test if someone is an arahant:\nhttps://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato\nOn distinguishing the difference in attainment between an Arahat or Pratyekabuddha and a Buddha, the\nMahayana scripture Lankavatara Sutra states, “...Therefore, Mahamati, the assurances given to shravakas\nand bodhisattvas do not differ. Mahamati, what doesn’t differ is the taste of liberation when shravakas\nand pratyeka-buddhas or buddhas and tathagatas get rid of the obstruction of passion, not when they get\nrid of the obstruction of knowledge. Mahamati, the obstruction of knowledge is purified when they see\nthat dharmas have no self. The obstruction of passion is removed prior to this when they become\naccustomed to seeing that persons have no self. It is when the seventh consciousness ceases that they\n1315\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nare liberated from the obstruction of dharmas. And it is when the habit-energy of the repository\nconsciousness ceases that their purification is complete.”\n“[To attain Buddhahood], you must free [yourself] from 2 obscurations and 4 mara.” – John Tan, 2020\n“According to Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna there are two obscurations that prevent us from fully knowing the\nnature of phenomena. The first is called the afflictive obscuration, which is the fetter of an internal\nsubjective reference point that the self is attributed to, and the second is called the cognitive obscuration,\nwhich is everything else that stands apart from our deluded sense of self, so all objects; persons, places,\nthings.\nFor some reason these obscurations can be uprooted at different times.” – Kyle Dixon, 2021\nSomeone thought that Buddhahood is an athletic project. Soh replied, “Buddhahood is not an athletic\nproject but the elimination of the twin obscurations*. Several years ago, John Tan had a series of\nbreakthroughs and he told me he had very little knowledge obscurations left after that. (He is not\nclaiming some sort of finality) And that is over a decade after he wrote the 7 stages, etc. So there is plenty\nmore to unfold and anatta is just a beginning.\nAfter anatta, it will be good to look into this https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2023/08/compilation-of-\npost-anatta-advise.html and\nhttps://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Two_obscurations\nTwo obscurations (Tib. སབི ་པ་གཉིས་, dribpa nyi; Wyl. sgrib pa gnyis) — emotional and cognitive obscurations.\n● Emotional obscurations are defined according to their essence, cause and function.\nIn essence, they are the opposite of the six paramitas, as described in the Gyü Lama:\n\"Thoughts such as avarice and so on,\nThese are the emotional obscurations.\"\nTheir cause is grasping at a personal ego, or the “self of the individual”.\nThey function to prevent liberation from samsara.\n● Cognitive obscurations are also defined according to their essence, cause and function.\nIn essence, they are thoughts that involve the three conceptual ‘spheres’ of subject, object and action. The\nGyü Lama says:\n\"Thoughts that involve the three spheres,\nThese are the cognitive obscurations.\"\nTheir cause is grasping at phenomena as truly existent, or, in other words, the “self of phenomena”.\nTheir function is to prevent complete enlightenment.”\nOn the four maras,\n1316\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n“According to Sutrayana\n1. the mara of the aggregates (Skt. skandhamāra; Tib. ཕུང་པོའ་ིབདུད་, Wyl. phung po'i bdud), which\nsymbolizes our clinging to forms, perceptions, and mental states as ‘real’;\n2. the mara of the destructive emotions (Skt. kleśamāra; Tib. ཉོན་མོངས་ཀི་བདུད་, Wyl. nyon mongs kyi bdud),\nwhich symbolizes our addiction to habitual patterns of negative emotion;\n3. the mara of the Lord of Death (Skt. mṛtyumāra; Tib. འཆི་བདག་ག་ིབདུད་, Wyl. 'chi bdag gi bdud), which\nsymbolizes both death itself, which cuts short our precious human birth, and also our fear of\nchange, impermanence, and death; and\n4. the mara of the sons of the gods (Skt. devaputramāra; Tib. ལྷའི་བུའི་བདུད་, Wyl. lha'i bu'i bdud), which\nsymbolizes our craving for pleasure, convenience, and ‘peace’.\nThe Great Tibetan Dictionary gives the following descriptions:\n1. The mara of the aggregates prevents one from accomplishing virtue, since if one possesses the\naggregates (created by karma and destructive emotions), then one falls under the sway of\nsickness, aging and decay; the conditions preventing one from accomplishing virtue.\n2. The mara of the destructive emotions prevents one from accomplishing virtue, since one is under\nthe power of destructive emotions such as desire and anger. The coarse mara of the destructive\nemotions are the root and subsidiary destructive emotions. The subtle mara of the destructive\nemotions are for example the emotional habitual tendencies in the mind of an arhat.\n3. The mara of the Lord of Death causes one to be powerless regarding the ceasing of the life-force\nfaculty.\n4. The mara of the sons of the gods prevent one from accomplishing virtue through the jealousy of\nthe desire realm's sons of the gods. The coarse mara of the sons of the gods is Garab Wangchuk\n(kāmadeva), the lord of the realm Controlling Others' Emanations. The subtle mara of the sons of\nthe gods is for example distraction which makes one unable to overcome any of the first three\nmaras.” - https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_maras\n“Clearing intellectual obscurity actually requires quite some shamata concentration that enables the mind\nto see clearly experience and how the conceptual mind process in a slow motion. It is like anatta but\nmore complex issues are seen clearly in real time.\n...\nOne can be free from subject and object division in experience, but one may not be free from mind-\nmatter duality. There is intellectual mind/matter duality block despite experience being non-dual and\nanatta. Freedom from duality in experience does not mean you are free from mind/matter duality and\nthe relationship between them.” – John Tan, 2020\n“Now having non-dual experience or a state of no-mind does not mean finality. We must also free\nourselves from many more intellectual obscurations. other obscurations of cause. Like having non-dual\nor no-mind may not free on from the notion of self.

It is inside, it is also outside. It is private, it is also public.\nSo it is neither too.” – John Tan, 2020\n“Before anyone can hope to overcome emotional and mental afflictions or knowledge obscurations, they\nmust have given rise to all the insights in Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment , but this is\nnot the end, they must cultivate meditative equipoise and samadhi conjoined with insight and then tune\nthem up ever more until all traces of mental afflictions/kleshas/defilements are burned off in the light of\nprajna forever. See Buddha's teachings on this in https://becoming-buddha.com/yuganaddha-sutta-\ntranquility.../\nAdditionally, one must overcome the knowledge or cognitive obscurations that prevent omniscience or\nBuddhahood. The wisdom of twofold emptiness must be refined and deepened to the degree that all\ntraces of reifying phenomena, not only in terms of ‘subject’, ‘object’ and ‘action’, but also in terms of\narising, abiding and ceasing, in terms of cause and effect, characteristics of phenomena, internality and\nexternality, existence and non-existence of phenomena, and so on. Knowledge obscuration is overcome\nby the wisdom of the emptiness of all phenomena.\nThe realization of twofold emptiness marks the entry into the path of seeing, the first bhumi stage of\nBodhisattva path, but it is not the end -- Buddhahood, also known as the 11th, or 13th, or 16th bhumi\ndepending on the map. It is said that Arahants and 8th Bhumi bodhisattvas have overcome all traces of\nemotional afflictions, while a Buddha has additionally overcome all traces of knowledge obscuration. The\ngoal of AtR people here is generally Buddhahood (maybe some may opt for Arahantship depending on\nthe tradition they practice - anyone is entitled to their own choice or preference for the spiritual path they\nundertake)” – Soh, Buddhahood: The End of All Emotional/Mental Afflictions and Knowledge Obscurations\n\"No appearances just mean the conceptual notions of mind, appearances and external objects are all\ndeconstructed.

For the Consequentialists, a consciousness conceiving inherent existence is the\nchief affliction; thus, no matter what phenomenon is held to exist inherently - a person or a cup - any\nconsciousness conceiving inherent existence is an affliction and must be removed in order to gain\nfreedom from cyclic existence.\nIn the Middle Way Autonomy School, however, a consciousness conceiving true existence is an\nobstruction to omniscience; as such, it has to be removed in order to attain Buddhahood, but not for\nliberation from cyclic existence. According to Autonomists, the chief among the obstructions to liberation\nis a consciousness conceiving the person to be a self-sufficient, substantially existent entity. Therefore,\nthey hold that liberation is a consciousness conceiving the person to be a self-sufficient, substantially\nexistent entity. Therefore, they hold that liberation from cyclic existence is achieved through cognizing\nand becoming accustomed to the person's not being an entity able to stand by itself. Consequentialists\ndisagree, saying that in order to be liberated from cyclic existence it is necessary to cognize both persons\nand other phenomena as being without inherent or true existence. For them, conceptions of both\npersons and other phenomena as existing inherently are instances of afflictions binding one in cyclic\nexistence.\nJang-gya presents positions of the Mind Only School and the Autonomy School that are contrary to the\nConsequence School...

It is not exactly the six and fifth bodhisattva\nbhumi. Here is another passage which clarifies things:\nIt is talking about equivalent stages of the eradication of afflictions in this case.\nOther than the view of the abhisamaya of the śravakas abandoning fully the afflictions on the sixth or fifth\nstage, the latent afflictions are not abandoned and they have inconceivable deaths and transmigrations. They\nproclaim My births are finished, I abide in brahmacarya, my work is finished\", uttering the lion's roar. Having\nsaid that, after they become throughly familiar with the absence of self in persons, their minds turn a period of\nnirvana.\nWhat is here being stated is that that śravakas abandonment of active afflictions is equivalent to that of\nthe fifth or sixth bhumi, but that they do not abandon latent afflictions and are thus subject to\ninconceivable deaths and transmigrations.\nAnother section, dealing with bhumis, states:\nBeginning with the sixth stage, bodhisattva mahasattvas, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas enter into the\nconcentration on cessation. On the seventh stage, mental moment by mental moment, the bodhisattva\nmahāsattvas enter into a concentration that eliminates the characteristics of all things, but the śrāvakas and\npratyekabuddhas do not. The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas' concentration on cessation falls into the\ncharacteristics of an apprehended object and apprehending subject through possession of ideation. That being\nthe case, if the characteristic of the absence of the different dharma's they obtain and the characteristic of\ndiversity were to become non-existent, it would not be proper — on the seventh bhumi one is to concentrate on\none mental moment after another. They enter into concentration without comprehending the intrinsic\n1325\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\ncharacteristic of the virtue and nonvirtue of all phenomena. That being the case, such a one who enters into\nconcentration is not skilled in entering into concentration on one mind moment after another.\nThe point is the comparison with the concentrations, abandonments and so on of śravakas and\npratyekabuddhas with bodhisattvas on the stages. It is not an assertion that śravakas and\npratyekabuddhas are traversing the stages.\n· Reply\n· 1m”\nMore related posts and not so related posts:\n“[5:05 PM, 5/24/2020] John Tan: But I think need to be very careful not to assume that non-dual of\nsubject/object naturally implies freedom from intellectual obscurations of internal/external, mind/matter.\n[5:30 PM, 5/24/2020] John Tan: Yes no self and seeing through background, may not necessarily lead to\ndissolving of physicality obscuration, even then there are different level of clearing.\n[5:30 PM, 5/24/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic..\n[5:31 PM, 5/24/2020] John Tan: But no self will almost definitely result in pce.

In the lower tenet of the great exposition and\nsutra systems, they are very careful not to fall into the extremes of annihilation. When you get up the ladder be\nit yogacara, middle way up to Dzogchen and mahamudra, it is imo just a matter of refining the view of\nselflessness with direct experiential insights but still a sort of \"middle path\" from top to bottom...nvr a skewed\ntowards the extreme of annihilation.\nJohn TanWednesday, January 28, 2015 at 12:25pm UTC+08\nCessation is imp and once cessation is actualized, attachment to experiences of whatever samadhi is \"cool\ndown\", so any form of promotion towards annihilation is unnecessary and extra (imo). Even shutting down of\nsenses into an oblivious state is not exactly an extraordinary state, we enter in deep sleep every night anyway.\nThe seeing through of any form of experience as dis-satisfactory that led to the direct taste of dispassion, dis-\nidentification and atammayata should be the focus. Peace and liberation is directly related to this taste, so is\nthe non-arisen of dharma. This is a state of evenness, calm and peace...and consciousness as well as senses can\ncome to a shut down. Shutting down is not a secret or some exalted state for one that has gone through deep\nletting go in meditation but the cause that let one into it is. Anyway that is just my opinion.\n...\nJohn TanMonday, January 26, 2015 at 8:36am UTC+08\nYou must also understand a state of oblivion like deep sleep too is a landing ground, an escape into the\ncessation of experience. A movement from experience into non-experience and therefore it is driven by the same\ncause. It is not extinguishing the cause. The cessation is not to be understood as a shut down of senses and\nconsciousness but disenchantment and dispassion that led to the ending of grasping. The mind no more chases\nanything and everything settles down, gone cool and is seen to be in a state of rest and peace.\nJohn TanMonday, January 26, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+08\n1330\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nBut it can and will lead to the shut down of senses and consciousness like deep sleep which is a natural\nconsequent.

As such even non-arising nature is understood analytically, it is not appropriately\ntasted. There are blissful experience but there is no peace and there is no liberation without 寂. As for 万法无\n生，本自寂静 (all dharmas are non-arising, fundamentally quiescent) is a realization.

After anatta the sense of\nself/Self is realized to be fabrication and the entire chain of afflictive D.O. [dependent origination] can come to a\nrest by seeing how stressful, dis-satisfying and suffering the chain is. That is right intention in the Noble Eightfold\nPath. Taste this afflictive D.O. coming to rest in relation to the need to maintain the Self/self or beingness. When\nthe mind let go this way seeing the dis-satisfactoriness... it is by way of renunciation, dispassion, dis-\nidentification… the freedom and bliss that come from Atammayata is the bliss of cessation (寂灭为乐), it is\nunderstood to be many times more blissful than any form of pleasure and beingness. However cutting the cause\nof suffering at root in Mahayana is about seeing the emptiness of self and phenomena. The bliss of cessation of\nthe Theravadins are replaced by tasting the non-arising of phenomena therefore 观法如化，三昧常寂, 见闻觉\n知，本自圆寂。（contemplating all dharmas as illusory, [always in] samadhi-quiescence, seen-heard-cognized-\nsensed, are by nature completely quiescent [nirvana])” - Soh, 2020\nSince I (Soh) have not experienced the slightest trace of subject/object duality and agency for the past 9+\nyears [at the time of writing in 2020] after the realization of anatta, and John Tan has likewise explicitly\ntold me that he has not experienced the slightest trace of subject/object duality and agency for 20+ years\n(he realised anatta in 1997 and overcame the trace of background in a year or so), we will certainly qualify\nunder Daniel Ingram’s definition of ‘arahant’. However, whether Daniel’s definition of arahantship\ncorresponds to the scriptural/sutta’s fetter model of arahant is not so clear.\nNow, if anatta realization is able to remove all subject/object agent/action, what remains after that\nrealization? Why can't it be called arahantship?\nIn fact for many people, after the anatta realization including myself, we generally see mental afflictions\nbeing severed.\nAs Kyle Dixon also said and likewise for his teacher Malcolm,\nKyle dixon: \"...The anatta definitely severed many emotional afflictions, for the most part I don't have\nnegative emotions anymore. And either the anatta or the strict shamatha training has resulted in stable\nshamatha where thoughts have little effect and are diminished by the force of clarity. I'm also able to\ncontrol them, stopping them for any amount of desired time etc. But I understand that isn't what is\nimportant. Can I fully open to whatever arises I would say yes. I understand that every instance of\nexperience is fully appearing to itself as the radiance of clarity, yet timelessly disjointed and\nunsubstantiated..\" - Kyle Dixon, 2013\n1332\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nSome people have all traces of afflictions completely removed upon realization such as bahiya, meaning\nthey skipped the process of stream entry to anagami and simply realized arahantship at the first instance\nof realization. but 99% of practitioners aren't instantaneous like these\nfor example one of the local practitioners pam tan who realised anatta a few years ago reported even\nmore surfacing of afflictions very much the same way that you warned me might happen after anatta\ninsight, but the difference now is that whereas it was deep depression and suffering before, now they just\nburn up in an intense way and self liberates but without causing real suffering and depression, so in a\nway it is very freeing -\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/03/pam-tans-anatta-realisation-and-purging.html\nEven after these conditionings are purged, we do not necessarily call it arahant. Arahant would be\ncompletely free of any traces of clinging and appropriation, not even the slightest trace of clinging that\narise for even 1 second can happen to a true arahant. Someone who experiences clinging and affliction\nthat self-liberate, even that cannot be considered arahant. An arahant simply do not have clinging or the\nslightest trace of afflictions at all, having cut them off from its roots as buddha put it, made like a palmyra\nstump, deprived of the conditions of development, etc.\n“Buddha: \"Passion is a trouble; aversion is a trouble; delusion is a trouble.

As the sutra explained, habitual obscurations are exceedingly subtle like\nscent left behind a container hence there is no short-cut to liberation -- it’s all step by step and bit by bit\nerosion of the nuances and subtleness of “inherentness” in one’s ignorance.” – John Tan, Connecting dots,\nauthenticating DO\nAn arahant in the suttas cannot be a lay person that owns money (Buddha said arahants cannot store up\npossessions, and all recorded arahants in scriptures that awakened as a lay person became a monk/nun\non that very day by choice or died on that very day by accident, in contrast to the thousands of monks,\nnuns and laypersons that were at the stages of stream entry, once-returner and non-returner), and\nvarious other implications. Daniel may think these are myths but since it is what the Buddha said in the\nnine things an Arahant cannot do*, I personally do not describe myself as an ‘Arahant’ or a ‘Buddha’.\n*The Nine things an Arahant cannot do: 1. Store up possessions, 2. Intentionally kill any form of life, 3. Steal,\n4. Perform sexual intercourse, 5. Tell a deliberate lie, 6. Act improperly out of desire, 7. Act improperly out of ill-\nwill, 8. Act improperly out of delusion, 9. Act improperly out of fear (from Anguttara Nikaya 9.7)\nThe Buddha also said that the fetter of householdership must be abandoned for complete liberation:\n“When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta asked the Blessed One: \"Master Gotama, is there any\nhouseholder who, without abandoning the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has made\nan end of suffering?\"\n\"Vaccha, there is no householder who, without abandoning the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of\nthe body has made an end of suffering.\"” - MN 71\nMahanama, there is still a state un-abandoned by you internally, owing to which at times states of greed, hate\nand delusion invade your mind and remain; for were that state already abandoned by you internally you would\n1335\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nnot be living the home life, you would not be enjoying sensual pleasures. It is because that state is un-\nabandoned by you internally that you are living the home life and enjoying sensual pleasures.\n- MN 14\nThere are these ten fetters. Which ten? Five lower fetters & five higher fetters. And which are the five lower\nfetters? Self-identification views, uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices, sensual desire, & ill will. These are\nthe five lower fetters. And which are the five higher fetters? Passion for form, passion for what is formless,\nconceit, restlessness, & ignorance. These are the five higher fetters. And these are the ten fetters.\n- AN 10:13\n(Notes: Terminating the fetter of self-identification views, uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices =\nstream enterer [sotapanna], attenuating sensual desire, & ill will = once returner [sakadagami],\nterminating sensual desire, & ill will = non returner [anagami], terminating all ten fetters including the\nremaining five higher fetters passion for form, passion for what is formless, conceit, restlessness, &\nignorance, = sainthood/conqueror [arahant])\nMN73 describes more than five hundred laymen and more than five hundred laywomen stream enterers\nthat enjoys sensual pleasure, more than five hundred laymen and more than five hundred laywomen non\nreturners although with no mention of partaking in sensual pleasures (implying they do not), more than\nfive hundred monks and more than five hundred nuns that are arahants with no mention of lay ones.\nNotice that in that sutta, 1) only monks and nuns are arahants, 2) only monks and nuns, and Celibate\nlaymen and women are anagamis (because they are incapable of enjoying sensual pleasures or engage in\nthem), 3) there are monks and nuns plus laymen and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures of the stream\nentry and sakadagami category. Each category of awakening is by the thousands. Thousands of Buddha’s\nstudents attained awakening. The numbers that realise after encountering AtR is nothing compared to\nthe number of Buddha’s students attaining awakening in his lifetime (also, the Mahamudra teachings has\na similar situation back in the olden days, “Half the people are Drukpas, half the Drukpas are mendicant\nbeggars, and half the mendicants are siddhas.” – Khamtrul Rinpoche), just to make it clear that awakening\nhappening often is not something particularly special but should be the norm for any effective system or\nteaching of awakening.\nI know we live in modern times and when comparing to ancient times you may have doubts, because why\naren’t these huge numbers present now? Could those numbers be completely made up and imagined by\nsome writers? In my opinion, as Angelo Dillulo (Angelo Gerangelo) said, he thinks we are reaching a point\nwhere spiritual awakening is about to go mainstream. We soon will get to those numbers, no doubt. Just\nbecause where was a gap where these numbers occur doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened before. It’s like\nthe moon landing – how come there wasn’t a human moon landing from the 1970s to present day? The\ntechnology back then was so much worse comparably, and yet nobody is landing on the moon nowadays,\nand efforts to restart the moon mission is taking up so much time and effort? Some people prone to\nbelieving in conspiracy theories will start to talk about the moon landing hoax, they think it’s all made up\ndue to the America vs Soviet rivalry back in the 1960s, that we never really made it to the moon at all. It’s\nall just Hollywood movie effects in a studio, they say, citing apparent anomalies in the directions of\nshadows on photographs and so on. But based on what I researched, I don’t think that’s the case.\nAnyway, conspiracies on such a large scale is just very, incredibly difficult to sustain without some kind of\nevidence leak. I don’t think it’s a conspiracy. It just so happens that the whole “going to moon movement”\n1336\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\ndied out, served its purpose, and people lost interest along the way. Same goes for the spiritual\nawakening movement. The whole movement of spiritual awakening back in Buddha’s time died out.\nThere was a whole fad on spiritual awakening for a while, but eventually new things that excite the\npopulation came up. Eventually people became engrossed in the industrial and scientific revolution and\neconomic growth and materialism in recent centuries until recently, we realized the meaninglessness and\nspiritual void in the midst of it all, despite its obvious benefits to our quality of life. Then we’re back on the\nspiritual quest again as a civilization. And, right about time too, because that might be the only one thing\nthat can save us from worldwide climate apocalypse due to selfishness, greed and ignorance. That’s my\ntheory, anyway.\nSpiritual awakening is like studying and graduating from university. Is graduating from university easy?\nNot necessarily, you need to put time and effort to it. Is graduating from university close to impossible?\nFar from it, people graduate from university all the time by the bucketload. Likewise if you truly set your\nwill and intention for liberation and work on it with diligence (or the three greats of Zen - great doubt,\ngreat faith, great determination), there is no reason you cannot break through. The myth that\nenlightenment is reserved for the rare elite is simply just that - a myth, and a myth increasingly proven\nfalse with increasing open access to information and the advent of the internet, where more and more\nordinary people like myself are revealing their own spiritual awakening. Books like “three pillars of zen”\nalso showcase many examples of ordinary folks attaining kensho or satori.\nBut even this is just an imperfect analogy, why? You need some degree of smartness to graduate from\nuniversity, it is not all hard work. But liberation is possible even if you are uneducated, or are intellectually\ndull witted.\nPadmasambhava taught in Self-Liberation through Seeing with Naked Awareness in English & Chinese\n(great text!):\n“Just as is the case with the sesame seed being the cause of the oil and the milk being the cause of butter,\nBut where the oil is not obtained without pressing and the butter is not obtained without churning,\nSo all sentient beings, even though they possess the actual essence of Buddhahood,\nWill not realize Buddhahood without engaging in practice.\nIf he practices, then even a cowherd can realize liberation.\nEven though he does not know the explanation, he can systematically establish himself in the\nexperience of it.\n(For example) when one has had the experience of actually tasting sugar in one's own mouth,\none does not need to have that taste explained by someone else.\nNot understanding this (intrinsic awareness), even Panditas can fall into error.\nEven though they are exceedingly learned and knowledgeable in explaining the nine vehicles,\nit will only be like spreading rumors of places, which they have not seen personally.\nAnd with respect to Buddhahood, they will not even approach it for a moment.”\nIn the Pali canon too, there was a record of a dull witted man who nevertheless attained arahantship:\n\"When Mahāpanthaka discovered his brother’s stupidity, he asked him to leave the Order (see\nDhA.iv.190 f), but Cūḷapanthaka so loved the Buddha’s teaching that he did not wish to return to the lay-\nlife. One day Jīvaka Komārabhacca, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, asked\n1337\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nMahāpanthaka, who was acting as steward, to collect all the monks in the monastery. This he did,\nomitting only Cūḷapanthaka who, he said, had made no progress in the Doctrine. Greatly grieved,\nCūḷapanthaka determined to leave the Order, but as he was going out the Buddha met him, took him into\nthe Gandhakuṭi and comforted him, giving him a clean piece of cloth. “Sit with your face to the East,” said\nthe Buddha, “repeat the words ‘Removing the dirt’ (rajoharanaṃ) and wipe your face with the cloth.” As\nCūḷapanthaka carried out these instructions he noticed that the cloth became dirty, and as he\nconcentrated his mind on the impermanence of all things, the Buddha sent a ray of light and exhorted\nhim about the necessity of getting rid of the impurities of lust and other evils. At the end of the\nadmonition Cūḷapanthaka attained Arahantship with the four paṭisambhidā, which included knowledge of\nall the Piṭakas.\" - http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/culapanthaka_thera.html , also\nhttps://legacy.suttacentral.net/en/thag10.4\nLikewise, age is not a hindrance to awakening. I awakened to anatta at the age of 20. But that is no where\nclose to record breaking. In the suttas, two arahants were 7 years old when they attained\narahantship. So never underestimate young practitioners, they can realise and attain the various stages\nof awakening as much as an old practitioner can attain them. The lack or presence of life experiences and\ngrowing wisdom, intellect and IQ, so on and so forth are not necessarily indicative of their spiritual\nwisdom. Those are different axis of development.\nNow, back to discussing MN73: No anagamis or arahants are said to enjoy sensual pleasures, unlike\nstream enterer and once returners.\nAn anagami and arahant would have no desires or clinging to a relationship either. An anagami simply\nasked whether his wifes want to leave and he could arrange it, and didn’t have issues either way. Didn’t\nfelt sad or perturbed that they are leaving either. I read that some anagamis remain as lay persons (in the\nsuttas) as they need to take care of parents and so on.\nAs someone wrote, “As for lifestyle changes upon abandoning the five fetters, this is what the non-\nreturner Ugga has to say: “I had four young wives. I then went to them and said: ‘Sisters, I have\nundertaken the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. If you want, you can enjoy wealth right here and\ndo merits, or go back to your own family circle, or inform me if you want me to give you over to another\nman.’ My eldest wife then said to me: ‘Young sir, give me to such and such a man.’ I sent for that man, and\nwith my left hand I took my wife, with my right hand I took the ceremonial vase, and I gave her to that\nman. But even while giving away my young wife, I don’t recall that any alteration took place in my mind.\nThis is the third astounding and amazing quality found in me.”\nBy logical conjecture and inference informed by practice, I am inclined to think that it is possible that at a\nlater phase of one’s practice, the power of complete disenchantment and dispassion can lead a\npractitioner to actually renouncing the lay life. Without the slightest grasping or craving for sensual\nenjoyment, attachment to someone in a relationship, and fanciful possessions, wouldn’t it make more\nsense to renounce and be a monk or nun than remain a layperson? It would therefore not be very\naccurate to portray to others that one has attained the Buddha’s ideal of full awakening (even according\nto the standards of the early Buddhist traditions like Theravada, let alone the later Mahayana traditions\n1338\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nwhich takes what they consider to be an even higher attainment - Buddhahood - as their final aim), while\nnot fully meeting the ten fetter model or the nine things an arahant cannot do criterias that the Buddha\ntaught.\nI know of a western dharma teacher with quite a number of students. He is an ex-monk. He claims to\nhave attained the traditional ten fetter model arahantship (this teacher is not Daniel M. Ingram of course,\nif you haven’t been reading attentively), and he does seem to have realisation of anatta (although that\ndoes not mean I completely agree with the view he espoused, particularly with regards to his\ninterpretation of dependent origination), and yet he remains a lay person (by storing up possessions,\nwhich a layperson must do to survive [unless the person is living in a foraging lifestyle, and I grant that as\nanother possibility/exception, however other suttas also said that the fetter of householdership must be\nabandoned for liberation, so that pretty much seems to assert that renunciation of home life is a kind of\nsurety for arahants], this contradicts the 9 things the arahant cannot do) and his interpretation is that one\ncan still have sex (again, contradicts the 9 things the arahant cannot do) without sensual desires, which\ncontradicts what the Buddha said - \"Bhikkhus, that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual\ndesires, without perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of sensual desire—that is impossible.\"\n(Alagaddūpama Sutta) So even in such cases, it does not really meet the traditional criterias and seems to\nbe at odds with Buddha’s view, and again does not go beyond sakadagami based on strict fetter model\ninterpretations (even anagamis no longer engage in sensual pleasures according to the scriptures, in\nother words all traditional anagamis and arahants were celibates without exceptions). I have read his\ndocuments before, and the way he describe the cessation of the 8th fetter, it is no different to what I have\nalready experienced in October 2010. Furthermore I am also generally free from negative emotions and\nthe five poisons. In other words, I would also qualify as an arahant under his definition. But I am still not\nconvinced that his version of arahantship is similar to Buddha’s version of arahantship.\nAlso, a certain Thai monk of the modern era self-proclaimed to be an arahant. He too claims to have\neliminated all cravings and fetters, although his insight is of the level of one mind (still holding eternalist\nview despite the collapse of Witness into nondual awareness, and I am not the sole person making such a\ncritique - Ven. Dhammanando made similar comments in the Dhammawheel forum), so I am not\nconvinced that he fully meets the Buddha’s criterias for arahantship, however this is another practitioner I\nhave great respect for. It should be noted that despite my being unconvinced of his claim to arahantship,\nthis does not mean that his claim to the elimination of fetters was completely bunk. Likewise, John Tan\nand I have great respect to certain non-Buddhist sages like Ramana Maharshi, as they too have certain\nmeditative mastery. As the Buddha has pointed out, even the various adherents of other religions [which\nwould certainly include those holding eternalist views/being at the stages of I AM and one mind, etc] can\nalso achieve certain levels of purity, only with the exception of completely relinquishing all\ndoctrines/views/sense of Self which is the hallmark of the Buddhadharma - Cula-sihanada Sutta (MN 11) --\nThe Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar {M I 63} [Ñanamoli Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans.] -\nhttp://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.011.ntbb.html , the Buddha declares that only through\n1339\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\npracticing in accord with the Dhamma can Awakening be realized. His teaching is distinguished from those of\nother religions and philosophies through its unique rejection of all doctrines of self. [BB]\n“As I told you already, my Guru showed me my true nature -- and the true nature of the world.\nHaving realized that I am one with, and yet beyond the world, I became free from all desire\nand fear. I did not reason out that I should be free -- I found myself free -- unexpectedly,\nwithout the least effort. This freedom from desire and fear remained with me since then.\nThe main change was in the mind; it became motionless and silent, responding quickly, but\nnot perpetuating the response. Spontaneity became a way of life, the real became natural and\nthe natural became real.”\n- Advaitin sage Nisargadatta in his book I AM THAT\nMaharaj: “The common things of life: I experience them just as you do. The difference lies in what I\ndo not experience. I do not experience fear or greed, hate or anger. I ask nothing, refuse nothing,\nkeep nothing. In these matters I do not compromise. Maybe this is the outstanding difference\nbetween us. I will not compromise, I am true to myself, while you are afraid of reality.”\n…\nQuestioner: “When you say clear and empty, what do you mean?”\nMaharaj: “I mean free of all contents. To myself I am neither perceivable or conceivable; there is\nnothing I can point out and say: ‘this I am’. You identify yourself with everything so easily; I find it\nimpossible. The feeling: ‘I am not this or that, nor is anything mine’ is so strong in me that as soon\nas a thing or a thought appears, there comes at once the sense ‘this I am not’.”\n— I Am That, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, 1973\nUnlike Daniel, I hold that the overcoming of ten fetters of the Pali canon in a rather literal way is truly\nattainable, as well as open to the possibility that the overcoming of the emotional and cognitive\nobscurations of the Mahayana model, is also possible. You should know that the Pali canon and early\nscriptures recorded not just one or two arahants that attained that state in the Buddha’s sangha. There\nwere more than a thousand, or perhaps thousands of arahants in the Buddha’s community that attained\nthe state of arahantship (and also thousands who attained the state of sotapanna, sakadagami and\nanagami) while the Buddha was teaching. If so many people (presuming that the scriptures weren't\ncompletely making these figures up) attained the traditional ‘arahantship’, then surely, there must be\ntruth to it? Or were the thousand(s) of arahants all completely mistaken about exactly what their own\nattainment entails? If the ten fetter model didn’t apply to them completely, wouldn’t at least some of the\nthousand(s) arahants have noticed it, spoken up at the great historical Buddhist councils and said “Hey\n1340\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\narahant brothers & sisters, did you guys notice something’s off with this ten fetter model? Oh yeah, we all\ndid, too! Arahat 1 still had sexual fantasies! Arahat 2 still had cravings for jhanas! Arahat 3 was still\nrestless! Something’s definitely wrong here, arahat guys and gals. Maybe we should really just sit down\nand review it together, shall we, in this Great Buddhist Council #99” All I’m saying is, just perhaps, we\nshould at least keep our minds open?\nThat is not to say that I do not think the Buddhist traditions do not clearly have the mythical element to it\nas do all religious traditions in the world (despite being much less prevalent than in the Abrahamic\nreligions, and certainly not crucial to its core doctrines and transformative power since Buddhism is not\nso much about dogmas and far more about direct experience and wisdom), for example the Mahayana\nand Tibetan tradition and maps do have a strong element that is clearly mythical, as Daniel Ingram wrote\nin The Bodhisattva Bhumi Model - and even the earliest traditions, the Pali canon contains things that I\nfind to be clearly mythical (for example, that humans once lived to eighty thousand years old, or the\ntheory of devolution, etc, which contradicts what we know in the modern age to be factual, e.g. Darwinian\nevolution). One should of course try to separate the myths from reality, as John Tan also pointed out in\nWhat is an Authentic Buddhist Teaching?. In any case, realistically speaking, at least in this day and age, I\ndo think John Tan’s wisdom is pretty clear and complete on the insight front -- as John Tan told me in\n2007, “to me and from my point of view, it [the John Tan stages] is fairly thorough and beyond that, I think\nonly you can find in sutra or fairy tales. :P” That being said, John Tan has made many breakthroughs since\nhe wrote the 7 stages in terms of clearing the two obscurations (afflictive and knowledge obscurations),\nso it should not be mistaken that the realization of 7 stages represents some kind of finality. The\nrealization of emptiness may be definitive and sudden, but the elimination of two obscurations is gradual.\nAnd as for the Mahayana model, the Lankavatara and other Mahayana Sutras state that the sixth/eighth\nbhumi bodhisattva is equivalent to the arahat in terms of eliminating all emotional\nobscurations/passions, while the remnant cognitive obscurations are eliminated at the end of the tenth\nbhumi, after which one attains Buddhahood. The bhumis 1 to 7 are ‘impure bhumis’ because those\nbodhisattvas have not overcome afflictions completely, but the bhumis from 8 onwards are ‘pure\nbhumis’.\n“There are basically five paths and ten stages. Paths measure realizations, stages measure qualities.\nThere are also four kinds of realized persons, which are in fact measures of liberation from latent\nafflictions. The measure of full liberation is an arhat, pratyekabuddha, or an eighth stage bodhisattva,\nbecause only arhats, pratyekabuddhas and eighth stage bodhisattvas on up are free from birth in the\nthree realms. However, the difference between the former two and the latter are the qualities cultivated\non the path and the depth of realization. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not necessarily realize the\nemptiness of phenomena, and they do not necessarily comprehend the nonarising of phenomena.” –\nDzogchen Teacher Acarya Malcolm Smith\n1341\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nHere’s a quote on Jamgon Mipam’s explanations of the bhumis (one of John Tan’s favourite Tibetan\nauthors along with others like Tsongkhapa):\n\"PATHS TO ENLIGHTENMENT\nWhat follows is a short explanation of the way Mipam presents the structure of the Buddhist path to\nawakening. According to him, we can only go so far in the Lesser Vehicle, realizing the lack of a personal\nself based on its path, but without the Great Vehicle, we will not come to fully realize the lack of self (that\nis, emptiness) with respect to all phenomena. In other words, those in the Lesser Vehicle realize only part\nof emptiness (the lack of a personal self) but do not realize the entire scope of emptiness. They hang on\nto an ultimate foundation of reality (the fundamental elements of reality, or dharmas), whereas there is\nactually no such foundation. Therefore, according to Mipam, one cannot become a buddha based solely\non the Lesser Vehicle path; becoming a buddha is the result of the Great Vehicle. Nevertheless, realizing\nthe lack of a personal self is enough to free us from samsara, because in doing so, we relinquish the\nobscurations of the afflictive emotions. The afflictive emotions can be included within the “three poisons”\nof attachment, aversion, and delusion.\nThese afflictive obscurations function to prevent liberation, and they are tied in with the apprehension of\na personal self. Based on the notion of such a self, we become attached (to me and mine) and averse (to\nwhat is other). This notion of self keeps the wheel of samsara rolling, because it perpetuates the distorted\nframework through which we selfishly act out attachment and aversion, thus sowing the seeds of\nsuffering. Afflictive obscurations have two aspects: a gross, imputed aspect and a more subtle, innate\naspect. According to Mipam, the imputed aspects are relinquished on the first “ground” (Tib. sa, Skt.\nbhūmi) when you directly perceive the suchness of reality. This experiential realization is called “the path\nof seeing.”\nThe imputed aspects of the afflictive obscurations are learned and not inborn like the innate aspects.\nImputed aspects involve distortions that are explicitly conceptual, as opposed to the perceptual\ndistortions that comprise the innate aspects. The difference between the imputed and innate aspects can\nbe understood as something like the difference between software and hardware: the innate aspects are\nembedded more deeply in one’s mind-stream and are thus more difficult to eliminate. Imputed ego-\nclinging refers to imputing qualities to the self that are not there—namely, apprehending the self as a\nsingular, permanent, and independent entity. This is overcome on the first bodhisattva ground in a direct,\nnonconceptual experience of reality that is the culminating insight of analysis. Nevertheless, the more\nsubtle, innate aspect of ego-clinging hangs on.\nThe innate ego-clinging, as the bare sense of self that is imputed on the basis of the five aggregates, is\nmore difficult to remove. Rather than construing qualities to the self such as singularity or permanence, it\nis a more subtle feeling of simply “I am” when, for instance, we wake up in the morning. This innate sense\nof self is a deeply rooted, instinctual habit. It thus involves more than just imputed identity; it is a deeper\n1342\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nexperiential orientation of distorted subjectivity. Although analysis into the nature of the self paves the\nway for it to be overcome, it cannot fall away by analysis alone. Rather, it has to be relinquished through\ncultivating the path of meditation. According to Mipam, there are no innate aspects of the afflictive\nobscurations left on the eighth ground. However, the afflictive emotions are only one of two types of\nobscurations, the other being cognitive obscurations.\nCognitive obscurations are nothing less than conceptuality: the threefold conceptualization of agent,\nobject, and action. Conceptuality is tied in to apprehending a self of phenomena, which includes\nmistaking phenomena as real, objectifying phenomena, and simply perceiving dualistically. Such\nconceptualization serves to obstruct omniscience. Based on the Great Vehicle, these cognitive\nobscurations can be completely relinquished; thereby, the result of the Great Vehicle path culminates in\nnot merely escaping samsara, as in the Lesser Vehicle, but in becoming an omniscient buddha. According\nto Mipam, up to the seventh ground, the realization (of the twofold selflessness) and abandonment (of\nthe twofold obscurations) are the same in the Great and Lesser Vehicles.\nAs with the Great Vehicle, he maintains that accomplishing the path of the Lesser Vehicle entails the\nrealization of the selflessness of phenomena, to see that phenomena are empty. Those who accomplish\nthe Lesser Vehicle path also realize the selflessness of phenomena, because their realization of emptiness\nwith respect to a person is one instance of realizing the emptiness of phenomena. The final realization of\nthe Lesser Vehicle path, however, is incomplete. Mipam compares it to taking a small gulp of the water of\nthe ocean: we can say that those who realize emptiness in the Lesser Vehicle have drunk the water of the\nocean, just not all of it.150 The final realization of the bodhisattva’s path in the Great Vehicle, however, is\nthe full realization of emptiness, like drinking the entire ocean.\n- Jamgon Mipam: His Life and Teachings\"\n\"There is the self that arises from conceptual reification, seeing through that with anatta insight is entry\npoint.\nThere is the self that arises in marketplace, in day to day activities, anatta of that is graduation.\" - John\nTan, 2018\nMany non-traditionalists may think that a literal interpretation of Buddha’s fetter/emotional model is\nunrealistic, and I understand that it is reasonable according to that perspective to create a modernist\nrevision of the original models. However, regardless of whether their premise is true - and their premise\nis simply an opinion in the eyes of many - I think it will cause too much confusion/discrepancies to create\na separate re-definition/model out of what was originally intended to be heavily based on eliminating the\nthree poisons/ten fetters. As far as my practice go, I can say with certainty from my own experience that\nawakening and the deepening of awakening will lead to a spontaneously virtuous life (one’s actions that\n1343\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\narise out of a pure and luminous mind/universe devoid of any sense of, or clinging to, self/Self are\nautomatically and naturally virtuous, rather than based on a forced or contrived set of virtues via\nfollowing rules) and one does become incapable of intentionally causing harm to others, and one’s\nemotional afflictions does get attenuated and then eliminated (see chapter: Overcoming the Emotional\nAfflictions (aka. Kleshas, Samskaras, Vasanas), however I cannot say that I fully meet all criterias for\nthe traditional fetter model of ‘arahantship’ or ‘buddhahood’ at the point of writing.\nThere are also many people who think that enlightenment confers things like some kind of mastery of\nmagical powers, which is magical thinking. This is scripturally untrue, especially since the early texts of\nBuddhism in the Pali canon such as Susima Sutta states that many arahants did not have any\nsupernatural powers but relied on wisdom for liberation. It is true that the Buddha and many of his\narahant disciples, including but not limited to Mogallana (foremost in psychic powers), claims mastery of\nsiddhis. Furthermore, a number of awake people I personally know, including John Tan and Sim Pern\nChong, have had certain experiences with them (of course, not the sort of mastery like Buddha or\nMogallana) - John Tan prefers to call them “non-local experiences”, although I suspect John Tan would not\nwant me to write about his experiences so I shall avoid discussing in detail here - but in his view, the\nprimary benefit of such experiences is that it provides an avenue for strengthening one’s insight into\nemptiness through having certain experiences of the non-locality of dharma and dependent origination.\nDaniel M. Ingram had done more than one interviews sharing his personal experiences with siddhis - see\nOn \"Supernatural Powers\" or Siddhis, and Past Lives, also John Tan told me this article by Daniel M.\nIngram is what John meant by magic: http://integrateddaniel.info/magick-and-the-brahma-viharas/.\nHowever, it is simply not true that awakening automatically confers psychic abilities. Even in so called\n‘highest teachings’ of Tibetan Buddhism like Mahamudra, it is taught that mastering the four yogas of\nMahamudra confers full realization and liberation which is an equivalent of Buddhahood, yet not\nnecessarily other qualities like the perfection of siddhis that the Buddha had, at least while still living,\nwhile suggesting that these powers may manifest fully only in the afterlife due to taking up a “quick path”,\nin contrast to the “3 aeons minimum” slow path of common Mahayana which involves complete mastery\nof the ten paramitas (one of which is the mastery of spiritual powers) through gradual ardious practice.\nHowever, it is general knowledge that siddhis can be cultivated through the mastery of samadhi and\njhana, and it is not even necessary that one be awakened to attain these powers. Hence the normal and\ncommon siddhis are considered ‘mundane siddhis’ in Buddhist teachings, whereas the true\nsupramundane siddhi is simply liberation itself. Many Buddhist masters would actively discourage the\npursuit of such powers/siddhis (at least before liberation is attained) as it often becomes a distraction\nfrom the more important goal of liberation itself.\nHowever here is a short excerpt that reveals the gist to the attaining of siddhis:\n“The Buddha particularly stresses a set of practices called ‘the four roads to power’ (iddhipada, or ‘bases\nof success’) as the means to winning the superknowledges. They are often described in the texts by a set\nformula that runs as follows:\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and\nvolitional forces of striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy\n1344\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nand volitional forces of striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to\nmind and volitional forces of striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration\ndue to investigation and volitional forces of striving.\nHere four separate mental factors are singled out as the main agents for developing concentration:\ndesire, energy, mind, and investigation (chanda, viriya, citta, vimamsa). To ensure that the jhana attained\nwill not merely engender a state of calm but will also serve as a repository of energy, each has to be\naccompanied by ‘volitional forces of striving’ (pandhanasankhara). These forces build up immense psychic\nenergy which can then be tapped, by a suitable determination, to exercise the supernormal powers.” -\nGreat Disciples of the Buddha by Nyanaponika Thera & Hellmuth Hecker\nPosted in AtR group:\nOn Siddhis: I like what Clarifying the Natural State says about it (very little, but relevant)\n\"Even though you have attained the realization of greater\nOne Taste, if you fail to have some degree of clairvoyance\nand receive signs from the dakinis, you must be tainted by\ndamaged samayas.

The\ntreatise entitled the Chaturdev̄paripc̣\n1347\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nch̄ proclaims:\nWhen one’s physical vehicle of karma disintegrates,\nThen, through one’s spiritual power,\nOne will achieve such a body as one has aspired to.\nThis body will permeate all static and dynamic\nphenomena,\nThe way space encompasses everything.\nUnderstand that it remains so.\nThe Sampụa affirms:\nWhen one’s physical vehicle of karma disintegrates,\nOne will attain a supreme form.\nKeeping in view this matter [of attaining some of the\ngreat qualities long after one has realized the spiritual\npath], Je Shang states:\nMisery may not completely disappear\nImmediately upon realizing the [truth of] nonduality.\nWho can deny that someone has attained the path of\ninsight,\nEven though he has yet to realize the complete\nqualities?\nThe early morning sun can neither melt frozen water\nNor heat the ground and stones at once.\nYet who can deny the existence of the sun?\nSuch sayings are consistent with the fact of human\nexperience. For instance, the new moon may be incomplete\nin its form, yet it is still the moon. A child may not be fully\ngrown, yet it is still a human being. However undeveloped\na lion’s cub, it is still a lion. In this respect Je Gyare\ncomments:\nEven among the Arahats\nThere are two kinds:\nAdorned and unadorned ones.215\nEven among Bodhisattvas\nThere are two kinds:\nRenowned and unrenowned ones.\nEven in the mystic tradition\nThere are two kinds of mystics:\nThe ones practicing secretly and the ones doing it\namidst an assembly.\nWith regard to those who have attained realization\nThere are two kinds:\nThose who can describe [knowledge] and those who\ncan demonstrate [it].\nRegarding those who have attained the grounds and\npaths\nThere are two kinds:\n1348\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nThose who have understood the grounds and paths\nAnd those who have achieved them.\nAs for the great meditators who have knowledge of\nthe grounds and paths\nAnd those who have realized [can demonstrate] them,\nSome have fully achieved great powers of\npsychophysical transformation\nWhile others have failed to attain them and others\nhave achieved mixed abilities.\nSome of them fulfill the needs of sentient beings,\nWhile others fail to fulfill them.\nThis is due to the greater or lesser intensity of their\npractices.\nI shall now sum up these sayings. The great qualities\nassociated with the grounds and the paths, according to the\ntreatises of the vehicle of dialectics, are revealed skillfully\nout of some higher motivation. The paths [of the four\nyogas] are not the same as these. Even the inner signs of\nrealization on these paths are diffferent. Just as there\nexisted adorned and unadorned Arahats and renowned and\nunrenowned Bodhisattvas, there are diffferent types of\ngreat meditators, some possessing the sublime power of\ntransformation and others lacking this power, due mainly to\nthe diffference in the quality of their practices. It has been\nsaid that in order to achieve the sublime power of\ntransformation and other great qualities, one must strive\nhard on the path of the transient world and the higher path\nof mantraȳna.\nWith this I have completed the elucidation of the\nmeditation on the Mah̄ mudr̄ of ultimate certainty, especially\nthe diffferentiation of each of the four yogas and the\nmethods for crossing the grounds and the paths of\nenlightenment.\"\n\"My advice is knowing our nature does not require us to \"rojak\" [Soh: turn quantum physics and\nspirituality into an eclectic mix] them at all and the benefits of practice is something very tangible. It can\nbe realized, known and experienced including the supramadane abilities of buddha and bodhisattvas, the\nsambhogakaya body and buddhafields to those that are serious in practice. They maybe myth to some\nbut not myth to me, at least it can be verified by first person experiences (imo) regardless how science\nthink and that are already enough for me to cope.\" - John Tan,

siddhis/powers)\n1349\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n(11:14 PM) AEN: lol\n(11:16 PM) Thusness: i wish i can discuss with him but he is not the person for me to discuss. :)\n(11:16 PM) AEN: huh why\n(11:16 PM) Thusness: anyway unless i am an irresponsible person, i will not discuss such thing in\npublic forum.\n(11:17 PM) AEN: oic\n(11:17 PM) AEN: why is he not for you to discuss\n(11:17 PM) Thusness: though i would very much like to.\n(11:17 PM) AEN: icic\n(11:18 PM) Thusness: in fact i have been looking for someone that have perfected non-duality to\nwriting something about non locality, i have told you before.\n(11:18 PM) AEN: oic\n(11:18 PM) AEN: so wat are you saying.. you wan to discuss supernatural powers and non locality\nwith someone?\n(11:18 PM) AEN: as in someone non dual\n(11:19 PM) Thusness: someone that has deep experience in non duality. :)\n(11:19 PM) AEN: icic.. so tats why you don wan to discuss with the forum guy? cos he's not non dual\nyet?\n(11:19 PM) Thusness: i do not wish to talk to people in samatha meditation.\n(11:19 PM) AEN: why\n(11:20 PM) Thusness: and only when i know the person is already enlightened. :)\n(11:20 PM) Thusness: otherwise there is no point.\n(11:21 PM) Thusness: and i do not want people to misinterpret the nature of these experiences.\n(11:21 PM) Thusness: i also do not like people to bullshit about these experiences.\n(11:21 PM) Thusness: and also do not like people to make fun of these experiences.\n(11:21 PM) Thusness: lol\n(11:21 PM) AEN: what you mean by bullshit and make fun\n(11:21 PM) Thusness: i might leave something before my i die.\n(11:21 PM) AEN: leave what?\n(11:22 PM) Thusness: my experiences and how to get access to it after non-duality.\n(11:22 PM) AEN: oic wat sort of experiences?\n(11:22 PM) Thusness: u are not enlightened yet. :P\n1350\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n(11:22 PM) AEN: about supernatural powers? lol\n(11:23 PM) Thusness: yeah. :)\n(11:23 PM) Thusness: ur mind is not stable yet.\n(11:23 PM) AEN: oic btw wats the uses of supernatural powers.. how can supernatural power help\none and others\n(11:24 PM) AEN: my mind not stable means?\n(11:25 PM) Thusness: with your current state of mind, you will not be able to correctly absorb in\nwhatever aspect.\n(11:26 PM) Thusness: whatever that is necessary are already stated in sutras\n(11:26 PM) Thusness: there is really no point bringing it out to discuss.\n(11:26 PM) Thusness: what one experiences for me is to break the perceptual bond that prevent us\nfrom knowing some subtle aspects of our mind.\n(11:27 PM) Thusness: that is too difficult to break by merely just accepting things.\n(11:28 PM) Thusness: the way to access to paranormal experiences differs.\n(11:28 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:28 PM) Thusness: however for one that has stabilize non dual path, it is the natural progression\nto experience something non-local\n(11:28 PM) Thusness: some non-local aspect of our nature.\n(11:29 PM) Thusness: to understand our nature.\n(11:29 PM) Thusness: what good is there really to discuss the non local aspect of it besides that?\n(11:29 PM) Thusness: i do not like to call it supernatural power.\n(11:29 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:30 PM) Thusness: u can see that i seldom call it so.\n(11:30 PM) Thusness: i call it non local aspects of our nature.\n(11:30 PM) AEN: icic\n(11:30 PM) Thusness: as it is part of our nature.\n(11:30 PM) Thusness: in line with emptiness.\n(11:30 PM) Thusness: i do not like to deviate from the profound teachings of emptiness.\n(11:30 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:31 PM) Thusness: of our nature. :)\n(11:31 PM) AEN: icic\n(11:31 PM) Thusness: that is why i also do not wish to discuss with anyone that is on concentration.\n1351\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n(11:31 PM) Thusness: coz it is not about wisdom and our nature.\n(11:32 PM) AEN: btw theres difference rite between someone who gain those powers from\nconcentration, and those who become enlightened and those so called powers actually arise from prajna?\n(11:32 PM) Thusness: if you want to know, know what is our nature and practice.\n(11:32 PM) AEN: icic\n(11:32 PM) Thusness: i do not know, i have not discussed with them. :)\n(11:36 PM) Thusness: first is the realisation.\n(11:36 PM) AEN: what you mean\n(11:36 PM) Thusness: u must realise what is meant by non duality.\n(11:36 PM) Thusness: what is no-self\n(11:36 PM) Thusness: realisation.\n(11:37 PM) AEN: icic\n(11:37 PM) Thusness: like longchen\n(11:37 PM) Thusness: experience it.\n(11:37 PM) Thusness: then your dualistic thought will continue to confuse you.\n(11:37 PM) Thusness: it is not easy to overcome\n(11:37 PM) Thusness: until it has sunk so deep into your consciousness\n(11:37 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:38 PM) Thusness: that one day your realisation and action become one...\n(11:38 PM) Thusness: somehow you 'see' the pathless path towards non dual at every moment.\n(11:39 PM) Thusness: but due to attachments, the experience of non duality through wisdom will\nnot be thorough.\n(11:39 PM) Thusness: so you must practice the other 5 paramitas\n(11:39 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:40 PM) Thusness: then non dual in action can become one....to clear other forms of\nattachments and to further experience our boundless nature.\n(11:40 PM) Thusness: but some of these bonds can be cleared if one is able to have non local\nexperiences.\n(11:40 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:41 PM) Thusness: certain attachments will subside due to these experiences.\n1352\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n(11:41 PM) Thusness: but the practice of the other 5 parimatas are more thorough.\n(11:41 PM) Thusness: non local aspects of our nature if without sufficient wisdom will have side\neffects.\n(11:42 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:42 PM) AEN: what side effects\n(11:42 PM) AEN: 5 paramitas how does it help\n(11:42 PM) AEN: in non attachment?\n(11:42 PM) Thusness: to me side effects is always creating perceptual bond on other aspects.\n(11:42 PM) Thusness: u eliminate one and you add 3.\n(11:42 PM) Thusness: :)\n(11:42 PM) AEN: oic...\n(11:43 PM) Thusness: if non local aspects is experienced and you unknowingly add to our ego other\nform of bonds, then it is quite difficult to break.\n(11:44 PM) Thusness: coz it was caused by non local experiences.\n(11:44 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:44 PM) AEN: u mean like being identified/attached to having supernatural powers?\n(11:45 PM) Thusness: one of them.\n(11:45 PM) Thusness: or you may visit other realms and get attached?\n(11:45 PM) Thusness: or you may contact spirits and be attached and dwell with them...\n(11:45 PM) AEN: icic..\n(11:45 PM) Thusness: u do not know... when you dwell...\n(11:46 PM) Thusness: u may sink into deeper illusion into the realm that you have created without\nknowing\n(11:46 PM) AEN: oic..\n(11:46 PM) Thusness: it is not just a matter of ego. :)\n(11:47 PM) AEN: yea teacher chen said\n(11:47 PM) Thusness: it is our wisdom and clarity have not penetrated to the depth of seeing\nthrough these states.\nOn the duration it takes to attain Buddhahood:\n1353\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n[1:21 AM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: Have you listened to the Dan brown? [Soh: this is referring to another\nvideo -- https://www.fitmind.co/.../dan-brown-phd-meditation-great... ]\n[1:21 AM, 10/8/2020] Soh Wei Yu: havent yet.. is it good?\n[1:21 AM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: From I AM to non-dual to one mind to no mind\n[1:22 AM, 10/8/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic.. but not anatta?\n[1:22 AM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: To dzogchen, the view is the practice or view includes practice. You listen\ntomorrow, you will understand. Hale must be thinking that it is quite similar with the phases of insights\nBut I deleted that away in the comment\n[1:25 AM, 10/8/2020] Soh Wei Yu: oic.. why delete\n[1:27 AM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: I dunno about dzogchen much, so I will stay with what I know and\nexperience...lol. Instead of saying phases of insights are similar, will cause unnecessary issues...and I am\nnot trying to come out some version of jaxchen or soh-chen...\n[9:23 AM, 10/8/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic.. you said it talks about no mind but it didnt mention about anatta\nrealization?\n[9:29 AM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: Yeah\n[2:09 PM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: Frankly I like Dan brown video but the timeline is unrealistic.\n[2:11 PM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: The steps are however clear.\nNauli for example. Even doing the centre extrusion will take few months of practice and to really churn\nthe will take about 2 years. To churn and have sufficient control will take much more time. Even if you\npractice diligently as an exercise will take you probably 4-5 years to master.\n[2:13 PM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: As for insights, it is not a matter of pointing out, the stability will take\nprobably 10-25 years post anatta to even have stability and that is practicing quite diligently. Resting in\nappearances without observer and observed will take probably more time. Into 3 states IMO and\nexperiences require another understanding and that is important. The key is in the message I told andre\nand asked you what are the other ways beside anatta and do for active mode of no-agency.\n[2:16 PM, 10/8/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Oic.. but buddha said you can attain arahant between 7 days to 7 years\njust by practicing four foundations of mindfulness.. but i guess that timeline is for monks and often in\nretreat\n[2:17 PM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: That is not Buddhahood\n[2:17 PM, 10/8/2020] Soh Wei Yu: Ic.. but should have cleared the ten fetters right\n[2:17 PM, 10/8/2020] John Tan: Yes. That is why I told you to ponder on the no agency part. You need to\nhave that insight, otherwise it is just half done. In other words it is no self in active mode. Why is it half\ndone? Because it is normally in passive mode. So your dreams will normally remain karmic.\n(Elaborated more in: https://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2021/03/activeinactive-mode-of-no-self-\nduration.html)\n…\nMr. J.J.:\n1354\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nWhat are the last arhats and Buddhas that have walked this planet that fulfill the criteria of AtR (clear 10\nfetters, clear all mental obscurrations)?\nWhat records do we have of them?\nI am interested in cross referencing the ideas put forth in the old texts with something more recent. The\nchances that things have been changed through oral transmission is too high.\nIf there really isn't anything more recent, I'm a bit suspicious whether what's been passed down is really\nattainable or whether things have been changed for propaganda purposes. (religions are fairly political\nand often have their agendas for sacred texts to be read a certain way 😉)\nSoh Wei Yu:\nThe problem with arahats is that monks and nuns have a precept that forbids them from announcing\ntheir claims to laypersons. This means arahants cannot make a public announcement, but he/she can tell\nhis/her monastic colleagues, and you can basically snoop around for information as a layperson, but you\ncan't be so sure.\nThere could be many that never saw the light of day because of that prohibition. I'm sure things would\nhave been very different if Buddha did not create that rule, but nonetheless, he has his reasons. The good\nthing about creating a prohibition is that it could prevent outright chaos and run-off-the-mill monks who\nproclaim arahantship in order to gather disciples, for example. The bad side to the rule is that, well, we'll\nnever know for sure who the real ones are, our best source of information is from asking around.\nStudents of certain masters will tend to say their master is an arahant, because humans have their biases.\nI've heard Ajahn X is an arahant, although, he seems more prone to I AMness to me. Ajahn Z said he's an\narahant, however he's still more into one mind than anatta. Although you hear about people saying this\nand that master is an arahant, I have never met one today that I am really convinced so far. Although I\nknow of monks and nuns who realize anatta. There is also a Theravadin monk who realised anatta\nthrough AtR this year (previously went through I AM). He's quiet about his realisation publicly as you can\nsee, maybe because of precepts. There could very well be monks and nuns today living quietly and have\nattained arhantship. But we may never know.\nRealization of anatta is extremely rare these days, let alone further progression from anatta, although\ncertainly anatta is no finality. This is a point John Tan complained about in\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2018/12/vipassana-must-go-with-luminous.html\nNonetheless, we have the well known ones like Arahant Upatissa (1st century CE – 2nd century CE),\nNagasena (150 BCE), who are well known to be arahants. They are universally agreed throughout\n1355\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nBuddhism to be arahants who lived post-Buddha, and they have left behind very important texts. One of\nNagasena's passage was crucial to John Tan's progression from anatta to emptiness.\nAs for Buddhas...\nAmong the three Buddhist traditions - Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, only Vajrayana emphasizes\nthe possibility of attaining Buddhahood in one life.\nIn both Theravada and Mahayana, scripturally, attaining Buddhahood takes three aeons minimum, as\nopposed to the possibility of attaining arahantship in one life, or maybe the first bhumi if you are a\nMahayana practitioner.\nHowever, we did see that certain Zen masters such as Bodhidharma elude to the possibility of attaining\nBuddhahood in one life, although not very elaborate. Not as elaborate as Vajrayana Buddhism.\nThat being said, my Chinese Buddhist master I took refuge under, who holds Linji Ch'an lineage, in\nfollowing standard Mahayana scriptural understandings, is also of the view that attaining Buddhahood\ntakes 3 aeons, although suggesting that attaining the first bhumi in this life is attainable.\nVajrayana is a species of Mahayana Buddhism, and their definition of Buddhahood is largely congruent.\nRainbow body is equated with Buddhahood in Vajrayana.\nAs Arcaya Malcolm also pointed out, maps of awakening in Buddhism are governed by the elimination of\nthe twin obscurations of affliction and knowledge, and that Dzogchen is the same in this respect.\nAccording to the Vajrayana view, the difference between Vajrayana and Mahayana is not in the view or\nfruition, but in the expedients or methods or path of practice. It is said to be more efficient, according to\ntheir teachings, therefore making the possibility of Buddhahood in one life.\nMany practitioners were understood to have attained rainbow body even up to modern times. Dzogchen\nteacher Acarya Malcolm Smith's Dzogchen teacher Kunzang Dechen Lingpa (who asked Malcolm to teach\nDzogchen) is said to have proclaimed his own full enlightenment. Malcolm is of the view that he has\nremoved all afflictions, basically, clearing those two obscurations... at least he said that in his talks.\nI do not know too much about his teacher, so I cannot tell you any more information or verify any of it.\n1356\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nSoh Wei Yu:\nAlthough it must be stated that Malcolm basically said it is extremely difficult, close to impossible\n(although with rare exceptions) that we can attain rainbow body in this life from being a lay person with a\nday job and so on. Usually it requires years, more than a decade possibly, of retreat practices. Most\nDzogchenpa gets liberated in the bardo instead.\n…\nAsaf Bartov\nSo if I understand correctly, no 😂\nA good question is would a full buddha from vajrayana side, be considered a full arhat according to the\nten fetter model? Not so sure\nSoh Wei Yu:\nMalcolm's view is the same as Mahayana - a full Buddha is someone who removes all afflictive\nobscurations, just like an arahant, and additionally the cognitive obscurations.\nKyle Dixon can confirm.\nBut he did say Mahayana accepts that arhats, bodhisattvas, Buddhas, can manifest as lay persons.\n(Also we have the famous example in Mahayana, Vimalakirti Sutra, of a lay person tenth stage\nbodhisattva)\nI don't have an issue with the idea that someone can manifest as any manner of being out of\ncompassionate purposes.\nThat being said, the key is that the two obscurations are removed.\n...\nThe answer is \"there could be\" - we need to check out the recent rainbow body attainers. I'm not sure if\nany one are presently living.\nGeovani Geo\n1357\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nbadge icon\nHow are you going to check that while he is alive?\nHe may say that he attained. His disciples also may say he did. But that, eventually, may not be the fact,\nnecessarily.\nSoh Wei Yu\nbadge icon\nAccording to Malcolm, there are very specific signs with regards to Dzogchen Togal practice that indicates\nthat the practitioner has reached the finishing point of the fourth vision, the exhaustion of all phenomena\ninto dharmata, the rainbow body/Buddhahood, etc. According to Malcolm, KDL has exhibited these signs\nin his practice, in addition to his own proclamations. He gave specific examples which I cannot recall now\nand may not be appropriate to give details in a public forum anyway.\nBut of course, it is not exactly easy to know who is an arahant or a Buddha, unless you have the psychic\npowers to read the minds of others.\nThere is a teaching by Buddha on how to test if someone is an arahant:\nhttps://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato\nHowever it should be only through long observation that one can determine -\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/Ud/ud6_2.html \"Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual\npleasures; living confined with children; using Kāsī fabrics & sandalwood; wearing garlands, scents, &\ncreams; handling gold & silver, it's hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to\narahantship.\n\"It's through living together that a person's virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a\nshort period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one\nwho is not discerning.\"\nAlso, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.027.than.html\nBhikkhu Pesala:\n\"There is also this story that I have quoted a few times before:\n1358\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\nA certain monk was living in dependence on an Arahant. Living in dependence meant that he shared the\nsame room as his teacher, did all the duties for him, and carried his almsbowl for him while walking\nbehind for alms. One day, while walking for alms, the pupil asked, “Venerable sir, how can one know\nwhether another person is an Arahant?”\nThe Arahant replied, “It is not easy, friend, to know if another person is an Arahant. Even if one lived in\ndependence on an Arahant, did all the duties for him, and carried his almsbowl while walking behind him\nfor alms, one might not know that his teacher was an Arahant.”\nEven when given such a broad hint as this, the pupil did not realise that his teacher was an Arahant. The\nArahants have stainless minds free from all pride and conceit. They do not boast of their attainments,\nunless there is no other way to help people.\"\nAlan Smith\nI'm not sure which stage enables one to sit in perfect composure as you are burned alive in an act of\ncompassion (that was very effective at achieving it's intended end). Can Siddhi masters do this? An Arhant\nthing? Anagami?\nRegardless, Thich Quảng Đức is evidence of what is possible:\nDavid Halberstam wrote:\n\"I was to see that sight again, but once was enough. Flames were coming from a human being; his body\nwas slowly withering and shriveling up, his head blackening and charring. In the air was the smell of\nburning human flesh; human beings burn surprisingly quickly. Behind me I could hear the sobbing of the\nVietnamese who were now gathering. I was too shocked to cry, too confused to take notes or ask\nquestions, too bewildered to even think ... As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a\nsound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him.\"\n3\nSoh Wei Yu\nbadge icon\nAlan Smith\nJohn Tan has a Thai monk master who was not so much into insight (Soh: the Thai master attained I AM\nrealization), but his samadhi and meditation was super powerful. He burned one finger, that is hard\nenough, and he burned his second finger right after that. He had fever etc.\nHe talked about it in the AtR group meeting but I haven't transcribed that part.\n(Soh: There’s a Chinese article on this monk posted by John Tan:\nhttps://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2018/08/wat-tham-khao-rup-chang.html )\n· Reply\n1359\nTraditional Buddhist Attainments: Arahantship and Buddhahood\n· 1m · Edited\nUpdate: Thrangu Rinpoche is the latest practitioner/teacher to attain Buddhahood.

I enjoy reading his teachings\nvery much.\nFrom an email I received:\nThrangu Rinpoche's Passing\nNamo Buddha Publications\nThe Miracle of Thrangu Rinpoche's Passing\nThrangu Rinpoche was in the hospital in June, 2023 and being quite ill, he asked to return to his Namo\nBuddha Monastery. There he went into meditation posture and passed away on June 4th doing the\nRainbow Body (jalung) which is done only by advanced practitioners. His heart and breathing stopped and\nhe remained in this position for four days. His skin was fresh and there were no signs of deterioration.\nThere are two kinds of Rainbow Body: one in which the lama vanishes into thin air leaving behind only\nhair and fingernails, and the other is for the body to shrink. Thrangu Rinpoche's body began to shrink in\nperfect proportion, which included his bones, to less than his half size. These are pictures that I took at\nThrangu Rinpoche's cremation on November 4, 2023.\n1VRL Entrance to Namo Buddha complex Photo 1&2.

This stadium had over a 1,000 chairs. This area specially\nprepared held 2,000 people and was just a short walk from the monastery. You can see trees covering the\nwhole mountain that Vajra Vidya is on.\n6VR. Cremation Ground inside Photo 6 I did my knowledgeable estimation of the number who attended\nand came up with 2,000 people. A staff member who said that is what they also estimated.\n7VR. Crematorum Photo 7and 8. This is the crematorium which had four opening in each direction. There\nwas a procession of high lamas and monks carrying the kundun in and then placing Rinpoche’s body in\nthe crematorium.\n8VR. Placing Body in creamatorum Here we can see one of the lamas helping place the body in the\ncrematorium.\n9VR. Burning of body Photo 9. At 10:30 the fire was lit and sacred grass, oils, and precious substances\nwere added to the burning body. It burned for about an hour. 3 days later the ashes will be recovered to\nsee if there are any relics among them.\n10. Body in Crematorium Photo 10: Through one of the four holes in the crematorium, you can see\nThrangu Rinpoche’s body. My camera is not that good, but it looks to me like he is facing (north) toward\nus and has an elaborate headdress on.\n11VR. Mahkala Rock decorated hoto 11: I almost forgot. There was a large black rock that Thrangu\nRinpoche identified as being Mahakala or representing Mahakala (I am not sure) but they dug it up and\nturned it over and displayed it very prominently at the cremation.\nIt is important that we Buddhist share what we know.

The\nsign of this is that at death the body shrinks to a very small size.\"\n\" Rainbow body is buddhahood. So any standard description of a Buddha's experience of the\ninexhaustible ornamental wheel of the body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities of the Buddha would\napply. \"\n\" \"Rainbow body\" is a name for what happens when the elements of body reverts back to their original\nnature as pristine consciousness as a result of the process of Dzogchen practice or completion stage\npractice. A key point of Vajrayāna is that there is no buddhahood that is not grounded in the body. Hence,\nthe attainment of rainbow body, or the body of light, is regarded as proof that a practitioner has attained\nbuddhahood. This is never mentioned in sūtra because sūtra has no methods of practice that involve the\nbody as a vehicle for awakening.\"\nAs for the type of Buddhahood that is the rainbow body where body shrinks vs disappear entirely:\nSomeone asked, \"I have read of two kinds of rainbow bodies: the one where the body shrinks and the\nsecond where the body disappears entirely.\"\nAcarya Malcolm said, \"The first is partial rainbow body.\"\nTomamundsen: \"Is partial rainbow body the 16th bhumi, buddhahood without remainder?\"\nAcarya Malcolm said, \"No. It is Buddhahood with signs.\"\n1366\nConcluding notes\no\no\n▪ Reply\n▪ 1m\no\n•\nSim Pern Chong\nAmazing\nUpdate:\nThere's another book by Thrangu Rinpoche recommended by John Tan around 2009 -\nEssentials of Mahamudra: Looking Directly at Mind\n- https://namobuddhapub.org/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=98\nLabels: Buddhahood, Mahamudra, Rainbow Body, Thrangu Rinpoche |\nConcluding notes\nOn the Non-Linear and Non-Hierarchical Unfolding of Insights\n“Also, even though I presented my journal as if there is a kind of linear progression going on, in truth we\nshould not see these stages/phases as strictly linear or having a hierarchy. For example, some are able to\nunderstand the profound wisdom of emptiness from the start but have no direct experience of luminosity,\nthen luminosity becomes a later phase. So does that mean the most pristine experience of \"I AM\" is now\nthe last stage? On the other hand, some have experienced luminosity but do not understand how he got\nhimself 'lost', as there is no insight to the karmic tendencies/propensities at all, therefore dependent\norigination cannot be adequately understood. But does that mean that the one that experiences emptiness\nis higher than the one experiencing luminosity?\nSome people experience non-dual but do not go through the I AM, and then after realizing non-duality the\nI AM becomes even more precious because it brings out the luminosity aspect more. Also, when in non-\ndual, one can still be full of thoughts, therefore the focus then is to experience the thoroughness of being\nno-thoughts, fully luminous and present... then it is not about non-dual, not about the no object-subject\n1367\nConcluding notes\nsplit, it is about the degree of luminosity for these non-dualist. But for some monks that is trapped in\nluminosity and rest in samadhi, then the focus should be on refining non-dual insight and experience. For\nnon-dualists, depending on the level of understanding, one can move forward and backward, there is no\nhierarchy.\nSo just see the phases as different aspect of insights of our true nature, not necessarily as linear stages or\na 'superiority' and 'inferiority' comparison. What one should understand is what is lacking in the form of\nrealization. There is no hierarchy to it, only insights, all of which are important. Understanding this means\nthat one will be able to see all stages as flat, no higher.\nAnd as I told my friend: There is no order of precedence how the phases of insight can unfold for people.\nSome experience/realize I AM after non-dual, some before. Just like Joan Tollifson puts it: rather than a\nlinear stage progression, sometimes it is more like a spiral going back and forth, even though that is also\njust a relative perspective of things.\nThe spiralling continues until one sees with utter conviction that all phenomena shares the same taste, that\neverything in its primordial purity is Dharmakaya itself.\nThat being said, although there is no strict order of precedence of insight (i.e. not everyone starts with the\nrealization of I AM), of late, I and John realized that it is important to have a first glimpse of our luminous\nessence (i.e. the I AM realization) directly before proceeding into understanding non-dual, anatta and\ndependent origination. Sometimes understanding something (e.g. emptiness/dependent origination) too\nearly will deny oneself from actual realization as it becomes conceptual. Once the conceptual\nunderstanding is formed, even qualified masters will find it difficult to lead the practitioner to the actual\n‘realization’ as a practitioner mistakes conceptual understanding for realization.\nTherefore, if I were to make an advice to ‘beginners’ reading this, my advice would be to start with the\npractice of self-inquiry (though this is by no means the only method, it is one which is very direct and one\nwhich I am familiar with), realize the certainty of Being (the I AMness), then progress from there to\ninvestigate the non-dual, anatta, and empty nature of Presence. However it also depends on the person’s\ninterests and inclinations and he/she should discern for themselves.\nOne thing that is unique about this book is that it covers such a wide range or spectrum of insights - I AM,\nthe aspects of I AM, Non-Dual, Anatta, Emptiness and Maha/Dependent Origination, etc. John once told me\nthat there are no books currently available that he knows of, that actually covers all his 7 stages of\nenlightenment. My journal perhaps is unique in covering many of those insights he mentioned, all in one\nsingle book. However, how relevant each section is to a person would highly depend. If you are reading this,\nI recommend getting some basic understanding of what is I AM, non-dual, anatta and emptiness, but if for\nexample, you still do not realize what is I AM, I would suggest that you focus more on the I AM and self-\n1368\nConcluding notes\ninquiry section first, in terms of practice.\nLastly, I see enlightenment as nothing mystical. It is simply the lifting of veils by practice and insight to reveal\nsubtler aspects of reality. Once we lift conceptual thoughts, we discover I AM. Once we lift the bond of\nduality, we experience and discover non-dual awareness. Once we lift the bond of inherency, we experience\nand discover the absence of agent and a wonderfully luminous yet empty universe occurring via dependent\norigination.” - excerpt from Soh’s E-Book\n“...not to limit experiences by framing it into the phases strictly. Limiting it this way is also limiting how you\nsee and experience your life. That is precisely the essence of consciousness, empty and luminous. Only\ndifference is whether it is realized or simply conceptual. I read new age and YouTube, some are very good\nand enlightening. I look into yoga and energy practice to understand and open my understanding. There\nare always things to be learnt.” - John Tan, 2019\n“(9:52 AM) Thusness: I think so far over the period you know me, i have not said this person is\nsotapanna or arahat… or whatever stage. even for the phases of insights I wrote, I have you told you\numpteen times that it is about insights....not about stages... the appearance of the progression of insights\nfrom \"I AM\" to \"Self-liberation\" is merely due to my conditions.\n(9:52 AM) Thusness: an example would be pegembara article relates more to phase 6 insight and that is\nhow it unfold for him. He may have other realizations in the 7-phases of insights later in his journey. But I\ntruly have no idea how it became a model to validate other's phases of enlightenment in such a short\nspan of time...lol. Frankly i am really not interested what stage I am in now.... however i am fully indebted\nto Buddha's teaching of anatta and dependent origination and what is important now is to fully embrace\nthis view into my moment to moment of experience and sink these realizations of anatta and emptiness\ninto the deepest depth of my consciousness. You have tasted the benefits at such a young age, do not\nwaste your valuable 'conditions'. Treasure it. :) I do not think practitioners at stream entry can realize the\nbreadth and depth of DO. I think ananda is already above stream entry right but to Buddha, he has not\nunderstood DO correctly. think there is a conversation something like that, that he thinks Dependent\nOrigination is easy to understand (Soh: This scripture: https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN15.html\nThe Great Causes Discourse Mahā Nidāna Sutta (DN 15))” - John Tan, 2011\n2007:\n(3:48 PM) Thusness: \"Amala Vijnana you need to study the Vajrasamadhi-sutra - this is the ultimate sutra\nteaching, even more so than the Samdhinirmocana Sutra!\"\nthere is no ultimate teaching. :) it is a person's \"hui geng\". a simple line, a simple text, theravadin\nteachings all can lead one to the ultimate realisation. a simple world 'no-self' and 4 lines can lead one the\ngreat perfection too. :)\n1369\nOther Writings by John Tan\n(3:51 PM) AEN: oic.. hmm ya the first 5 arhats became enlightened by learning 4 noble truths only\nlol\n(3:52 PM) Thusness: :) all sutras depend on \"yuan\" and one's \"geng xin\". it we say it is high, we are\ndeluded. if we say it is low, we are also deluded. middle path is a path without any form of intrinsic-ness.\nwhere can we find a highness? where does it reside? upon conditions it arises. 8 months ago if i talked\nabout emptiness, to JonLS it may sound stupid and of lower grade compare to non-dual experience. 8\nmonths later he think otherwise\n(3:54 PM) AEN: oic..\n(3:55 PM) Thusness: is heart sutra (a sutra about emptiness) greatest for him? what if a person start with\nheart sutra? i will tell him about \"I AMness\". not even non-duality. for longchen i will tell him second door\nand not heart sutra first\n(3:55 PM) AEN: oic.. why will you tell someone who start with heart sutra about i amness\n(3:56 PM) Thusness: for you i tell all to let you have right knowledge. in the past i only tok about no-self\nand not relating it to non-dual. now we tok about non-dual and compare with vedanta and advaita. but it\ndoesn't mean which is higher truth. just conditions and right medicine. :)\n(3:57 PM) AEN: oic.. btw why will you tell someone who start with heart sutra about i amness\n(3:58 PM) Thusness: luminosity. emptiness nature might be understood, not the luminosity aspect\n(3:59 PM) AEN: icic.. emptiness nature understood without luminosity is only conceptually isnt it?\nneed amness first then can experience stage 6?\n(3:59 PM) Thusness: nope. need mindfulness. but amness is a short cut if one has experienced emptiness\nnature. it will not present itself as wrong understanding\nOther Writings by John Tan\nIf you like to read more of John Tan’s writings, check out:\nOn Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection\nRealization and Experience and Non-Dual Experience from Different Perspectives\nEarly Forum Posts by John\nPart 2 of Early Forum Posts by John\nPart 3 of Early Forum Posts by John\nEarly Conversations Part 4\n1370\nA Practice Summary\nEarly Conversations Part 5\nEarly Conversations Part 6\nJohn's Conversations Between 2004 to 2012\nA casual comment about Dependent Origination\nLeaving traces or Attainment?\nEmptiness as Viewless View and Embracing the Transience\nBringing Non-Dual to Foreground (John wrote this to me after I was having nondual experiences after I AM\nbut before anatta realization)\nPutting aside Presence, Penetrate Deeply into Two Fold Emptiness (John wrote this to me after I was having\na deeper insight into anatta after an initial realization of anatta)\nReply to Yacine\nDirect Seal of Great Bliss\nThe Unbounded Field of Awareness\nComments section of The Buddha on Non-Duality\nWhy the Special Interest in Mirror?\nWhat is an Authentic Buddhist Teaching?\nThe Path of Anatta\nThe Key Towards Pure Knowingness\nThe place where there is no earth, fire, wind, space, water\nAtR Blog Posts Tagged Under 'John Tan'“ - Soh, 2019\nA Practice Summary\nThusness (John Tan) wrote to Kim123 in 2009 who he thought would more appropriately benefit from\nVipassana instructions (in contrast to starting with self-enquiry as outlined in this guide):\n“As a start it is almost not possible not to feel dualistic. An observer observing the observed is our ordinary\nexperience and it will appear that this is an experiential fact. Therefore we should not rush into anything but\njust simply recognize the ‘cause’. The cause that made us see in such a way is termed ‘ignorance’. Try to\nunderstand ‘ignorance’ not as not knowing but a form of knowing instead. See it as a very deep form of\n‘dualistic knowing’ that we have taken it to be truth. We then proceed to overcome this wrong view in 2 steps;\none by strongly and firmly establishing the right view to replace our existing ‘dualistic and inherent view’ and\nsecond, practice seeing in bare attention to lessen the grip of views. Practice being bare in bodily sensation till\nthere is a very strong clear mirror feeling in bodily sensation. Then with the right view, non-dual will dawn.\nWithout the right view, it will most likely turn into a mirror reflecting phenomena experience.\nPractices can take decades and often quite frustrating and challenging during the journey. But have faith, be\npatient and have confidence, all effort will prove worthwhile eventually.\nA simple summary I use to help my practice:-\n1371\nA Practice Summary\nWhen there is simply a pure sense of existence;\nWhen awareness appears mirror like;\nWhen sensations become pristine clear and bright;\nThis is Luminosity.\nWhen all arising appear disconnected;\nWhen appearance springs without a center;\nWhen phenomena appears to be on their own without controller;\nThis is No Doer-ship.\nWhen subject/object division is seen as illusion;\nWhen there is clarity that no one is behind thoughts;\nWhen there is only scenery, sounds, thoughts and so forth;\nThis is Anatta.\nWhen phenomena appears pristinely crystal;\nWhen there is merely one seamless experience;\nWhen all is seen as presence;\nThis is Non-dual Presence.\nWhen we feel fully the unfindability and unlocatability of phenomena;\nWhen all experiences are seen as ungraspable;\nWhen all mind boundaries of in/out, there/here, now/then dissolve;\nThis is Emptiness.\nWhen interconnectedness of everything is wholly felt;\nWhen arising appears great, effortless and wonderful;\nWhen presence feels universe;\nThis is Maha.\nWhen arising is not caged in who, where and when;\n1372\nA Practice Summary\nWhen all phenomena appear spontaneous and effortless;\nWhen everything appears right every where, every when;\nThis is Spontaneous Perfection.\nSeeing these as the ground of all experiences;\nAlways and already so;\nThis is Wisdom.\nExperiencing the ground in whatever arises;\nThis is Practice.\nHappy journey.\"\n…\nJohn Tan also wrote in 2013,\n“Intelligent Knowingness as permanent… continuous… so many projections into time… so involved in mind\nconceptualities… Deconstruct seer, what happens is just this spontaneously manifested scenery\nDeconstruct body further, you have mind-body drop\nDeconstruct time, there will only be this clear vivid presence of immediacy\nAfter arising insight of anatta, there is only “directness” and simplicity... go beyond conventions and\nconceptuality and recognize this immediate radiance is exactly what is appearing in this instantaneous\nmoment...\nIf you are in need of a view for practice, then embrace the general principle of Dependent Origination that\ndoesn’t entertain who-when-where construct, it will help sever dualistic and inherent propensities. Otherwise\nyou will have to go back to the koan I asked you when I first met you in IRC… this moment ceases as it arises, is\nthis moment arising or ceasing? If you are clear, then further penetrate this total exertion of immediacy and\nrealize that though there is vivid appearances, there is nothing here… nothing now… you will never find it!”\n1373\nA Practice Summary\nThere are a lot of subtleties to spirituality, so John Tan often warns about those who advocate its simplicity, like\nwhat he wrote in early 2010:\nhttps://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/391975/\n“....What David Carse said requires more than the “I AMness” realization you narrated in your post “Certainty\nof Being”. It also requires more than just glimpses of the non-dual state that can be induced by penetrating\nthe question:\n\"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\"\nIt requires a practitioner to be sufficiently clear about the cause of ‘separation’ so that the perceptual knot that\ncreates the ‘division’ is thoroughly seen through. At this phase, non-dual becomes quite effortless. The three\nfollowing articles that you posted in your blog are all about the thorough insights of seeing through the\nillusionary division created by mental constructs. They are all very well written. It is worth revisiting these\narticles.\n1. Body/No-Body\n2. The Teachings of Atmananda and the Direct Path\n3. The Direct Path\nOf all the 3 articles, I like Joan’s article Body/No-body best. Do not simply go through the motion of reading,\nread with a reverent heart. Though a simple article but is not any less insightful than those written by well-\nknown masters, it has all the answers and pointers you need. 🙂\nNext, there are several points you made that is related to the deconstruction of mental objects but you should\nalso note that there exist a predictable relationship between the 'mental object to be de-constructed' and 'the\nexperiences and realizations'. For example “The Teachings of Atmananda and the Direct Path” will, more often\nthan not lead a practitioner to the realization of One Mind whereas the article from Joan will lead one to the\nexperiential insight of No-Mind. As a general guideline,\n1. If you de-construct the subjective pole, you will be led to the experience of No-Mind.\n2. If you de-construct the objective pole, you will be led to the experience of One-Mind.\n3. If you go through a process of de-constructing prepositional phrases like \"in/out\" \"inside/outside\"\n\"into/onto,\" \"within/without\" \"here/there\", you will dissolve the illusionary nature of locality and time.\n4. If you simply go through the process of self-enquiry by disassociation and elimination without clearly\nunderstanding the non-inherent and dependent originated nature of phenomena, you will be led to the\nexperience of “I AMness”.\nLastly, not to talk too much about self-liberation or the natural state, it can sound extremely misleading.\nAlthough Joan Tollifson spoke of the natural non-dual state is something “so simple, so immediate, so obvious,\nso ever-present that we often overlook”, we have to understand that to even come to this realization of the\n1374\nConclusion\n“Simplicity of What Is”, a practitioner will need to undergo a painstaking process of de-constructing the mental\nconstructs. We must be deeply aware of the ‘blinding spell’ in order to understand consciousness. I believe\nJoan must have gone through a period of deep confusions, not to under-estimate it. 🙂”\nJohn Tan often warned against thinking that Buddhadharma is so simple because actually it is very profound\nand hard to fathom, just as the Buddha has said so himself many times. And John Tan also asked before - of all\nthe sutras, which one of them is so simple and easy to understand? None of them is, so one should not\noversimplify the dharma by making statements like “dharma is so simple, it just so and so” because people will\nmiss out the subtleties. I am not exaggerating when I say that about 98% of “awakened” people, advanced\npractitioners, even teachers are stuck at I AM and one mind, so it will be naive for beginners to try to pin down\nthe dharma in oversimplistic statements and think they got the whole picture. At the same time it is truly\npossible that with the right pointers and effort to come to direct realization of the dharma, as many people\nhave even today.\nBut when I say 98% of awakened people have not realised anatta and/or emptiness, it does not mean it is\nincredibly difficult to do so. With the right pointers, it is not so difficult, so do not fear. As of writing about 40\npeople have at least realised anatta after encountering the Awakening to Reality blog. What the data shows is\nthat an open mindedness to contemplate is necessary, and with the right pointers it is truly possible, even\nhighly probable, to realise. However, many people are stuck in a system where all the teachers and teachings\nreinforce that substantialist view and therefore they do not even want challenge their view or investigate\nfurther, which is why they do not go beyond I Am or One Mind, even though they may be diligent practitioners.\nIf you tell them about anatta, they might just shrug it off.\nConclusion\nThe map is not the territory, and not everyone goes through the exact same path, practices, or the same\nlinear unfolding of phases. Still, I am confident that most people seeking truth and freedom will find\nsomething useful in there. It is the key to the realization and actualization of the nature of mind/reality\nand effortless spontaneous presence. This guidebook is meant to be a practical manual, not a piece of\nphilosophy. It is experiential. To see results, you have to put in quality time into practicing this, meditating\nand contemplating. May you attain awakening and liberation for the benefit of all beings. May this guide\nbe of benefit to all readers.\n\"All 7 phases of insight can be realized and experienced, they are not verbiage. But perfection in terms of\nactualization in everyday life requires refining our view, meeting situations and dedication of quality time\nin anatta and total exertion. The problem is that many do not have the discipline and perseverance.\" -\nJohn Tan, 2014\n1375\nGlossary\nThis guide is based on the materials of the Awakening to Reality Blog (a blog co-\nauthored by John Tan and Soh Wei Yu) and the Awakening to Reality Discussion\nGroup (note: this group is now closed, however you can join to access the old\ndiscussions.

Sentient beings conceive of a\nself to exist within this body-mind, but the Buddha taught that when examined, we find no such thing as a\nsingular entity that we can pin down or establish as a self. Instead, all we find/experience is a composite, a\nheap of flesh, blood and bones, with no self within or apart from the five aggregates or composite which\nare all transient, ungraspable, unsatisfactory and empty of a self. No \"self\" could be pinned down inside or\napart from the aggregates in the same way that no \"chariot-ness\" can be pinned down inside or apart from\nthe parts of it - the wheel, etc. It is simply aggregates being conventionally imputed as such. There is no\nabiding or intrinsic reality/existence. These aggregates co-dependently arise and are empty of any self,\nanything pertaining to an I, a me, or a mine.\nAnatta: non self, empty of self\nAwareness/Mind/Consciousness: Similar to luminosity, this gets refined on ones journey. Initially we think\nwe are beings who have awareness and look out into a world, later it is seen that awareness is none other\nthan what is appearing in experience, all sights, sounds, feelings, thoughts etc.\nBahiya Sutta: a famous discourse by Buddha on non-self that led Bahiya to liberation upon listening.

This principle was originally discovered and taught by the Buddha:“When there is\nthis, that is. With the arising of this, that arises. When this is not, neither is that. With the cessation of this,\nthat ceases.”\nDharma: in the context of teachings, like “Buddhadharma”, it is the teachings of Buddha, or the teachings\nof truth. In the context of appearing phenomena, such as “all dharmas are not-self”, they refer to a unit of\nexperience, activities, arising phenomena or manifestations.\nDharma seal: the nature of phenomena/experiential reality, always already so.\nDhatus: Eighteen dhatus (elements), another teaching of the Buddha. “There are, Ānanda, these eighteen\nelements: the elements of the eye, sights, and eye consciousness; the ear, sounds, and ear consciousness;\nthe nose, smells, and nose consciousness; the tongue, tastes, and tongue consciousness; the body, touches,\nand body consciousness; the mind, thoughts, and mind consciousness. When a mendicant knows and sees\nthese eighteen elements, they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.” - MN115\nEmptiness: the absence of a real existence of a self or an entity that can be pinned down or established\nLuminosity: cognizance, clarity, presence, knowingness, aliveness, intelligence, consciousness, sense of\nexistence, sense of reality, the knowing quality present in experience. This gets refined as we mature in\ninsight. Note that the term ‘luminosity’ may vary according to the source, some Tibetan teachers use it to\nrefer to the aspect of presence-awareness, some may refer to the unity or clarity and emptiness, some\nscriptures may be referring to just the aspect of emptiness. It can be a confusing term but generally this\nguide-book uses it to refer to the aspect of clarity/presence-awareness.\nNDNCDIMOP: Non-dual, non-conceptual, direct and immediate mode of perception. (Also similar to PCE)\nPCE: Pure consciousness experience. This term’s usage was popularized by the Actual Freedom foundation.\nExcerpt from their site: “A pure consciousness experience is a temporary, ‘self’-less and sensuous\nexperience of the perfection and purity of the actual universe. A PCE offers a glimpse or window out from\nthe ‘real’ world everyone is born into (and therefore assumes to be all there is), and one suddenly finds\noneself in the unimaginable, magical, fairytale-like actual world.\nFor a brief period, there is no ‘self’ as a mediator, interpreter, censor or spoiler. All is directly evidenced by\nthe physical senses to be pure, perfect, delightful. One’s intelligence is freed of any emotions and affective\nfeelings – thinking becomes benign, clear and concise – free of malice and sorrow. The already-existing\ninnate purity and perfection that becomes stunningly apparent in this ‘self’-less state instantly renders\nredundant the need for any morals, ethics or any kind of ‘self’-control. With awareness and intelligence\n1377\nGlossary\noperating totally freed from the Human Condition, ‘I’ can then be clearly seen for what ‘I’ am – a parasitical\nidentity who is the source of ‘my’ own suffering and ‘my’ own malice.”\nAlso see: Various Descriptions of Pure Consciousness Experiences\nPresence/Beingness - Doubtless certainty of existence/life. Discovered with I Am realization - see Stage 1\nchapter.\nThe Place Where There is No Heat or Cold: A monk asked Tozan, “When cold and heat come, how can we\navoid them?”\nTozan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nThe monk said, “What is the place where there is no cold or heat?”\nTozan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you; when it’s hot, the heat kills you.”\nThis is not advice to “accept” your situation, as some commentators have suggested, but a direct expression\nof authentic practice and enlightenment. Master Tozan is not saying, “When cold, shiver; when hot, sweat,”\nnor is he saying, “When cold, put on a sweater; when hot, use a fan.” In the state of authentic practice and\nenlightenment, the cold kills you, and there is only cold in the whole universe. The heat kills you, and there\nis only heat in the whole universe. The fragrance of incense kills you, and there is only the fragrance of\nincense in the whole universe. The sound of the bell kills you, and there is only “boooong” in the whole\nuniverse...\n~The Flatbed Sutra of Louie Wing, Ted Biringer\nTwo Cessations: An excerpt from https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Cessation\n“Cessation is of two kinds:\nanalytical (Skt. pratisaṃkhyā-nirodha; Tib. སོ་སོར་བརྟགས་པའི་འགོག་པ་, sosor takpé gokpa, Wyl. so sor brtags pa'i 'gog\npa) and\nnon-analytical (Skt. apratisaṃkhyā-nirodha; Tib. བརྟགས་མིན་འགོག་པ་, tak min gokpa, Wyl. brtags min 'gog pa).\nIn his commentary to Mipham Rinpoche’s Khenjuk, Khenpo Nüden writes:\nAnalytical cessation\nThis is the unconditioned aspect of the permanent elimination of destructive emotions and other factors\nto be eliminated, through the force of developing realization of the undefiling path, such as the wisdom of\ndiscernment, within the mind.\nNon-analytical cessation\nThis does not refer to the ceasing of latent habitual tendencies as a result of analysis and investigation,\nbut rather to the absence of a given thing in a particular place due to an incompleteness of necessary\ncauses and conditions, as in the case of horns on a horse’s head, for instance. Another example which is\n1378\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nmentioned in the commentaries is the fact that other types of consciousness do not arise when the eye-\nconsciousness is distracted by a visual form. This also includes all the various forms of non-existence (or\nabsence), such as the absence of a vase in a particular place.”\nTwo-Fold Emptiness: “Two emptinesses (二空) include (1) emptiness of self, the ātman, the soul, in a person\ncomposed of the five aggregates, constantly changing with causes and conditions; and (2) emptiness of\nselves in all dharmas—each of the five aggregates, each of the twelve fields, and each of the eighteen\nspheres, as well as everything else with no independent existence. No-self in any dharma implies no-self in\na person, but the latter is separated out in the first category. Realization of the emptiness of self in a person\nwill lead to attainment of Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood. Bodhisattvas who have realized both\nemptinesses ascend to the First Ground on their Way to Buddhahood.” - from an online Buddhist glossary\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\n‘If you want to 明心 (comprehend Mind) reading some zen and awareness teachings will help [Soh: also,\nadvaitic and self-enquiry materials will help]. If you want to 见性 (see [empty] nature) you need to explore\ndeeply into emptiness and MMK (Mulamadhyamikakarika of Nagarjuna). If you want to have a feel of 自然\n之道 (the Way of self-so/naturalness/spontaneity), read about 老子 (Lao Tzu) 道德经 (Tao Te Ching), 列子\n(Lieh Tzu) 冲虚经 (Chong Xu Sutra) and 庄子南华经 (Chuang Tzu’s Nan Hua sutra)。Go read about them, it\nwill help you a lot.’ - John Tan, 2019\n‘All these teachings are not pointing to the same things at all. All of them have a different purpose and\nintent but can be integrated. Therefore do not think that Brahman = Emptiness = Tao. You should read\nthe teachings on their own terms, that is how you can properly understand the import of each teaching.\nBrahman is not talking about Emptiness, Emptiness is not talking about Tao. I don’t agree with\nperennialist notions that all teachings point to the same ultimate.’ - Soh, 2019\nLately I have successfully guided a few people. As of now, more than 30 people have realised anatta\nthrough encountering this blog, myself or Thusness, a feat rarely achieved by dharma teachers. (Buddha\nhad thousands of enlightened students but that's another story) This is only possible due to the use of\nmodern technologies that allows easy access worldwide and the unique clarity of Thusness's writings (I'm\nsure Thusness will be quite displeased with me for stating my opinion openly, haha).\nHowever in the future I do not foresee that I will have time to do personal coaching. It is also not fruitful\nto neglect one's practice, as a deva addresses the following verse to Ven. Ānanda as Ven. Ānanda had\nbeen spending too much time teaching Dhamma to laypeople, \"Coming to the bower at the root of a tree,\nplacing unbinding in your heart, do jhāna, Gotama, don’t be heedless. What use is this chitter-chatter to you?\".\n1379\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nThis is why recently I have compiled a list of articles so that the essentials are covered and sufficient for\none's personal contemplation, and do not require any personal coaching.\nIt is advisable to find and learn from a highly awakened spiritual teacher. Read Finding An\nAwakened Spiritual Teacher and Mentor\nI have also updated Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment with further clarifications\ntowards the end of the article as I found that many people who read that article continue to\nmisunderstand those stages.\nPlenty of words and discussions are pointless, sometimes (in fact, often times) just one stanza is enough\nto trigger one's awakening if taken seriously in one's practice. Bahiya attained liberation upon hearing a\nsingle verse of Dhamma from the Buddha. As Buddha said in the Dhammapada, A man is not versed in\nDhamma because he speaks much. He who, after hearing a little Dhamma, realizes its truth directly and is not\nheedless of it, is truly versed in the Dhamma. However, as Thusness pointed out before, unless one has\ndirectly realized the truth of anatta, and one's view and practice is completely refined, pointers from good\nteacher(s) and/or clear dharma books are still necessary.\nOnly after direct realization of anatta (Thusness Stage 5) does it become \"safe\" to explore on one's own,\n\"because after anatta, one is able to see what is meant by direct, gapless and pure, and he is on his own\nto mature this experience, until the next phase comes\" (See: The Path of Anatta by Thusness), and \"all\npractitioners must experience for themselves and not read\". (One can still read, but it takes secondary\nrole in one's practice) On another occasion, Thusness said, \"Only after seeing the 6 phases of insights, you\ncan then be said to be safe to explore on your own. The actual experience cannot be communicated.\"\nAnd as Thusness commented about Simpo (Sim Pern Chong) after he had certain breakthrough\nrealizations, back in 2007, \"given enough time, whatever he said will be like Buddha. But he need not read\nwhat that is taught by Buddha. However by reading it, it may help him and speed up his progress.\",\n\"...longchen (Sim Pern Chong) has realised the importance of transients and the five aggregates as\nBuddha nature, time for unborn nature. You see, it takes one to go through such phases, from \"I AM\" to\nNon-dual to isness then to the very very basic of what Buddha taught... can you see that? The more one\nexperience, the more truth one sees in what Buddha taught in the most basic teaching. Whatever\nlongchen experience is not because he read what Buddha taught, but because he really experience it.\"\nWe are blind at the start, pointers from good teachers and books bring us to the right track, and once\nwe're in the right track, we will have to boldly walk forward ourselves. Unfortunately very clear teachers\nand clear books are hard to come by, so I try to provide a list of good resource that can be of help. I\nseldom read dharma books nowadays, though I have read plenty years ago. Even back in my army days\n(compulsory national service, about 8-9 years ago) I read thousands of pages of Buddhist scriptures,\nthousands of pages of dharma books, thousands of pages of non-Buddhist texts. It has been of help\nalong my journey. But nowadays, I am more interested in actualizing my insights in living experience.\n1380\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nMany have awakened to anatta through reading this blog and contemplating accordingly, without\npersonal coaching. And what I can advise is already documented in my blog articles, Awakening to Reality:\nA Guide to the Nature of Mind and my e-book, and I think I have covered all the essentials quite\nthoroughly. If you have realized anatta through this blog, do write to me, I might even post your story up.\nAlways good to hear an inspiring story.\nAfter reading those articles and Awakening to Reality: A Guide to the Nature of Mind and my e-book, if\nyou still have doubts that need to be clarified, you're welcomed to contact me. However if you have not\nread through those articles and/or Awakening to Reality: A Guide to the Nature of Mind and my e-book,\nplease do so first, as otherwise I will simply be directing you to the existing articles that addresses your\nquestions. Perhaps try doing a search on this blog to find your answer.\nSomeone asked me for book recommendations. What books you should read depends on where you're\nat, what practices you're doing, what realization you're aiming for.\nIf people ask me for advice on where to start, I usually recommend self-inquiry with the aim of attaining\nSelf-Realization (the doubtless realization of I AMness). If you're still trying to attain I AM realization, focus\non the books listed under the Self Inquiry sections. If you feel like you're having glimpses and experiences\nof the I AMness/Witness, do note that there are differing degrees and having glimpses and experiences\nare not the same as having the direct realization and complete certainty of I AM/Self. See I AM\nExperience/Glimpse/Recognition vs I AM Realization (Certainty of Being) and the first point in Realization\nand Experience and Non-Dual Experience from Different Perspectives by Thusness - anything short of the\nunshakeable and doubtless certainty of Being is not the I AM realization but more like a glimpse or\nexperience. Self-inquiry will lead to the realization. I had glimpses of I AM experience for 3 years prior to\nthe doubtless and unshakeable Self-Realization in February 2010 after less than 2 years of self-enquiry,\nwhich I detailed in my e-book, after which the Self/Presence/Awareness was no longer 'maintenance\nstate' or passing glimpses for me and the certainty of what I am was never lost, I no longer felt the 'lose\nit/gain it' syndrome.\nIf you have realized I AM, focus on the four aspects of I AMness and other advices in Awakening to Reality:\nA Guide to the Nature of Mind and my e-book and the two types of nondual contemplation.\nIf you're already past I AM and/or nondual but aiming for anatta realization, just focus on Bahiya Sutta\ncontemplation and its related articles, read The Sun My Heart by Thich Nhat Hanh especially the chapter\non 'There is Knowing in the Wind' and 'Each Action is its Own Subject', you need a more direct\napprehension mode of contemplation, like the way Daniel M. Ingram describes Vipassana here or how\npractice and contemplation is described in Gesture of Awareness).\nIf you think you already realized anatta, more often than not, you haven't. Most people who say they\nrealized anatta are only having a more minor realization of non-doership or having experience of no\nmind, or are unable to distinguish between Thusness Stage 4 and 5. It is also common to fall into the\ndisease of non-conceptuality, mistaking that as the source of liberation and thus clinging to or seeking a\n1381\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nstate of non-conceptuality as the main object of practice, whereas liberation comes only through the\ndissolving of ignorance and views (of inherent existence) that cause reification, by insight and realization.\nSee: The Disease of Non-Conceptuality\nHence, do go through all the links in the comments section of Thusness Seven Stages of Awakening and\nread the article carefully before making a diagnosis on where you are as it is very common to think that\none is there when one is not.\nIf you truly realized anatta and are wondering how to progress, read Advice for Taiyaki and +A and -A\nEmptiness (On the two experiential insights involved in Thusness Stage 6)\nAlso, it is very important to understand that having a conceptual understanding of no-self, dependent\norigination and emptiness is very different from direct realization. As I told Mason Spransy in The\nImportance of Luminosity, it is very possible to have the conceptual understanding of Thusness Stage 6\nbut lacking in direct realization, as that was his issue at that time. Days after that conversation he had\ndirect realization of anatta and total exertion (see: Suchness / Mason Spransy). As Thusness pointed out\nin Purpose of Madhyamaka, if after all the analysis and contemplations of Madhyamaka (Buddhist\nemptiness teachings taught by Nagarjuna) one is unable to realize that the mundane is precisely where\none's natural radiance is fully expressed, a separate pointing is necessary.\nIf you have attained all Thusness 7 Stages, do note that it is not a finality but the beginning of endless\nactualization. Have you perfected all elements of the Noble Eightfold Path? If your insight is clear, how\nabout samadhi (\"right concentration\")? Furthermore, wisdom is just one aspect of practice. Another\nequally important aspect of practice is compassion or metta, which you can read more on your own from\nother sites, beginning with Metta Sutta. This blog hasn't dealt as much in topics like samadhi and\nmetta/karuna, compared to topics on insight and wisdom. This is not because meditation, samadhi and\nmetta/karuna are less important subjects, but there are resources out there that deals with these\nsubjects quite thoroughly. Having a daily and disciplined meditation practice is important (refer to books\nunder Mindfulness Practice/Meditation below). On the other hand, the insights and wisdom presented\nhere by Thusness are very rare, and the clarity on the distinction of View, Realization and Experience can\nhardly be found elsewhere, therefore I have placed more effort to present these insights/wisdom aspect\nof the practice. As Thusness pointed out to me, there has to be a balance between insight, samadhi and\ncompassion, in the sense that all these aspects are important in one's practice. Thusness is also deep into\nYoga and energy practices and sees that as important for further progression in one's practice after\ninsights, however it is beyond the scope of this blog at the moment, as I myself am not at the level of\nexpertise like Thusness. It is important to have an \"integral\" approach to practice rather than skewing\ntowards insight.\nRegardless of where you're at, I still recommend reading the 'General Buddhadharma' books to get a\nrough understanding of Buddhadharma, even if one hasn't realized it yet.\nLastly, if you can find a spiritual community and living teacher, it can be of immense benefit for you.\nThusness adviced before to \"find a good teacher that has gone through the various phases of insights, at\n1382\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nleast until phase 5 of insight. However [in phase 5] one might still miss certain point [disregarding\nDependent Origination]\". Realistically speaking, it is quite hard to find someone who has at least realized\nThusness Stage 5. That realization is very rare. For example, I searched around in my country and did not\nfind any, though I can find lineage teachers at the I AM and Non Dual phases of insight (Stage 1 to 4).\nHowever, it should be known that whether the teacher has the exact same understanding of dharma, or\nwhether he/she is coming from a very deep level of realization, there are always things that can be learnt,\nand a community of practitioners can be of a great help and encouragement to one's practice. Therefore I\nhope you will not have too much of an expectation for a dharma/meditation teacher, such as an\nexpectation for a teacher to be fully realized. If there is someone who can help you grow spirituality, then\nseek their guidance. But you yourself must have clear understanding of dharma, have right views, and not\nbe misguided. So read through this blog and the book recommendations. Group practice of sitting\nmeditation can often be beneficial, it is something you have to experience for yourself. Refer to the book\nMeditation Now or Never by Steve Hagen for advice on how to find a good and qualified meditation teacher\nand practical advices on meditation. You need to overcome the common issues of 1) motivation, 2)\nmonkey mind, 3) drowsiness. Mindful awareness is key, it solves dullness or drowsiness. Tranquility and\nrelease is key, it solves monkey mind. Consistency and discipline is key, getting habituated to a consistent\npractice solves the issue of motivation, especially when one tastes the higher state of bliss and clarity\nfrom meditation. I currently practice Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) and Satipatthana (Four\nFoundations of Mindfulness) while actualizing my insights like how Suzuki Roshi describes. This\nactualization is not confined to sitting but continues in everyday life (also see: What is Total Exertion?). See\nalso: How silent meditation helped me with nondual inquiry\nHappy New Year and may you attain Nirvana and realize all appearances are fundamentally in Nirvanic\nquiescence - the unity of two truths.\n\"The affairs of the world will go on forever. Do not delay the practice of meditation.\"\n- Milarepa\n“Do not waste time but practise zazen (Just Sitting) as if your hair were on fire.”\n- Dogen Zenji\n“The reason why we delay practicing is because we always think that we have more time. When you wake\nup in the morning, you should always say to yourself, “I am still alive – I did not die. I should finish this\ngreat work. There is no tomorrow.””\n- Man-Gong\nTry to buy these books from a local Buddhist or spiritual bookstore. Support them, as they\ncertainly need your support more than soon-to-be-trillionaire Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Not that I\n1383\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nhave anything against Amazon, but I would rather support the local less well-off small businesses.\nWouldn't you?\nNot in any particular order -\nGeneral Buddhadharma\nBuddhism Is Not What You Think by Steve Hagen (see some excerpts in\nhttps://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/04/buddhism-is-not-what-you-think.html)\nBuddhism Plain and Simple by Steve Hagen\nWhat the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula\nMindfulness Practice/Meditation\nWhy do I need meditation training?\nMeditation Now or Never by Steve Hagen\nThe Miracle of Mindfulness: An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation by Thich Nhat Hanh\nPeace is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life by Thich Nhat Hanh\nThe Sun My Heart: Reflections on Mindfulness, Concentration, and Insight by Thich Nhat Hanh\nQuietening the Inner Chatter\nOn Theravada/Vipassana\nGesture of Awareness: A Radical Approach to Time, Space, and Movement by Charles Genoud (excerpts\ncan be found here)\nMastering the Core Teachings of Buddha 2nd Edition by Daniel M.

You see those having right understanding of 'non-doing' are free, yet you see\ndiscipline, focus and peace in them.\nLike just sitting and walking... ...in whatever they endeavor.

She founded the\nSpringwater Center. Toni Packer was able to express the non-dual insight of anatta well along with mind-\nbody drop. Like J. Krishnamurti, she placed emphasis on 'choiceless awareness'.\nJoan Tollifson was a student of Toni, as well as a follower of other neo-Advaita teachings/teachers.\nHowever, besides the great insights expressed in Toni and Joan's books, my main criticism of their\napproach is similar to what Thusness wrote before,\n\"After this insight, one must also be clear of the way of anatta and the path of practice. Many wrongly\nconclude that because there is no-self, there is nothing to do and nothing to practice. This is precisely\nusing \"self view\" to understand \"anatta\" despite having the insight.\nIt does not mean because there is no-self, there is nothing to practice; rather it is because there is no self,\nthere is only ignorance and the chain of afflicted activities. Practice therefore is about overcoming\nignorance and these chain of afflictive activities. There is no agent but there is attention. Therefore\npractice is about wisdom, vipassana, mindfulness and concentration. If there is no mastery over these\npractices, there is no liberation. So one should not bullshit and psycho ourselves into the wrong path of\nno-practice and waste the invaluable insight of anatta. That said, there is the passive mode of practice of\nchoiceless awareness, but one should not misunderstand it as the \"default way\" and such practice can\nhardly be considered \"mastery\" of anything, much less liberation.\"\n1389\nBook Recommendations and Practice Advise\nIn 2013, Thusness said, \"Anapanasati is good. After your insight [into anatta], master a form of technique\nthat can bring you to that the state of anatta without going through a thought process.\" and on choiceless\nawareness Thusness further commented, \"Nothing wrong with choice. Only problem is choice +\nawareness. It is that subtle thought, the thought that misapprehend (Soh: falsely imputes/fabricates) the\nadditional \"agent\".\"\n“A state of freedom is always a natural state, that is a state of mind free from self/Self. You should\nfamiliarize yourself with the taste first. Like doing breathing meditation until there is no-self and left with\nthe inhaling and exhaling... then understand what is meant by releasing.”\nFor those who have not yet gone into one mind, Judith Blackstone has some good techniques for\naccessing non-dual awareness and transparency, although more from the perspective of one mind.\nRelated: Bahiya Sutta, Dispassion and Spontaneous Perfection\nPractice Before AND After Anatta\nNon-Doing and Actualization\nNon-Action\nNon-Meditation and Daily Activities“ - Soh, https://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2017/12/book-\nrecommendations-2017.html\nYin Ling's Book Recommendations\nThank you Yin Ling (Soh: a practioner with insights into anatta and emptiness and has written many\ninsightful posts which I shared in the AtR blog) for answering to my request to compile her book\nrecommendations.\nYin Ling\nesnotm7317tf2lm1694ua3 ·\nFinally sit down and go through my libraries and listed down the books I personally love, both\ndharma and dharma related.\nI won’t categorise them bec I really do not think in category when I buy or read. All of them\ncontributed to my insight and learning in its own way. If I feel it’s too much for me I put it aside and\ncome back to it again when I have new insight, things usually open up. That’s how I read.\nA lot of theravada books I didn’t list, coz I read them early in the path say before 2019-2020.. I don’t\nremember clearly so I won’t list them.\nPls also recommend me some books if not in the list. Much appreciated .\n***\nBook recommendations (Dharma)\n1.
